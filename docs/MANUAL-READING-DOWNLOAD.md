# Manual Reading Materials Download Guide

**When to use:** For paywalled articles that automated download cannot access (typically 85-95% of business communication research).

**Prerequisites:**
- Institutional library access (UWE Bristol, Andrews University, or NEU Vietnam)
- VPN access if working off-campus
- Reading lists generated by `/generate-week` command

## Quick Reference

| Source | Access Method | Typical Success Rate |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Harvard Business Review | UWE Bristol library portal | 100% (with subscription) |
| Sage Publications | DOI resolver + institutional login | 95% |
| Cambridge University Press | DOI resolver + institutional login | 95% |
| Academic books (ISBN) | Library catalog or WorldCat | 60-80% |

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Identify Articles Needing Download

After running `/generate-week [N]`, check the reading list:

```bash
courses/[CODE]/weeks/week-XX/output/readings/READING-LIST.md
```

Look for articles marked with ❌ under "Articles Requiring Institutional Access"

### 2. Access UWE Bristol Library Portal

**URL:** https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/library

**Login Process:**
1. Click "Log in" or "Off-campus access"
2. Authenticate with UWE credentials
3. May require 2FA/MFA verification

**Finding Resources:**
- Use "Database A-Z" for HBR, JSTOR, etc.
- Use "Journal Finder" for specific journal titles
- Use DOI links for direct article access

### 3. Download Articles by Type

#### HBR Articles (Most Common)

**Method 1: Direct Database Access**
1. Navigate to Harvard Business Review database through library portal
2. Search by title or author
3. Download PDF (look for "PDF Full Text" link)

**Method 2: DOI Link**
1. Copy DOI from reading list (e.g., `10.1287/mnsc.2023.4567`)
2. Visit https://doi.org/[DOI] while connected to VPN/library
3. Should redirect to full text with institutional access
4. Download PDF

#### Academic Journal Articles (Sage, Wiley, etc.)

**Process:**
1. Copy DOI from reading list
2. Visit https://doi.org/[DOI]
3. Institutional login will trigger automatically
4. Click "Download PDF" or "View PDF"

**Troubleshooting:**
- If paywall appears, ensure VPN is active
- Try accessing through library's "Journal Finder" instead
- Check if article is available through ResearchGate (author uploads)

#### Academic Books

**Process:**
1. Search UWE library catalog by ISBN or title
2. Check for e-book availability (often chapter downloads)
3. If unavailable, try:
   - WorldCat (https://www.worldcat.org)
   - Andrews University library (secondary access)
   - Google Books preview (partial access)

### 4. Save Downloaded PDFs

**Location:**
```
courses/[CODE]/weeks/week-XX/output/readings/
```

**Naming Convention:**
```
Author-Year-Title.pdf
```

**Examples:**
- `Shannon-1948-A-Mathematical-Theory-of-Communication.pdf`
- `Spitzberg-1984-Interpersonal-Communication-Competence.pdf`
- `Mayer-2009-Multimedia-Learning.pdf`

**Rules:**
- Use last name of first author only
- Remove special characters from title
- Limit title to ~50 characters
- Use hyphens (not spaces) as separators

### 5. Update Reading List (Optional)

After downloading, you can manually update the reading list to mark articles as ✅:

1. Open `READING-LIST.md`
2. Move article from "Requiring Access" to "Downloaded Articles"
3. Change ❌ to ✅
4. Add `- **File:** filename.pdf` line

## Batch Download Strategy

For efficiency, download all articles from one source at once:

### HBR Articles (High Priority)

BCI2AU course has multiple HBR articles. Download all in one session:

**Week 1:**
- "How Great Leaders Communicate"
- "How to Communicate Your Company's Strategy Effectively"

**Week 5:**
- "The Science of Persuasion"

**Week 7:**
- "What Makes Storytelling So Effective for Learning?"

**Process:**
1. Access HBR database through UWE portal
2. Search for each article by title
3. Download all PDFs to Downloads folder
4. Move and rename to appropriate week folders

### Sage Publications

**Process:**
1. Copy all Sage DOIs from reading lists
2. Create text file with DOI links
3. Open all links in browser tabs (institutional login persists)
4. Download PDFs from each tab
5. Organize by week

---

## Alternative Access Methods

### ResearchGate / Academia.edu

Many authors upload their own papers (legal self-archiving):

1. Search for article title on ResearchGate
2. Look for author profile with "View PDF" option
3. May require free ResearchGate account
4. Success rate: ~30% for business research

### Author Email Requests

Authors typically respond to PDF requests:

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Request for PDF - [Article Title]

Dear Dr. [Author],

I am a lecturer at [University] preparing materials for a business
communication course. I would be grateful if you could share a PDF
of your article:

[Full Citation]

This is for educational use only and will not be redistributed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Institution]
```

**Success Rate:** 60-80% within 1-2 weeks

### Interlibrary Loan (ILL)

For unavailable resources:

1. Submit ILL request through UWE library
2. Typical turnaround: 3-5 business days
3. Free for most academic articles
4. Useful for rare books or older publications

---

## Quality Checks

After downloading, verify:

- ✅ File opens without errors
- ✅ Complete article (not just abstract or first page)
- ✅ Correct article (check title and authors)
- ✅ Filename follows naming convention
- ✅ Saved in correct week folder

---

## Integration with Package Course

After manually downloading articles, they'll be included when you run:

```bash
/package-course [CODE]
```

The packaging script collects all files from `output/readings/` folders automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Despite VPN

**Possible causes:**
- VPN not properly connected
- Subscription expired/changed
- Publisher changed access model

**Solutions:**
1. Disconnect and reconnect VPN
2. Try library's database portal instead of DOI link
3. Contact UWE library support
4. Try alternative access methods (ResearchGate, author email)

### Downloaded File Won't Open

**Possible causes:**
- Corrupted download
- HTML error page saved as PDF
- Paywall capture page

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size (should be > 100KB for articles)
2. Open in text editor - should start with `%PDF`
3. Re-download from source
4. Try different browser

### Can't Find Article in Library

**Possible causes:**
- Library doesn't subscribe to that journal
- Article too new (embargo period)
- Incorrect DOI/citation

**Solutions:**
1. Search by article title instead of DOI
2. Check alternative databases
3. Use interlibrary loan (ILL)
4. Try author email request

## Expected Time Investment

| Task | Time per Article | Batch Time (40 articles) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| HBR articles | 2-3 minutes | 30-45 min (12 articles) |
| Journal articles | 3-5 minutes | 60-90 min (20 articles) |
| Book chapters | 5-10 minutes | 40-80 min (8 chapters) |
| **Total** | — | **~3 hours** |

**Tips for efficiency:**
- Download all HBR articles in one session (persistent login)
- Queue DOI links in separate browser tabs
- Use download manager for batch file organization
- Rename files immediately after download

---

## Summary

**Automated Download:**
- Handles 5-15% of business communication articles
- Fully automatic, no interaction required
- Creates reading lists for manual follow-up

**Manual Download:**
- Handles remaining 85-95% of articles
- Requires institutional access (UWE Bristol)
- ~3 hours for complete 10-week course
- 100% success rate with proper access

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Run automated download first (`/generate-week [N]`)
2. Review generated reading lists
3. Batch download all HBR articles (largest category)
4. Download remaining articles by DOI
5. Use alternative methods for unavailable resources
6. Verify all files before packaging course
