### 2. **Online Course Completion Rates (Slide 15)**

> "Pink's research shows: If you don't also have autonomy, mastery, and purpose, you'll burn out..."

**Issue:** Pink (2009) is in References but NOT cited inline where claims are made

**Action needed:** Add (Pink, 2009) inline after each claim
