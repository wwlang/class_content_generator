# Tutorial Activity Design Guidelines

**Focus:** Bloom's Application, Analysis, and Evaluation Levels
**Activity Type:** Scenarios, case studies, open-ended questions
**Pedagogy:** Defensible arguments, multiple valid approaches

---

## Purpose & Philosophy

### Why Tutorials Focus on Higher-Order Thinking

**Quizzes test foundational knowledge** (Remembering/Understanding)
- Direct questions with one correct answer
- Based on slide content
- Recall and comprehension

**Tutorials practice assessment skills** (Application/Analysis/Evaluation)
- Scenarios with complexity
- Multiple defensible approaches
- Critical thinking and judgment
- Preparation for graded work

### Core Principle

**Tutorials mirror actual assessments**
- If assignment requires analysis → Tutorial practices analysis
- If project requires evaluation → Tutorial practices evaluation
- Use simplified rubrics from actual grading criteria
- ONE substantial activity beats multiple shallow exercises

---

## Critical Distinction: Quiz vs. Tutorial Questions

### Quiz Questions (Closed)

✅ **Characteristics:**
- Direct, unambiguous questions
- ONE correct answer based on slide content
- No scenarios or complex contexts
- Test recall and understanding

**Example:**
"What is the difference between high-context and low-context communication?"
- A) High-context relies on implicit messages while low-context is explicit ← ONE correct answer
- B) High-context is formal while low-context is informal
- C) High-context is written while low-context is verbal
- D) High-context is only for Asia while low-context is for West

### Tutorial Questions (Open)

✅ **Characteristics:**
- Scenarios with realistic complexity
- Multiple defensible approaches
- Requires justification and reasoning
- Tests application and analysis

**Example:**
"Your company is entering the Vietnamese market. You need to communicate a product delay to local partners. What approach would you take and why?"

**Expected:** Students might choose:
- **Approach 1:** Indirect message emphasizing relationship and shared problem-solving (high-context appropriate)
- **Approach 2:** Clear timeline with apology and solutions (transparency builds trust)
- **Approach 3:** In-person meeting before written communication (respect and context)

**All can be defensible** depending on student's reasoning and connection to course concepts.

## Bloom's Taxonomy: Higher-Order Levels

### Application Level

**Cognitive processes:** Apply, execute, implement, use, demonstrate, solve

**Tutorial activities:**
- Apply frameworks to real situations
- Use concepts to solve problems
- Transfer knowledge to new contexts
- Execute procedures in specific scenarios

**Example activities:**
- "Use Cialdini's principles to design a persuasive email"
- "Apply the AIDA model to this product launch scenario"
- "Demonstrate active listening in a roleplay conflict resolution"

**Key features:**
- Clear framework/concept to apply
- New situation (not from slides)
- Students must transfer knowledge
- Multiple implementation approaches possible

### Analysis Level

**Cognitive processes:** Analyze, differentiate, organize, attribute, compare, deconstruct

**Tutorial activities:**
- Break down complex situations
- Compare multiple approaches and their implications
- Identify assumptions and unstated premises
- Examine relationships between elements

**Example activities:**
- "Analyze this crisis communication response - what worked and what didn't?"
- "Compare two persuasive messages - which techniques does each use?"
- "Identify the cultural assumptions in this business proposal"

**Key features:**
- Complex material to examine
- Require identification of patterns, relationships, assumptions
- Students must explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Multiple valid analyses possible with different emphases

### Evaluation Level

**Cognitive processes:** Evaluate, judge, critique, defend, justify, recommend

**Tutorial activities:**
- Judge effectiveness of strategies
- Defend recommendations with reasoning
- Critique arguments using criteria
- Make and justify decisions

**Example activities:**
- "Evaluate this presentation using the rubric criteria - what grade would you assign and why?"
- "Recommend the best communication strategy for this stakeholder - justify your choice"
- "Critique this email using professional communication standards"

**Key features:**
- Require judgment based on criteria
- Students must defend their evaluation
- Criteria can be rubrics, frameworks, or principles
- Different evaluations possible with solid reasoning

---

## Designing Open-Ended Activities

### Principle 1: Use Realistic Scenarios

**Characteristics of good scenarios:**
- Based on authentic situations students might face
- Include enough context to apply concepts
- Have complexity (multiple stakeholders, competing priorities, cultural considerations)
- No single "textbook" answer

**Example:**
"You're an intern at a Vietnamese startup. Your manager asks you to write an email declining a partnership with a large international company. The company's CEO is friends with your manager. How would you approach this communication?"

**Why it works:**
- Realistic for business students
- Multiple considerations (relationship, culture, professionalism, hierarchy)
- Requires applying course concepts (high/low context, stakeholder communication, professional tone)
- Several defensible approaches

### Principle 2: Ask "What Would You Do?" Not "What Is the Answer?"

❌ **CLOSED:** "What is the best way to communicate bad news?"
✅ **OPEN:** "How would you communicate this delay to your client, and why?"

❌ **CLOSED:** "Which communication channel should you use?"
✅ **OPEN:** "What communication approach would you recommend and what factors influenced your choice?"

**The difference:**
- "What is..." implies one right answer
- "What would you..." invites personal strategy
- "Why?" requires reasoning and justification

### Principle 3: Require Justification

**Every tutorial activity should ask students to:**
1. Make a choice/decision/recommendation
2. Explain their reasoning
3. Connect to course concepts/frameworks
4. Consider alternatives

**Activity template:**
```
Scenario: [Realistic situation]

Your task:
1. What approach would you take?
2. Why is this approach appropriate for this situation?
3. Which course concepts/frameworks support your choice?
4. What alternative approaches did you consider and why did you not choose them?
```

### Principle 4: Welcome Multiple Valid Solutions

**Design activities where:**
- Different strategies can work depending on priorities
- Trade-offs exist between approaches
- Cultural context affects what's appropriate
- Student reasoning matters more than specific choice

**In peer review:**
- Students compare approaches, not find "errors"
- Focus on quality of reasoning, not uniformity of answers
- Identify strengths in different strategies

**In debrief:**
- Highlight 2-3 different valid approaches
- Discuss trade-offs and contexts where each works
- Connect all approaches to rubric criteria

## Activity Structure Best Practices

### Setup (5 minutes)

**Provide:**
- Clear, numbered instructions
- Scenario or case study materials
- Rubric or evaluation criteria (simplified, 3-4 key dimensions)
- Time expectations

**Clarify:**
- What deliverable they're creating
- How it connects to graded assessment
- What "success" looks like (but multiple paths exist)

### Individual Work (20 minutes)

**Students:**
- Apply concepts to scenario
- Create deliverable (email, proposal, analysis, recommendation)
- Use template/framework provided

**Instructor:**
- Circulates with rubric checklist
- Asks guiding questions (not giving answers)
- Notes patterns for debrief

**Key:** Focus on process (are they using frameworks?) not convergence (are they all doing it the same way?)

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**NOT error-finding** - This is comparison of approaches

**Provide sentence starters:**
- "Your approach of [X] is effective because..."
- "I approached this differently by [Y] because..."
- "One strength of your reasoning is..."
- "Have you considered [alternative framework/perspective]?"

**Focus on:**
- Quality of reasoning
- Connection to course concepts
- Alignment with rubric criteria
- Trade-offs in different approaches

### Revision (10 minutes)

**Students:**
- Consider peer feedback
- Refine reasoning or strengthen connection to concepts
- Self-assess against rubric
- Identify one area for improvement

**NOT:** Change answer to match peer's approach
**YES:** Strengthen justification, add concept connection, clarify reasoning

### Debrief (10 minutes)

**Instructor facilitates:**
- "What different approaches did people take?" (2-3 students share)
- "What did all effective approaches have in common?" (rubric alignment)
- "What trade-offs exist between strategies?" (context dependency)
- "How does this connect to the [assessment name]?" (bridge to graded work)

**Key message:** "Multiple approaches worked because they all [used clear reasoning / connected to concepts / met rubric criteria]"

## Cultural Considerations for Vietnamese Students

### Challenge: Hierarchical Culture and Peer Critique

**Vietnamese students may:**
- Hesitate to critique peers (respecting harmony)
- Provide vague positive feedback ("good job")
- Defer to perceived "smarter" students
- Feel uncomfortable with open disagreement

**Solutions:**

**1. Frame as comparison, not criticism:**
- "Compare approaches" not "critique each other"
- "What did your partner do differently?" not "What's wrong with this?"

**2. Provide structured sentence starters:**
- "One strength I notice is..."
- "I took a different approach by..."
- "This would be even stronger if..."

**3. Emphasize learning over judgment:**
- "We're exploring different strategies together"
- "Diversity of approaches helps us all learn"
- "No single 'right' answer - focus on reasoning"

**4. Model with instructor examples first:**
- Show two different strong approaches
- Demonstrate comparative language
- Normalize multiple valid solutions

### Challenge: Risk Aversion and "Right Answer" Seeking

**Vietnamese students may:**
- Wait for instructor to reveal "the answer"
- Feel anxious when ambiguity exists
- Seek conformity with classmates
- Prefer structured, clear-cut solutions

**Solutions:**

**1. Explicitly state multiple solutions exist:**
- "Today's activity has no single right answer"
- "Your reasoning matters more than your specific choice"
- "I'm looking for strong justification, not agreement"

**2. Show exemplars with variety:**
- Display 2-3 different A-level approaches
- Highlight what makes each strong (despite differences)
- Connect to rubric: all meet criteria differently

**3. Reward reasoning, not specific answers:**
- Give participation credit for defended positions
- Praise strong justifications even when you'd choose differently
- Point out "interesting perspective" for novel approaches

**4. Build confidence gradually:**
- Start with more structured scenarios (fewer variables)
- Increase ambiguity as semester progresses
- Celebrate when students take intellectual risks

## Examples: Quiz vs. Tutorial Questions

### Topic: Cross-Cultural Communication

**QUIZ (Understanding):**
"According to Meyer's framework, what is the main characteristic of high-context communication?"
- A) Direct and explicit messages
- B) Reliance on implicit messages and shared context
- C) Written rather than verbal
- D) Used only in business settings

**ONE correct answer** (B), based on slide content.

---

**TUTORIAL (Application/Evaluation):**
"You're preparing to negotiate with a Japanese business partner about extending a project deadline. Your company culture is low-context (direct communication), but you want to adapt to their high-context culture.

Draft the opening paragraph of your email. Then explain:
1. What communication strategies did you use to adapt to high-context culture?
2. Which course concepts guided your choices?
3. What alternative approaches did you consider?"

**Multiple valid approaches:**
- Indirect message emphasizing relationship
- Mixture of context-setting before request
- Apology and shared problem framing
- In-person meeting proposal before written confirmation

**All defensible** if students justify with course concepts and cultural awareness.
