# Quiz Question Design Guidelines

**Focus:** Bloom's Remembering and Understanding Levels
**Question Type:** Multiple-choice with ONE correct answer
**Content Source:** Slide content ONLY (excluding speaker notes)

---

## Purpose & Learning Objectives

### Why Quizzes Focus on Lower-Order Thinking

**Quizzes test foundational knowledge:**
- **Remembering:** Recall key terms, definitions, frameworks, major theorists
- **Understanding:** Classify concepts, compare/contrast, explain differences, identify examples

**Assessments test higher-order thinking:**
- Application, Analysis, Evaluation tested through assignments, projects, presentations
- Tutorials practice these higher-order skills with scenarios and open-ended questions

### Two Types of Quiz Questions

**1. Tutorial Quiz Practice (Weekly)**
- 6-10 questions covering THAT week's content
- Helps students prepare for graded quizzes
- Tests recall and understanding of the week
- Includes answer key with explanations

**2. Graded Quiz Assessments (Multiple Weeks)**
- ~2 questions per core concept/framework
- Example: Quiz 2 covers Weeks 4-6 (6-8 core concepts = 12-16 questions)
- Broader coverage, higher stakes

---

## Content Source Rules

### What to Test

✅ **Slide content ONLY** (consistent across all instructors)
- Framework definitions and components
- Key concepts from core content slides
- Major theorist attributions (e.g., "Who developed Drive Theory?" → Pink)
- Comparisons and classifications presented on slides

✅ **Core concepts from:**
- Section break topics (3-6 per lecture)
- Framework slides with major theorist citations
- Content slides directly tied to learning objectives

### What to SKIP

❌ **Speaker notes** (varies by instructor - unfair to test)
❌ **Vocabulary slides** (reference aids, not core content)
❌ **References slides** (except major framework creators)
❌ **Minor examples** (unless central to concept)
❌ **Transition slides** (not substantive content)

### Identifying Core Concepts

**Use section breaks as guide:**
- Each section break marks a core concept/framework
- 3-6 section breaks per lecture = 3-6 testable concepts
- Tutorial practice: 1-2 questions per section break topic
- Graded assessment: ~2 questions per core concept across all covered weeks

## Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

### Remembering Level

**Cognitive processes:** Recall, recognize, identify, define, list, name

**Question characteristics:**
- Direct and unambiguous
- Test single facts or definitions
- Straightforward retrieval, no interpretation required
- Clear terminology from course materials

**Good examples:**

**Example 1 (Definition):**
"According to Hofstede's framework, what does 'power distance' measure?"
- A) How people handle uncertainty and ambiguity
- B) The extent to which less powerful members accept unequal power distribution
- C) The preference for achievement vs. relationships
- D) The orientation toward future vs. present

**Example 2 (Recognition):**
"Who developed the Drive theory of motivation?"
- A) Peter Senge
- B) Daniel Pink
- C) Carol Dweck
- D) Robert Cialdini

**Example 3 (Recall):**
"How many principles are in Cialdini's framework of persuasion?"
- A) 4
- B) 6
- C) 8
- D) 10

### Understanding Level

**Cognitive processes:** Explain, summarize, classify, compare, interpret, exemplify, infer

**Question characteristics:**
- Require interpretation, not just recall
- Test relationships between concepts
- Ask for classification or categorization
- Compare/contrast concepts
- Use paraphrasing (not exact wording from slides)

**Good examples:**

**Example 1 (Classification):**
"Which of the following is an example of high-context communication?"
- A) A direct email stating 'The project deadline is Friday'
- B) A message saying 'We should discuss the timeline when convenient'
- C) A detailed report with explicit action items
- D) A bulleted list of requirements

**Example 2 (Comparison):**
"What is the main difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation?"
- A) Intrinsic comes from within while extrinsic comes from external rewards
- B) Intrinsic is stronger while extrinsic is weaker
- C) Intrinsic is for students while extrinsic is for employees
- D) Intrinsic requires goals while extrinsic does not

**Example 3 (Interpretation):**
"In Meyer's framework, cultures that rely heavily on implicit messages and shared context are called:"
- A) Low-context cultures
- B) High-context cultures
- C) Individualist cultures
- D) Collectivist cultures

---

## Question Writing Rules

### Rule 1: Direct Questions, NOT Scenarios

❌ **BAD (scenario for recall):**
"Maria is preparing a quarterly update for her team of 15 people at 2pm Friday in Conference Room B. Which of the following describes nonverbal communication?"

✅ **GOOD (direct recall):**
"Which of the following describes nonverbal communication?"
- A) Written memos and emails
- B) Body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice
- C) Formal reports and presentations
- D) Phone calls and video conferences

**Why:** Scenarios test application/analysis. For recall and understanding, ask directly.

### Rule 2: Test ONE Concept Per Question

✅ **GOOD:** "What is the first step in the AIDA model?"
❌ **BAD:** "What are the four steps of the AIDA model and which is most important?"

**Why:** Testing multiple concepts creates ambiguity and confuses students.

### Rule 3: Write Clear Stems That Stand Alone

✅ **GOOD:** "According to Argenti's framework, which stakeholder group should receive crisis communication first?"
❌ **BAD:** "Crisis communication should go to ___ first."

**Why:** Question format is clearer than incomplete statements.

### Rule 4: Create 3-4 Plausible Distractors

**Distractor = wrong answer that seems reasonable**

**Base on common misconceptions:**
- Use actual student errors when possible
- Make all options seem plausible
- Avoid obviously silly options

**Example:**
"What does 'SMART' stand for in goal-setting?"
- A) Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound ← CORRECT
- B) Strategic, Meaningful, Actionable, Realistic, Trackable ← Plausible synonym
- C) Simple, Manageable, Attainable, Reasonable, Timely ← Similar words
- D) Significant, Motivating, Aligned, Rewarding, Targeted ← Related concepts

**Why:** If distractors are implausible, students guess correctly without knowing content.

### Rule 5: Ensure ONE Clearly Correct Answer

✅ **GOOD:** Clear right/wrong distinction based on slide content
❌ **BAD:** Multiple options could be "partially correct" or "best depending on context"

**Test your question:** Can you explain why EACH distractor is definitively wrong based on slide content?

### Rule 6: NEVER Use These Options

❌ "All of the above"
- If students identify 2 correct, they pick this without thinking
- If students identify 1 wrong, they eliminate immediately
- Reduces cognitive processing

❌ "None of the above"
- Doesn't reveal what students actually know
- Can be confusing in comprehension questions

❌ Absolute words (always, never, all, none, only, completely)
- Clues test-takers that answer is likely wrong
- Exception: If using in ALL options to avoid cueing

### Rule 7: Use Parallel Structure in All Options

✅ **GOOD:**
- All start with same part of speech (all verbs, all noun phrases)
- Similar length across all options
- Same level of specificity

❌ **BAD:**
- A) Written communication (2 words)
- B) Talking to someone face-to-face about a project (9 words)
- C) Email (1 word)
- D) Phone calls and video conferences (5 words)

**Why:** Length and structure inconsistencies clue the correct answer.

### Rule 8: Avoid Grammar/Length Cues

❌ **BAD:** Stem ends with "a" but some options start with vowels
"Persuasive communication requires a ___"
- A) emotional appeal ← grammar matches
- B) logical structure ← grammar matches
- C) AIDA model ← grammar doesn't match (clue it's wrong)

✅ **GOOD:** Rewrite to avoid "a/an" or ensure all options match

### Rule 9: Use Simple, Clear Language

**Test content knowledge, not reading comprehension**

❌ **BAD:** "In the contemporary organizational context, which modality of interpersonal exchange demonstrates optimal efficacy for urgent communication?"

✅ **GOOD:** "Which communication method works best for urgent messages?"

### Rule 10: Match Bloom's Level to Question Type

**Remembering = Recall/Define/Recognize**
- "What is [term]?"
- "Who developed [framework]?"
- "How many components in [model]?"

**Understanding = Classify/Compare/Interpret**
- "Which category does [item] belong to?"
- "What is the difference between [A] and [B]?"
- "Which example demonstrates [concept]?"

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Repetition Clues

❌ **BAD:** Repeating exact words from stem only in correct answer

"What is the key principle of active listening?"
- A) Paying full attention to the speaker ← repeats "listening" concept
- B) Taking notes
- C) Asking questions
- D) Nodding

**Fix:** Use related words in all options or avoid repetition entirely.

### Pitfall 2: Complexity for Complexity's Sake

❌ **BAD:** Unnecessary complexity that tests reading comprehension

✅ **GOOD:** Clear, accessible language appropriate to students' level

### Pitfall 3: Negative Wording

❌ **AVOID:** "Which of the following is NOT a component of..."
❌ **WORSE:** "Which is not uncommon..." (double negative)

✅ **BETTER:** Ask positively: "Which IS a component of..."

**Exception:** Sometimes necessary, but use sparingly and make "NOT" visually obvious.

### Pitfall 4: Testing Trivia vs. Core Concepts

❌ **BAD:** "In what year was Hofstede's research published?"
✅ **GOOD:** "According to Hofstede, what does power distance measure?"

### Pitfall 5: Multiple Partially Correct Answers

❌ **BAD:** Question where 2+ options could be defended based on slide content

This happens when:
- Question asks for "best" without clear criteria
- Slide content doesn't definitively support one answer
- Distractors are drawn from related but unaddressed content

**Fix:** Ensure slide content clearly supports ONE answer and contradicts all others.

## Answer Key Format

### Required Elements

For each question, provide:

1. **Correct answer letter** (A, B, C, or D)
2. **Why it's correct** (reference to specific slide content)
3. **Why each distractor is wrong** (what misconception it represents)
4. **Common mistake note** (if applicable)

### Example Answer Key Entry

**Question 3: What is the main difference between formal and informal communication?**

**Correct Answer: B**

**Why B is correct:**
"Formal communication follows official channels and protocols while informal is spontaneous" - This matches Slide 12 definition of formal vs. informal communication channels.

**Why A is wrong:**
"Formal communication uses email while informal uses chat" - Too narrow. Slide 12 shows formal can use multiple channels, not just email.

**Why C is wrong:**
"Formal communication is always written while informal is always verbal" - Incorrect. Slide 12 shows formal can be verbal (official meetings) and informal can be written (quick notes).

**Why D is wrong:**
"Formal communication is only between managers while informal is between peers" - Incorrect. Slide 12 shows formal communication can be peer-to-peer following official channels.

**Teaching note:** Students often confuse the *channel* (email vs. chat) with the *structure* (official protocols vs. spontaneous). Emphasize that formal = following organizational protocols, regardless of medium.

## GIFT Format Export for Moodle

### Overview

**All tutorial quiz questions are automatically exported to Moodle GIFT format** as part of the `/generate-week` workflow. This creates a ready-to-upload quiz file for your Moodle course.

**File generated:** `week-[N]-quiz.gift` (in same folder as tutorial content)

### What is GIFT Format?

GIFT (General Import Format Template) is Moodle's text-based quiz import format:
- Plain text file with special syntax
- Supports multiple-choice questions
- Includes feedback for correct and incorrect answers
- Can be directly uploaded to Moodle

### How It Works

**Automated export process:**

1. After generating tutorial-content.md and tutorial-tutor-notes.md
2. Run `python tools/export_quiz_to_gift.py courses/[COURSE]/weeks/week-[N]`
3. Tool automatically:
   - Extracts questions from tutorial-content.md
   - Extracts answer explanations from tutorial-tutor-notes.md
   - Validates question/answer alignment
   - Formats to GIFT with feedback
   - Outputs `week-[N]-quiz.gift`

**No manual formatting required!**

### GIFT Format Structure

**Example GIFT question:**

```
::Hofstede's Power Distance::According to Hofstede's framework, which dimension measures the extent to which less powerful members accept unequal power distribution?{
=Power Distance #Power distance specifically measures acceptance of hierarchical inequality in organizations and societies.
~Uncertainty Avoidance #This measures comfort with ambiguity, not power distribution.
~Individualism vs. Collectivism #This measures group orientation, not power acceptance.
~Long-term Orientation #This measures time perspective, not power dynamics.
}
```

**Format elements:**
- `::Topic::` - Question title (from your question topic)
- `Question text` - Your question stem
- `{` and `}` - Wrap the answer choices
- `=` - Marks the correct answer
- `~` - Marks distractors (wrong answers)
- `#Feedback` - Explanation shown after answering (from your tutor notes)

### Special Character Escaping

GIFT format requires escaping these characters:
- `{`, `}`, `=`, `~`, `#`, `:`, `\`

**The export tool handles this automatically.** You don't need to manually escape characters in your tutorial-content.md or tutorial-tutor-notes.md files. Write questions normally, and the tool escapes when generating GIFT.

### Uploading to Moodle

**To import your quiz into Moodle:**

1. Go to your Moodle course
2. Navigate to **Question bank**
3. Choose **Import**
4. Select **GIFT format**
5. Upload your `week-[N]-quiz.gift` file
6. Questions import with full feedback
7. Create a quiz activity and add questions from bank

**Batch upload option:**
- Generate all weeks first
- Upload all GIFT files at once at end of semester
- Organize by categories (Week 1, Week 2, etc.)

### Quality Validation

**Before uploading to Moodle, verify:**

- [ ] File exists: `week-[N]-quiz.gift`
- [ ] Question count matches (6-10 questions)
- [ ] Open file and check:
  - [ ] Category line: `$CATEGORY: Week [N]`
  - [ ] Each question has `=` for correct answer
  - [ ] Each distractor has `~`
  - [ ] Feedback included after `#` for all options
  - [ ] Special characters properly escaped

**Test import:**
- Upload to Moodle test course first
- Preview questions to verify formatting
- Check that feedback displays correctly
- Adjust tutorial files if needed, re-export

### Troubleshooting

**"No quiz questions found"**
- Check tutorial-content.md has `## QUIZ PRACTICE` section
- Verify questions formatted as specified (numbered, A-D options)

**"Question number mismatch"**
- Ensure question numbers match between tutorial-content.md and tutorial-tutor-notes.md
- Check for skipped numbers or duplicates

**"Correct answer not in options"**
- Verify answer key letter (A, B, C, D) matches an available option
- Check for typos in answer key

**Moodle import errors**
- Check for unescaped special characters manually if needed
- Verify GIFT syntax using Moodle's format documentation
- Test with single question first

### Benefits of Automated Export

**Consistency:**
- Same questions students practice in tutorial
- Same explanations tutors use when reviewing
- No manual transcription errors

**Efficiency:**
- Saves 15-20 minutes per week
- No copy-paste formatting
- Batch upload all weeks at once

**Quality:**
- Answer explanations from tutor notes automatically included
- Students get immediate feedback after quiz
- Reinforces correct understanding

**Flexibility:**
- Questions stored in Moodle question bank
- Reuse across semesters
- Mix questions from multiple weeks

## Examples: Good vs. Bad Questions

### Example Set 1: Definition (Remembering)

❌ **BAD:**
"You're managing a project with Vietnamese and American team members. Vietnamese members rarely speak up while Americans are vocal. What explains this?"

"According to Hofstede's framework, which dimension measures the extent to which less powerful members accept unequal power distribution?"
- A) Uncertainty Avoidance
- B) Power Distance
- C) Individualism vs. Collectivism
- D) Long-term Orientation

### Example Set 2: Comparison (Understanding)

❌ **BAD:**
"What's better: high-context or low-context communication?"
- Problem: No "better" - both have contexts where they're appropriate; subjective

✅ **GOOD:**
"What is the key difference between high-context and low-context communication?"
- A) High-context is formal while low-context is informal
- B) High-context relies on implicit messages while low-context is explicit
- C) High-context is written while low-context is verbal
- D) High-context is for business while low-context is personal

### Example Set 3: Application Recognition (Understanding)

❌ **BAD:**
"You need to decline a partnership with a Japanese company. What should you do?"
- Problem: Scenario tests application (higher-order); multiple approaches defensible

✅ **GOOD:**
"Which of the following is an example of high-context communication?"
- A) "We cannot move forward with this partnership"
- B) "We appreciate your proposal and will need more time to evaluate"
- C) An email with explicit rejection and detailed reasons
- D) A phone call stating "no" directly
