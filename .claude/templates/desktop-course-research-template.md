## Part 1: Syllabus Research

Research and save to: `[FULL-PATH-TO-RESEARCH-FOLDER]/syllabus-research.md`

### 1.1 Course Description Research

Find how 3-5 top schools describe their equivalent course:
- What themes do they emphasize?
- What makes their course distinctive?
- What outcomes do they promise?

### 1.2 Learning Objectives Research

**Best practice:** 5-8 course-level outcomes total (per Cornell, UC Berkeley research).

Research from top schools:
- What competencies do they list?
- What action verbs do they use?
- How do they structure outcomes?

### 1.3 Weekly Topic Structure

How do top schools sequence this subject over 10-12 weeks?

Complete in this order:

1. **Syllabus research** → Save to `syllabus-research.md`
2. **Week 1** → Save to `week-01-research.md`
3. **Week 2** → Save to `week-02-research.md`
4. Continue through all weeks...
5. **Final check** → List directory to verify all files exist

---

## If Research Stalls

**Can't find seminal works:**
- Broader search terms
- Check HBR "classic" tags
- Ask what frameworks courses typically reference

**All recent paywalled:**
- Check ResearchGate
- Try `[title] pdf` search
- Use HBR over academic journals

**Concept not covered:**
- May need 3 articles
- Check alternative names
- Confirm concept is required

**MCP filesystem issues:**
- Verify Desktop settings
- Check allowed paths
- Fallback: output to chat, copy manually
