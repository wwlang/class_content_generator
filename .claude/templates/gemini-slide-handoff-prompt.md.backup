<context>
Course: {{COURSE_CODE}} - {{COURSE_NAME}}
Week: {{WEEK_NUMBER}}
Topic: {{TOPIC}}
Institution: {{UNIVERSITY}}
Instructor: {{INSTRUCTOR_NAME}}
Total Slides: {{SLIDE_COUNT}}
</context>

<instructions>
1. Create a Google Slides presentation with exactly {{SLIDE_COUNT}} slides
2. Begin with a title slide containing: topic title, course code and name, university/institution, and instructor name
3. Reproduce the EXACT wording from the lecture content for each slide - preserve all text as written
4. Be creative about visuals on the slides - generate pictures, infographics and other supporting icons to emphasize messages within the slides
5. Include academic citations in slide footers when frameworks or theories are referenced (e.g., Minto, 1987)
6. Leave speaker notes empty - these will be added separately
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Preserve exact wording because students receive these slides as study materials and need consistency with lecture recordings
- No speaker notes because Claude will add detailed instructor notes in a later step
- Consistent Modern Bright Pastel Corporate style across all slides for professional brand identity
</constraints>
