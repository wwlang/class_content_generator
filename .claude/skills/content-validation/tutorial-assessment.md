# Tutorial-Assessment Alignment Validation

## Required Elements

### 1. Assessment Connection Statement (CRITICAL)
Every tutorial must have an explicit statement linking to the Assessment Handbook:

**Good:**
> **Assessment Connection:** This activity prepares you for Portfolio Task 1 (Internal Email). See Assessment Handbook Section 3.1 for the full scenario and rubric.

**Bad:**
- No mention of assessment
- Generic "this will help with your assignments"
- References wrong assessment for this week

### 2. Scaled Activity (CRITICAL)
Tutorial activity must practice the SAME skill/format as the assessment, but smaller:

| Assessment | Tutorial Activity |
|------------|-------------------|
| 500-word email | 150-word email |
| Full stakeholder analysis | Analysis of 2 stakeholders |
| Complete presentation | 3-slide pitch |

**Bad patterns:**
- Activity completely different from assessment type
- Activity same size as assessment (not scaled)
- Generic skill practice not tied to specific assessment

### 3. Success Criteria from Rubric (WARNING)
Criteria must come from Assessment Handbook rubric, not invented:

**Good:**
> **Success Criteria:**
> - Uses pyramid structure (from Rubric: Structure criterion)
> - Professional tone, no contractions (from Rubric: Tone criterion)
> - Clear call to action in final paragraph (from Rubric: Clarity criterion)

**Bad:**
- Invented criteria not in rubric
- Vague criteria like "well-written"
- Missing criteria entirely

## Validation Process

1. Read Assessment Handbook to understand:
   - Which assessment each week prepares for
   - The scenarios for each assessment
   - The rubric criteria

2. For each tutorial, check:
   - [ ] Has "Assessment Connection" section?
   - [ ] References correct assessment?
   - [ ] Activity is scaled version of assessment?
   - [ ] Success criteria match rubric?

## Week-Assessment Mapping

Check syllabus or course-info.md for the mapping. Typical pattern:
- Weeks 1-3 → Portfolio Task 1
- Weeks 4-6 → Portfolio Task 2
- Weeks 7-9 → Portfolio Task 3
- Week 10 → Presentation preparation
