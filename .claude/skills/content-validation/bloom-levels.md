# Bloom's Level Validation

## Quiz Question Cognitive Levels

### REMEMBERING (Lower-order)
- Recall facts, definitions, sequences, lists
- Identify components of a framework
- Match terms to definitions
- Question stems: "What is...", "Name the...", "Which of the following is..."
- **NO scenarios or application required**

### UNDERSTANDING (Higher-order for quizzes)
- Explain WHY something works
- Distinguish between similar concepts
- Question stems: "What is the PURPOSE of...", "Why does...", "What is the DIFFERENCE between..."
- Brief context is OK, but focus is on comprehension, not application

### APPLYING (Too high for weekly quizzes)
- Use knowledge in new situations
- Apply frameworks to scenarios
- "Given this situation, which approach..."
- **These belong in assessments, not weekly quizzes**

## Common Mismatches to Flag

| Stated Level | Actual Pattern | Issue |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Remembering | Scenario + "what should..." | Actually Application |
| Remembering | "Why does X work?" | Actually Understanding |
| Understanding | "Name the 4 components of..." | Actually Remembering |
| Understanding | Complex scenario requiring judgment | Actually Application |

## Validation Prompt

For each quiz question:
1. Check the `**Category:**` field for stated level
2. Analyze question stem and content
3. Determine actual cognitive demand
4. Flag if mismatch found

**CRITICAL**: Question labeled Remembering but requires scenario analysis
**WARNING**: Question labeled Understanding but is pure recall
