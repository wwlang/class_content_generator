APA 7th edition. Standard format—focus on project-specific rules below.

## Requirements Per Week 🔐

| With working DOI/URL | All |

## Citation Placement

- **Statistics:** Always cite source
- **Frameworks:** Cite originator (e.g., "Cialdini's 6 Principles (Cialdini, 1984)")
- **Quotes:** Include page number if available
- **Case studies:** Cite source or note "adapted from"

## Anti-Patterns

- Uncited statistics ("73% of managers...")
- Framework without attribution
- Broken or missing URLs
- Inconsistent format within same document

## Verification 🔒

Before finalizing:
1. WebFetch each URL to confirm accessibility
2. Verify DOI resolves correctly
3. Check author names match source

## Example (Slide with Citation)

```markdown
## The Scarcity Principle

Limited availability increases perceived value (Cialdini, 2021).

**Key insight:** "When something becomes less available, we want it more—
even if we didn't want it before" (Cialdini, 2021, p. 238).

Vietnamese context: Shopee flash sales leverage scarcity + social proof
(Nguyen & Tran, 2023).

## If URLs Break

- Check Wayback Machine: `web.archive.org/web/[URL]`
- Search author + title on Google Scholar for alternate
- Note in references: "[Archived version]" with archive URL
