# Lecture Structure Skill

## Structure (22-30 Slides) 🔐

### Opening (4-6 slides)
1. **Hook** - Compelling stat, question, or story
2. **Objectives** - 3-5 measurable outcomes (Bloom's verbs)
3. **Assessment connection** - How this week prepares for graded work
4. **Roadmap** - Visual preview of lecture segments

### Core Content (14-20 slides)
Organize into **3-4 segments** of ~5 slides each:
- Segment intro (context/why this matters)
- Key concept explanation
- Framework or model (if applicable)
- Example or case study
- Application or mini-activity

**Pacing:** Switch segment every 15-20 minutes. Add engagement activity at each transition.

### Wrap-up (4-6 slides)
1. **Key takeaways** - 3-5 main points
2. **Assessment preview** - What's due, how today helps
3. **Next week preview** - Topic teaser
4. **Resources** - Further reading, tools

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Starting with definitions (boring - use hook instead)
- >8 slides without engagement break
- Concept slides without examples
- Ending without clear next steps

## Content Limits Per Slide

| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Body text | 150-200 words |
| Bullets | 6-8 max |
| Concepts | 1 main idea |

**If over:** Split into Part 1/2 or move detail to speaker notes.
