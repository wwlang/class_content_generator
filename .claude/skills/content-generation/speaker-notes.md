# Speaker Notes Skill

## Structure Per Slide 🔐

```markdown
## Speaker Notes

**Opening:** (1-2 bullets)
- Transition from previous slide
- How to introduce this concept

**Key Points:** (3-5 bullets)
- Main concepts to emphasize
- Definitions to clarify
- Analogies to use

**Example/Story:** (1-2 bullets)
- Concrete example (Vietnamese context when possible)
- Real-world application

**Check Understanding:** (1 bullet)
- Question to ask class

**Transition:** (1 bullet)
- Bridge to next slide
```

## Length Guidelines

| Slide Type | Target Words |
|------------|--------------|
| Title/Section | 50-75 |
| Standard content | 150-200 |
| Framework/Model | 200-250 |
| Activity instruction | 100-150 |

## Anti-Patterns

- Reading slide content verbatim
- Generic notes ("explain this concept")
- Missing transitions between slides
- No engagement prompts

## Example (Filled In)

```markdown
## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Last slide we covered the 6 principles—now let's see them in action"

**Key Points:**
- Scarcity works because of loss aversion (Kahneman)
- "Limited time" more effective than "sale"
- Vietnamese e-commerce uses countdown timers heavily

**Example:**
- Shopee flash sales: timer + "only 3 left" = scarcity + social proof combined

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick show of hands—who's bought something because of a countdown timer?"

**Transition:**
- "So scarcity works—but when does it backfire? Let's look at ethical limits..."
```

## Cultural Notes 🔓

- Vietnamese business examples when relevant
- Pronunciation: "Cialdini" = chee-al-DEE-nee
- Quiet groups: use pair-share before full class discussion
