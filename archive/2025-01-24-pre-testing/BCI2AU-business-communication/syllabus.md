# **ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION**

All assignments must be submitted through Moodle:

- Format: Microsoft Word (.docx) or PDF only
- File Naming: StudentNumber_FirstName_Assignment_Date (e.g., 12345678_Lan_Email_Sept15.docx)
- Submission Deadline: 11:59 PM on the due date unless otherwise specified
- Late Submissions: Assignments submitted after deadline may not be accepted (instructor discretion based on circumstances)

# **COURSE POLICIES**

## **Attendance Policy**

Attendance is mandatory and directly impacts your success in this course.

- Attendance will be taken within the first 10 minutes of each class
- Students arriving after attendance is taken will be marked absent
- Students who miss three consecutive classes without official documentation will be removed from the course
- Valid absences require documentation (medical certificate, official university business, etc.)

**Important:** Many in-class activities, workshops, and presentations cannot be made up. Plan to attend every session.

## **Academic Integrity**

All students must maintain the highest standards of academic honesty. Violations include:

- **Plagiarism:** Using others' words or ideas without proper citation
- **Cheating**: Unauthorized collaboration or use of materials during assessments
- **Fabrication**: Making up data, sources, or information
- **AI Misuse**: Submitting AI-generated content as your own original work

**Consequences**: Violations will result in a zero on the assignment and possible failure of the course, plus referral to university disciplinary procedures.

### ***AI and Technology Use Policy***

**Permitted Uses:**
- Grammar and spell-checking tools (Grammarly, etc.)
- Brainstorming and idea generation
- Research assistance and source finding
- Translation support (for non-native English speakers)
- Creating visual designs (Canva, etc.)
- Outlining and organizing thoughts

**Not Permitted:**
- Submitting AI-generated content as your own work
- Having AI write your assignments (full paragraphs, emails, memos, etc.)
- Using AI during quizzes

**Required Disclosure:** Any AI assistance beyond grammar checking must be documented in your assignment submission with a brief note explaining:
- Which AI tool was used
- What it was used for
- How you modified/built upon AI output

**Example Acceptable Disclosure:** "I used ChatGPT to brainstorm potential topics for my persuasive proposal. I selected the topic of flexible work arrangements and wrote the entire proposal myself. I then used Grammarly Premium to check grammar and tone."

**Philosophy:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for your thinking and writing. The goal is for you to develop communication skills that will serve you throughout your career. Over-reliance on AI undermines this goal and your own learning.

## **Group Work Policy**

For the group presentation:

- Groups must be formed with a maximum of 4 students by Week 4
- Groups will be intentionally diverse (mixing backgrounds, skills, perspectives)
- Each group member will complete a peer evaluation form
- Peer evaluations may affect individual grades (±5%)
- Non-contributing members may receive significantly reduced grades
- Team charter must be submitted by Week 5 outlining:
  - Individual roles and responsibilities
  - Communication plan (how/when team will meet)
  - Decision-making process
  - Conflict resolution approach
