## OPENING: LECTURE REVIEW & QUIZ PREPARATION (10 minutes)

### Quick Concept Review

**Three Key Frameworks from Today's Lecture:**

**1. Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions**
- Power Distance: Acceptance of unequal power distribution
- Individualism vs. Collectivism: Individual vs. group priority
- Other dimensions: Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Time Orientation, Indulgence

**2. High-Context vs. Low-Context Communication**
- High-context (Vietnam, Japan, China): Implicit messages, relationship-dependent, indirect
- Low-context (USA, Germany, Australia): Explicit messages, verbal clarity, direct

**3. Brett et al.'s Multicultural Team Strategies**
- Adaptation: Acknowledge differences, work around them
- Structural intervention: Reorganize team composition
- Managerial intervention: Set clear norms early
- Exit: Remove members as last resort

## MAIN ACTIVITY: CROSS-CULTURAL COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS (40 minutes)

### The Scenario

You work for a Vietnamese software company (TechVN) that just won a major contract with a German client (InnovateTech GmbH). The project requires close collaboration between:

- **Vietnamese team (Hanoi):** 6 developers, 1 project manager (you), high-context culture, collectivist, high power distance
- **German team (Munich):** 4 engineers, 1 technical lead, low-context culture, individualist, low power distance
- **Project timeline:** 6 months, weekly video meetings, shared deliverables every 2 weeks

**Week 1 Incident:**

Your first team meeting revealed communication challenges:

1. **German technical lead** opened meeting with direct agenda: "Let's discuss the architecture. I've identified 3 problems with your proposal that need immediate revision." Vietnamese team members went silent and appeared uncomfortable.

2. **Vietnamese project manager** (you) responded: "Thank you for the feedback. We will consider this carefully and discuss internally." German lead seemed frustrated: "I need to know TODAY which approach you'll take. We can't waste time."

3. **Deadline discussion:** German team insisted on rigid 2-week sprint deadlines. Vietnamese team typically builds buffer time for unexpected issues and relationship considerations.

4. **Communication style:** Germans send brief, direct emails with bullet points. Vietnamese team prefers longer context-setting and relationship acknowledgment.

**Your Task:**

As the Vietnamese project manager, develop a **Team Communication Protocol** that bridges these cultural differences and prevents future conflicts. Your protocol will be shared with both teams.

### The Data / Materials

**Cultural Profiles (from Hofstede and Meyer):**

**Vietnam:**
- High power distance (70)
- Collectivist (Individualism: 20)
- High-context communication
- Relationship-based trust (affective)
- Flexible time orientation
- Indirect negative feedback

**Germany:**
- Low power distance (35)
- Individualist (Individualism: 67)
- Low-context communication
- Task-based trust (cognitive)
- Linear time orientation
- Direct negative feedback (though more diplomatic than USA)

### Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:**

Create a **Team Communication Protocol** (1-2 pages) that addresses:

1. **Meeting norms** (How will we run team meetings?)
2. **Feedback protocols** (How will we give and receive critical feedback?)
3. **Decision-making process** (How will we make decisions when we disagree?)
4. **Deadline management** (How will we set and adjust deadlines?)
5. **Written communication style** (What format and tone for emails?)

**Considerations:**

- Use Hofstede's dimensions and Meyer's Culture Map to identify specific friction points
- Apply Brett et al.'s strategies (adaptation, structural intervention, managerial intervention)
- Address both German and Vietnamese cultural needs
- Be explicit and specific (avoid vague statements like "be respectful")
- Consider both synchronous (meetings) and asynchronous (email) communication

**Format Example:**

```
TEAM COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL: TechVN x InnovateTech

1. MEETING NORMS
   - Agenda shared 24 hours in advance (German preference for preparation)
   - First 5 minutes: Context-setting and relationship check-in (Vietnamese preference)
   - Rotate who speaks first to prevent hierarchy bias
   - [Your specific norms...]

2. FEEDBACK PROTOCOLS
   - [Your specific norms...]
```

### Peer Review (10 minutes)

**Exchange protocols with another pair.**

**Review using these criteria:**

- [ ] **Addresses all 5 required elements** (meetings, feedback, decisions, deadlines, communication)
- [ ] **Specific and actionable** (not vague like "be respectful")
- [ ] **Bridges both cultures** (accommodates German AND Vietnamese needs)
- [ ] **Uses course frameworks** (references Hofstede, Meyer, or Brett et al.)

**Provide feedback:**

- **One strength:** "Your protocol effectively addresses [specific cultural gap] by [specific strategy]..."
- **One suggestion:** "Consider adding [specific element] to address [cultural dimension]..."

**Remember:** Different protocols can work depending on team priorities. We're comparing approaches, not finding errors.

---

### Revision & Class Debrief (5 minutes)

**Revision (3 min):** Based on peer feedback, strengthen one element of your protocol.

**Class Debrief (2 min):** Instructor will highlight 2-3 strong examples and discuss trade-offs in different approaches.

## WRAP-UP: PORTFOLIO PREPARATION (10 minutes)

### Written Portfolio Due Week 5

**Three Required Documents:**

**1. Email Series (2 emails)**
- Apply BLUF technique (Week 2)
- Adapt tone based on audience cultural context (Week 4)
- Professional formatting

**2. Persuasive Proposal**
- Use Cialdini's principles strategically (Week 3)
- Know-feel-do framework (Week 1)
- Clear problem-solution-benefit structure

**3. Crisis Communication Response**
- Stakeholder adaptation (Week 1)
- Transparency and trust restoration (Week 4 - trust concepts)
- Speed vs. accuracy balance

### Self-Assessment Questions

Reflect individually (3 minutes):

1. **Email Series:** Have I identified my recipients' cultural contexts? Do I need to adjust for high-context vs. low-context audiences?

2. **Persuasive Proposal:** Which Cialdini principles am I using? Can I explain WHY they're appropriate for this audience?

3. **Crisis Communication:** Have I considered cultural differences in my stakeholder groups? (e.g., Vietnamese employees vs. international investors)

### Next Steps

- **This week:** Draft all three portfolio documents
- **Review:** Grading rubrics (see syllabus - Written Communication Rubric and Crisis Communication Rubric)
- **Office hours:** Available for portfolio feedback before Week 5 deadline
- **Week 5 topic:** AI & Emerging Technologies in Communication

### Final Reminders

- Apply frameworks from Weeks 1-4 in your portfolio
- Use proper citations for any sources (APA 7th edition)
- Proofread carefully - mechanics count (see rubric)
- Submit all three documents in one file via Moodle by Week 5 deadline
