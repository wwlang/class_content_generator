## Quiz 1 Solutions (Weeks 1-3 Content)

### Question 1: Strategic Communication Framework
**According to the know-feel-do framework from Week 1, what is the correct sequence for strategic message design?**

A) What you want audience to do → How you want them to feel → What you want them to know
B) What you want audience to know → How you want them to feel → What you want them to do ← **CORRECT**
C) How you want audience to feel → What you want them to know → What you want them to do
D) What you want audience to do → What you want them to know → How you want them to feel

**Why B is correct:**
The know-feel-do framework follows a logical persuasive sequence: First, provide information (KNOW) that shapes perception, which creates emotional response (FEEL), which motivates behavior (DO). This was covered in Week 1 lecture slide on strategic message design.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Reverses the sequence - you can't get people to act before they know information and feel motivated
- C: Starting with emotion without information foundation is less effective strategic communication
- D: Illogical sequence that doesn't build persuasive momentum

**Common confusion:** Students sometimes think "do" comes first because it's the goal. Clarify: The goal comes last in message design sequence, even though it's the ultimate objective.

**Teaching tip:** Use example: Convincing someone to donate to charity. First they need to KNOW about the cause (information), then FEEL compassion (emotion), then DO the donation (action). Can't skip steps.

### Question 2: Communication Models
**In the Transactional Model of Communication (Week 1), what is the key difference from the Shannon-Weaver model?**

A) The Transactional Model includes a feedback loop
B) The Transactional Model recognizes that both parties are simultaneously senders and receivers ← **CORRECT**
C) The Transactional Model eliminates noise from the communication process
D) The Transactional Model only applies to written communication

**Why B is correct:**
The Transactional Model's defining feature is that communication is simultaneous and multidirectional - both parties send and receive messages at the same time (unlike Shannon-Weaver's linear sender→receiver model). Week 1 lecture emphasized this shift from "taking turns" to "simultaneous exchange."

**Why wrong:**
- A: Shannon-Weaver also includes feedback, though it's more linear
- C: All communication models include noise - no model eliminates it
- D: Transactional Model applies to all communication forms, not just written

**Common confusion:** Students confuse feedback loop (present in multiple models) with simultaneity (unique to Transactional).

**Teaching tip:** Use conversation analogy: In real dialogue, you're constantly reading facial expressions and adjusting while speaking (simultaneous), not waiting your turn to react (linear).

### Question 3: Audience Analysis
**When building credibility with a new audience (Week 1), which component of Aristotle's ethos is most important to establish first?**

A) Goodwill (showing you care about audience's interests) ← **CORRECT**
B) Competence (demonstrating expertise)
C) Character (showing integrity and values alignment)
D) All three are equally important and must be established simultaneously

**Why A is correct:**
Research from Hallenbeck & Childs (2022) cited in Week 1 shows that audiences first assess whether you have their interests at heart (goodwill) before they're receptive to your expertise (competence) or values (character). "Do you care about me?" precedes "Can you help me?"

**Why wrong:**
- B: Competence matters, but audiences won't listen to experts who don't show goodwill first
- C: Character is important for long-term trust but goodwill opens the door
- D: Research shows a sequence, not simultaneity - goodwill enables receptivity to competence and character

**Common confusion:** Students think expertise (competence) is most important in business contexts. Clarify: Audiences must first believe you care about their needs before they'll value your expertise.

**Teaching tip:** Example: Doctor with amazing credentials but dismissive bedside manner loses patient trust. Goodwill (showing care) makes competence credible.

### Question 4: BLUF Technique
**What does BLUF stand for in professional email writing (Week 2)?**

A) Brief, Logical, Useful, Friendly
B) Bottom Line Up Front ← **CORRECT**
C) Business Language Usage Framework
D) Best Logical Understanding First

**Why B is correct:**
BLUF = Bottom Line Up Front is the military-derived technique taught in Week 2 (Sehgal, 2016). It means stating your main point, request, or conclusion in the first sentence before providing supporting details.

**Why wrong:**
- A, C, D: These are plausible-sounding acronyms but incorrect

**Common confusion:** Students understand the concept but forget the exact acronym.

**Teaching tip:** Reinforce the visual metaphor: "Bottom line" (conclusion/main point) goes "up front" (at the beginning), not buried at the end.

---

### Question 5: Email Best Practices
**According to Week 2 content on professional email writing, which subject line is most effective?**

A) "Update"
B) "Quick question"
C) "Meeting scheduled: Project X review, Friday 2 PM" ← **CORRECT**
D) "Important - please read"

**Why C is correct:**
Effective subject lines are specific, informative, and action-oriented (Week 2 lecture). Option C tells the recipient exactly what the email contains (meeting scheduled), what it's about (Project X review), and when (Friday 2 PM). No need to open email to understand purpose.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Too vague - doesn't indicate content or urgency
- B: Generic and doesn't specify the topic or purpose
- D: Creates false urgency without information; "please read" is redundant (all emails should be read)

**Common confusion:** Students think "Important" makes emails more likely to be read. Actually, specific information does.

**Teaching tip:** Ask: "If you received 50 emails, which subject line would help you prioritize and understand content without opening?" Answer: C.

### Question 6: Professional Writing Principles
**According to "The Science of Strong Business Writing" (Birchard, 2021, Week 2), what is the ideal average sentence length for business writing to optimize comprehension?**

A) 8-12 words
B) 14-18 words ← **CORRECT**
C) 22-25 words
D) 30+ words for complex ideas

**Why B is correct:**
Birchard's research found that 14-18 words per sentence optimizes comprehension for business readers. Shorter can feel choppy; longer increases cognitive load and reduces retention.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Too short - creates choppy, simplistic tone
- C: Starting to become difficult for readers to process
- D: Significantly reduces comprehension; readers lose track of subject and verb

**Common confusion:** Students think longer sentences sound more professional or sophisticated.

**Teaching tip:** Show example: "Our quarterly results exceeded expectations and we will implement the expansion plan" (12 words, clear) vs. "Our quarterly results, which were released last week after extensive analysis by the finance team and review by the executive committee, exceeded the expectations that had been set at the beginning of the fiscal year" (37 words, exhausting).

### Question 7: Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion
**Which of Cialdini's 6 principles relies on people's desire to be consistent with their past commitments and stated positions (Week 3)?**

A) Reciprocity
B) Commitment and Consistency ← **CORRECT**
C) Social Proof
D) Authority

**Why B is correct:**
Commitment and Consistency principle (Cialdini, 2001, 2013 from Week 3) states that people feel internal pressure to behave consistently with their prior commitments, especially public ones. Once someone takes a position, they're motivated to stick with it.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Reciprocity is about returning favors, not maintaining consistency
- C: Social Proof is following what others do, not maintaining one's own consistency
- D: Authority is following expert guidance, not being consistent

**Common confusion:** Students sometimes confuse Commitment/Consistency with Social Proof (both involve behavioral pressure).

**Teaching tip:** Example: After someone agrees to a small request ("Will you sign this petition?"), they're more likely to agree to larger related request later ("Will you volunteer for this cause?") because they've already committed to the position.

### Question 8: Cialdini's Principles - Reciprocity
**The principle of Reciprocity (Cialdini, Week 3) suggests that people feel obligated to:**

A) Follow the behavior of others in their social group
B) Obey instructions from authority figures
C) Return favors and concessions ← **CORRECT**
D) Remain consistent with their previous statements

**Why C is correct:**
Reciprocity principle states that people feel obligated to give back to others who have given to them first. If you do someone a favor, they feel indebted to return the favor (Cialdini, 2001, Week 3).

**Why wrong:**
- A: This describes Social Proof, not Reciprocity
- B: This describes Authority, not Reciprocity
- D: This describes Commitment and Consistency, not Reciprocity

**Common confusion:** Students mix up the six principles. Use mnemonic or clear examples for each.

**Teaching tip:** Example: Free samples at supermarket create reciprocity obligation - after trying free sample, people feel they should buy the product even if they didn't need it before.

### Question 9: Persuasive Message Structure
**According to Week 3 content, what is the recommended structure for persuasive business proposals?**

A) Solution → Problem → Benefit
B) Problem → Solution → Benefit ← **CORRECT**
C) Benefit → Problem → Solution
D) Problem → Benefit → Solution

**Why B is correct:**
The Problem-Solution-Benefit structure (Week 3 lecture) follows logical persuasive flow: First establish the problem (creates need), then present your solution (shows how you address need), then emphasize benefits (motivates action). This aligns with know-feel-do framework.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Leading with solution before establishing problem makes audience wonder why they need it
- C: Benefits without problem context lack impact; audience doesn't understand relevance
- D: Benefits before solution is illogical - can't show benefits of unknown solution

**Common confusion:** Students sometimes think starting with benefits grabs attention best. Actually, establishing problem creates receptivity to solution and benefits.

**Teaching tip:** Use example: Sales pitch for security system. Problem: "Break-ins increased 40% in this neighborhood." Solution: "Our system monitors 24/7 with instant alerts." Benefit: "You sleep peacefully knowing your family is protected." Logical and persuasive.

### Question 10: Overcoming Objections
**When addressing potential objections in persuasive communication (Week 3), what is the recommended approach?**

A) Ignore objections and focus only on positive aspects
B) Acknowledge objections directly and provide counterarguments ← **CORRECT**
C) Discredit anyone who raises objections
D) Save objection discussion for Q&A session only

**Why B is correct:**
Week 3 lecture emphasized that effective persuaders acknowledge potential objections proactively and provide thoughtful counterarguments. This builds credibility (you're being honest) and prevents objections from derailing your message later.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Ignoring objections makes you seem naive or dishonest; audience will think of them anyway
- C: Discrediting people who raise valid concerns destroys trust and credibility
- D: Waiting for Q&A means objections fester during presentation and reduce persuasive impact

**Common confusion:** Students worry that raising objections gives ammunition to skeptics. Actually, addressing objections preemptively shows thorough thinking and builds trust.

**Teaching tip:** Example: Proposing expensive new software. Acknowledge objection: "I know the upfront cost seems high, but let me show you ROI analysis demonstrating 6-month payback period through efficiency gains..." This is more persuasive than ignoring the cost concern.

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

The cross-cultural scenario analysis activity is deliberately open-ended with multiple valid approaches. The TechVN x InnovateTech scenario mirrors real challenges Vietnamese professionals face when working with low-context, low power distance Western clients. Students need to synthesize multiple frameworks (Hofstede, Meyer, Brett et al.) and make strategic choices about which cultural gaps to bridge first and how.

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- **Uses specific cultural dimensions:** References exact Hofstede scores (Vietnam power distance 70 vs. Germany 35) or Meyer's dimensions (high-context vs. low-context) to justify protocol choices
- **Balances both cultures:** Doesn't force Vietnamese team to fully adapt to German norms OR vice versa; finds creative middle ground that honors both
- **Explicit and actionable:** Protocols are specific enough to implement (e.g., "Share meeting agenda 24 hours in advance with context document attached" vs. vague "communicate well")
- **Addresses multiple dimensions:** Tackles communication style, power distance, time orientation, trust-building, feedback norms (not just one)
- **Applies Brett et al. strategies:** Explicitly uses adaptation, structural intervention, or managerial intervention approaches with rationale

**Critical Moments:**

**During Pair Work (25 minutes):**

Circulate among pairs and listen for the following patterns. Around the 10-minute mark, many pairs will have outlined basic categories (meetings, feedback, deadlines) but may struggle with specificity or cultural justification. Useful prompts for struggling pairs: "Which specific cultural dimension causes friction in this area?" or "How does your protocol honor BOTH German and Vietnamese cultural needs?" Watch for pairs who simply list German norms without Vietnamese accommodation - gently redirect: "How might Vietnamese team members experience this protocol? What cultural needs aren't being met?" Strong pairs will reference specific lecture frameworks (e.g., "We're using managerial intervention approach from Brett et al. by setting explicit norms upfront"). Highlight these examples during debrief. Vietnamese students may be hesitant to assert Vietnamese cultural needs equally with German ones (collectivism and power distance at play) - encourage them: "Your Vietnamese cultural values are equally valid; the protocol should bridge, not erase differences."

**During Peer Review (10 minutes):**

Students should be comparing approaches, not finding "errors" (emphasize this). Different protocols work depending on team priorities - some may prioritize efficiency (lean toward German norms), others prioritize relationship quality (lean toward Vietnamese norms). Both can be valid IF justified by cultural analysis. Listen for peer review conversations that become too critical or judgmental - remind class: "We're exploring different strategies for bridging cultures, not identifying right/wrong answers." Encourage peers to identify trade-offs: "Your protocol prioritizes quick decisions (German preference) - what might be the cost in terms of relationship-building (Vietnamese preference)?" Best peer reviews will reference specific cultural dimensions: "You addressed high-context vs. low-context well in written communication norms, but I don't see how you're handling power distance differences in decision-making."

**During Revision & Debrief (5 minutes):**

Give pairs 3 minutes to revise based on feedback. Then highlight 2-3 strong protocols from different pairs (ask permission first): "This pair effectively bridged high-context and low-context by requiring both agenda bullets (German preference for directness) AND contextual background document (Vietnamese preference for relationship and context)." Point out creative solutions: "This pair suggested rotating who speaks first in meetings to prevent hierarchy bias - that's structural intervention addressing power distance." Connect student work to real cross-cultural business practices: "These protocols are exactly what multinational companies create when forming global teams - you're developing professional-level cultural intelligence." If time permits, discuss What would happen if protocol only accommodated one culture: German-only norms would alienate Vietnamese team and lose their cultural strengths (relationship networks, holistic thinking); Vietnamese-only norms would frustrate German team with perceived inefficiency and indirectness. Bridge = leverage strengths of both.

**Timing Flexibility:**

If Quiz 1 runs shorter than 30 minutes (some students finish quickly), you can extend the main activity to 45-50 minutes total, giving pairs more time to develop detailed protocols. If quiz runs full 30 minutes or longer, keep main activity to 40 minutes and streamline peer review (8 minutes) and debrief (3 minutes). The protocol development is the highest-value learning activity, so prioritize pair work time over extended debrief if needed. If you're running short on time at the end, the wrap-up section (portfolio preparation) can be assigned as homework reflection rather than in-class discussion - students have the self-assessment questions in their tutorial handout.
