**Course:** Business Communication (BCI2AU)
**Topic:** Strategic Communication Foundations
**Duration:** 90 minutes

---

## OPENING: Review & Assessment Preview (10 minutes)

### Quick Review: Three Key Concepts from Lecture

**1. Communication Models**
- Shannon-Weaver: One-way transmission (sender → message → receiver)
- Transactional Model: Two-way, simultaneous exchange with continuous feedback
- Key insight: Most business communication is transactional - you're adjusting based on feedback

**2. Know-Feel-Do Framework**
- Strategic message planning tool - answer three questions before writing:
  - **KNOW:** What should your audience learn/understand?
  - **FEEL:** What emotion or attitude should they have?
  - **DO:** What specific action should they take?
- Prevents the #1 mistake: communicating without clear purpose

**3. Building Credibility and Trust**
- Three components (Hallenbeck & Childs, 2022):
  - **Competence:** Do you know what you're talking about?
  - **Care:** Do you have the audience's best interests at heart?
  - **Connection:** Do you understand their perspective and context?
- 87% of employees say they need to trust leaders to do their best work

### What We're Preparing For

**Written Portfolio (Due Week 5) - 30% of your grade**

This portfolio includes:
- Email Series (2 emails) - 10%
- Persuasive Proposal - 10%
- Crisis Communication Response - 10%

**Today's tutorial practices:**
- Strategic message planning using know-feel-do framework
- Adapting communication for specific audiences
- Building credibility in written messages

**Simplified Rubric for Today** (3 key areas from full Written Communication Rubric):

1. **Content & Strategy:** Does the message apply know-feel-do framework? Is it aligned with audience needs and communication goals?
2. **Clarity & Concision:** Is the message clear and concise? Does every word serve a purpose?
3. **Audience Adaptation:** Is the message tailored to the specific audience's needs, preferences, and context?

## MAIN ACTIVITY: Strategic Message Planning (55-60 minutes)

### The Scenario

You work for **Viettel**, Vietnam's largest telecommunications company. Viettel is launching a new AI-powered customer service chatbot to handle routine inquiries (bill payments, service activation, basic troubleshooting). The chatbot will reduce wait times from 15 minutes to under 1 minute for these common requests.

**However:** This means reassigning 50 customer service representatives to new roles. Some will move to complex problem-solving teams (requiring training), others to sales teams. No one will lose their job, but roles will change significantly.

**Your task:** Plan strategic communication for **two different audiences** about this change. You'll create know-feel-do plans for both, then draft ONE message to practice.

**Note:** There are multiple valid strategic approaches to this scenario - your reasoning and audience adaptation matter most.

---

### The Data

**About the Change:**
- Timeline: Chatbot launches in 6 weeks
- Training programs start in 2 weeks (3-week duration)
- All employees keep their jobs but change roles
- New roles offer similar pay, some with growth opportunities
- Change is mandatory (not optional)

**Audience 1: Customer Service Representatives (CSRs)**
- 50 people affected, ages 25-45
- Average tenure: 5 years with Viettel
- Concerns: Job security, ability to learn new skills, loss of comfortable routine
- Values: Stability, clear expectations, support during transitions
- Communication preference: Direct, honest, with concrete next steps

**Audience 2: Viettel Customers**
- 30 million active customers
- Use customer service for: bill questions (40%), service activation (30%), troubleshooting (20%), other (10%)
- Concerns: Service quality, losing human touch, chatbot limitations
- Values: Fast service, problem resolution, feeling heard
- Communication preference: Benefits-focused, reassurance about support

---

### Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:** Complete the strategic planning template below for BOTH audiences, then draft ONE message (your choice of audience).

**Strategic Planning Template:**

```
AUDIENCE 1: Customer Service Representatives

KNOW (What should they learn/understand?):
[Fill in: Key information they need to know]

FEEL (What emotion/attitude should they have?):
[Fill in: Ideal emotional response - e.g., reassured, motivated, supported]

DO (What specific action should they take?):
[Fill in: Concrete next step with deadline]

CREDIBILITY STRATEGY (How will you build trust?):
Competence: [How you'll show you understand their concerns]
Care: [How you'll demonstrate their wellbeing matters]
Connection: [How you'll show you understand their perspective]
```

```
AUDIENCE 2: Viettel Customers

KNOW (What should they learn/understand?):
[Fill in: Key information they need to know]

FEEL (What emotion/attitude should they have?):
[Fill in: Ideal emotional response]

DO (What specific action should they take?):
[Fill in: Concrete next step, if any]

CREDIBILITY STRATEGY (How will you build trust?):
Competence: [Evidence chatbot will work well]
Care: [How you'll show customer experience is priority]
Connection: [How you'll address common customer concerns]
```

**Then, draft ONE message (200-250 words):**
- Choose either CSRs or customers
- Email format (include: To, From, Subject, Body)
- Apply your know-feel-do plan
- Aim for clarity, concision, and credibility

**Considerations:**
- For CSRs: Balance honesty about change with reassurance about support - Vietnamese workplace values may make this transition feel particularly disruptive
- For customers: Emphasize benefits while acknowledging chatbot limitations
- Both: Think about BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) - lead with key message
- Remember: Multiple approaches can work - defend your strategic choices

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**Exchange your strategic plan and drafted message with another pair/individual.**

**Review using these criteria:**

**1. Know-Feel-Do Application:**
- [ ] Is there a clear KNOW (information provided)?
- [ ] Is there an intentional FEEL (emotional goal)?
- [ ] Is there a specific DO (concrete action)?
- [ ] Do all three align with the audience?

**2. Audience Adaptation:**
- [ ] Does the message address the specific audience's concerns?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for this audience?
- [ ] Are examples/details relevant to their context?

**3. Clarity & Credibility:**
- [ ] Is the main message clear within first 2 sentences (BLUF)?
- [ ] Does the message build trust (competence, care, connection)?
- [ ] Is the language concise (no unnecessary words)?

**Provide feedback:**
- **One specific strength:** "Your know-feel-do plan for CSRs is strong because..."
- **One area to strengthen:** "To improve audience adaptation, consider..."

**Remember:** You're comparing approaches, not finding errors. Different strategies can be equally effective if well-reasoned.

---

### Revision & Debrief (15 minutes)

**Revision (10 min):**
Based on peer feedback, strengthen one aspect of your message. Focus on:
- Clarifying your know-feel-do alignment
- Sharpening audience adaptation
- Improving credibility signals

You don't need to change your overall approach - strengthen your reasoning and execution.

**Debrief (5 min):**
Class discussion comparing strategic approaches:
- What different "FEEL" goals did people choose for CSRs? (reassured vs. motivated vs. excited)
- How did credibility strategies differ for CSRs vs. customers?
- What did you learn about audience adaptation?
