## Quiz Solutions

### Question 1: Communication Models
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Shannon-Weaver defines "noise" as anything that interferes with message transmission - physical (loud environment), semantic (confusing language), or psychological (preconceptions). This is explicitly covered in Slide 7 of the lecture where noise is defined as interference with accurate message reception.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Too narrow - noise isn't just volume, it includes semantic and psychological interference
- C: Feedback is a separate element in the model, not noise
- D: Environment can cause noise but isn't the definition of noise itself

**Common confusion:** Students think "noise" is literally sound. Emphasize it's metaphorical - anything disrupting the message.

**Teaching tip:** Ask for examples of "semantic noise" (jargon confusing the receiver) vs. "physical noise" (construction sounds) to solidify understanding.

### Question 2: Communication Models
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
The key distinction covered in Slides 7-8 is that Shannon-Weaver treats communication as linear/one-way (sender → message → receiver), while Transactional shows both parties as simultaneous senders and receivers, continuously exchanging feedback. This is fundamental to understanding why most business communication is transactional.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Both models apply to written and verbal communication
- C: Reversed - Shannon-Weaver (1948) is older; Transactional is the modern improvement
- D: Opposite - Shannon-Weaver originally didn't emphasize feedback; Transactional is built on continuous feedback

**Common confusion:** Students mix up which model is newer and which includes feedback.

**Teaching tip:** Use analogy: Shannon-Weaver = email (send and wait), Transactional = conversation (continuous back-and-forth).

### Question 3: Strategic Message Design
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Slide 11 explicitly defines FEEL as "What emotion or attitude should your audience have after receiving your message?" This is the strategic emotional goal you're trying to achieve (reassured, motivated, excited, etc.).

**Why wrong:**
- A: FEEL is about audience emotion, not sender emotion
- C: Not about physical sensation - about emotional response
- D: Feedback is separate from know-feel-do planning

**Common confusion:** Students think FEEL is touchy-feely and optional. Emphasize it's strategic - every message creates an emotional response, intentional or not.

**Teaching tip:** Give example: Announcing layoffs. You want employees to FEEL: sad but reassured about support (not panicked or betrayed). Strategic choice matters.

### Question 4: Strategic Message Design
**Correct: A**

**Why A is correct:**
Slide 12 emphasizes that DO provides the concrete action the audience should take - making the message actionable. Without DO, audiences may understand (KNOW) and feel appropriately (FEEL) but not know what to do next. This is the "so what?" that drives business results.

**Why wrong:**
- B: DO doesn't make messages longer - it makes them actionable and focused
- C: DO focuses on audience action, not demonstrating sender expertise
- D: All three components (KNOW, FEEL, DO) are necessary - DO doesn't replace the others

**Common confusion:** Students think DO is optional for informational messages.

**Teaching tip:** Show that even "FYI" emails have an implicit DO - "file this information for later" or "be aware when making decisions." Make it explicit.

---

### Question 5: Audience Analysis
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Slide 16 defines primary audience as "the decision-maker who will act on your message" - the person with power to approve, implement, or decide based on your communication. This is who you're ultimately trying to persuade or inform for action.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Size doesn't determine primary status - a single CEO can be primary audience even if 100 people cc'd
- B: First recipient might be a gatekeeper, not the decision-maker
- D: The requester might not be the person who acts on the message

**Common confusion:** Students think primary = largest group or first recipient.

**Teaching tip:** Ask: "If you're proposing budget increase, is primary audience your manager (who reviews) or CFO (who approves)?" Answer: CFO, even if manager reads first.

---

### Question 6: Audience Analysis
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Slide 18 illustrates audience adaptation principle: technical team cares about implementation details (how to migrate data), product manager cares about user benefits (faster login), CEO cares about business impact (no budget impact, improved customer experience). Same content, different emphasis based on what each audience values.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Condescending assumption - CEOs understand technology but care about different aspects (business impact vs. technical implementation)
- C: Length isn't the main factor - focus and priorities differ
- D: Partially true but misses strategic point - it's not just detail level, it's what benefits you emphasize

**Common confusion:** Students think adaptation means "dumbing down" for non-technical audiences.

**Teaching tip:** Reframe as "emphasizing what matters to them" - all audiences are intelligent, but they have different priorities and decision criteria.

---

### Question 7: Credibility & Trust
**Correct: A**

**Why A is correct:**
Slide 21 explicitly presents Hallenbeck & Childs (2022) three components of credibility: **Competence** (do you know what you're talking about?), **Care** (do you have audience's best interests at heart?), **Connection** (do you understand their perspective?). This framework is from required reading and is testable.

**Why wrong:**
- B: These are writing principles (8 S's mentioned earlier), not credibility components
- C: This is the know-feel-do framework, not credibility components
- D: These are crisis communication principles, not general credibility model

**Common confusion:** Students mix up different frameworks taught in same week.

**Teaching tip:** Alliteration helps memory - "Three C's of Credibility: Competence, Care, Connection." Have students repeat it.

---

### Question 8: Credibility & Trust
**Correct: D**

**Why D is correct:**
Slide 20 (big number slide) states: "87% of employees say they need to trust business leaders to do their best work" citing Edelman Trust Barometer 2024. This specific statistic emphasizes the importance of trust in workplace communication.

**Why wrong:**
- A, B: Incorrect percentages
- C: This was the customer statistic (73% of customers won't buy from brands they don't trust), not employee statistic

**Common confusion:** Mixing up the two statistics from Slide 20 (87% employees, 73% customers).

**Teaching tip:** Remind: "Higher for employees (87%) than customers (73%) - trust matters even more internally than externally."

---

### Question 9: Applying Frameworks
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Strategic FEEL goals should support message purpose and organizational goals. For a potentially unpopular policy change, the goal is not to make employees happy about losing flexibility, but to have them feel reassured about the reasoning and supported during transition. This aligns with credibility (care) and reduces resistance to change.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Unproductive - anger doesn't lead to compliance or smooth transition
- B: Uncertainty undermines trust and increases resistance
- D: Confusion suggests poor communication, not strategic outcome

**Common confusion:** Students think FEEL must be positive emotion (happy, excited). Clarify: Sometimes FEEL is "sad but reassured" or "concerned but confident in leadership" - realistic emotions with constructive framing.

**Teaching tip:** Compare two approaches: FEEL = angry (destructive) vs. FEEL = disappointed but reassured with support (constructive). Both acknowledge negative news, but one builds trust.

---

### Question 10: Cultural Considerations
**Correct: A**

**Why A is correct:**
Slide 18 (Vietnamese context example) explains that Vietnamese business culture is "high-context" - meaning communication relies heavily on implicit messages, relationships, and shared cultural understanding rather than explicit, direct statements. This contrasts with "low-context" Western business culture that values direct, explicit communication.

**Why wrong:**
- B: High-context doesn't mean formal only - it means relying on implicit understanding and context
- C: Vietnamese businesses use extensive written communication
- D: Opposite - high-context cultures often prefer indirect, concise communication; low-context cultures prefer explicit detail

**Common confusion:** Students confuse "high-context" with "formal" or "indirect = vague."

**Teaching tip:** Explain: High-context = "reading between the lines matters" (relationships, hierarchy, implicit cues). Low-context = "say exactly what you mean" (explicit, direct, words carry full meaning). Neither is better - just different.

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

This activity is deliberately open-ended and mirrors real business scenarios where there's no single "right answer." Students are planning strategic communication for a workplace change (AI chatbot replacing routine customer service tasks). The scenario is designed to practice know-feel-do planning and audience adaptation before the high-stakes Written Portfolio (Week 5). The Viettel example provides Vietnamese cultural relevance and introduces challenges around job change in a culture that highly values stability.

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- **Clear know-feel-do alignment**: Each component (KNOW, FEEL, DO) is specific, intentional, and works together strategically
- **Thoughtful audience adaptation**: CSR and customer plans differ significantly, reflecting different concerns and priorities
- **Credibility strategy**: Concrete plans for demonstrating competence, care, and connection (not generic statements)
- **Strategic justification**: Students can explain why they chose specific FEEL goals and credibility approaches
- **BLUF application**: Drafted message leads with bottom line (key message) in first 1-2 sentences, then supports with details

**Critical Moments:**

**During Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes):** Around the 5-minute mark, check that students aren't rushing to draft the message without completing the strategic planning templates first. The templates are the foundation - the draft should flow from them. If you see pairs jumping straight to writing, redirect: "Have you completed both know-feel-do templates? The planning is more important than the draft." This reinforces that strategy precedes execution.

Around the 15-minute mark, circulate and spot-check credibility strategies. Many students will write vague statements like "show I care" or "be competent." Push for specificity: "How exactly will you demonstrate care? What specific words or evidence show competence?" Good examples: For CSRs - "Demonstrate care by announcing training dates NOW (not vague 'soon') so they can plan"; "Show competence by citing similar successful transitions at other telecom companies."

For Vietnamese students particularly, watch for discomfort with the CSR scenario (announcing role changes). This touches on cultural values around job stability and hierarchy. If students seem stuck, validate: "This is genuinely difficult - Vietnamese workplace culture values stability, and this announcement disrupts that. How might you honor that cultural value while still being direct about the change?" This gives permission to wrestle with the cultural tension rather than avoiding it.

**During Peer Review (15 minutes):** Some pairs will struggle with peer feedback, especially in Vietnamese educational context where direct critique of peers may feel inappropriate. Remind everyone at the start: "Today we're comparing strategic approaches, not grading each other's work. Your classmate might have chosen a different FEEL goal (motivated vs. reassured) - both can work. Ask: Does their approach align internally? Is it well-reasoned?" Emphasize that strong peer review identifies what's working and offers one specific suggestion.

Listen for surface-level feedback like "This is good" or "Add more detail." If you hear this, model deeper analysis: "I notice you chose FEEL = excited for CSRs. That's bold - most groups chose reassured. Can you walk me through why excited works better for your audience? What specific language creates excitement?" This teaches analytical peer review.

**During Revision & Debrief (15 minutes):** The revision period is short (10 min) - remind students they're not rewriting, just strengthening one element based on feedback. Some students will want to completely restart. Redirect: "You don't need to change your approach - strengthen your execution. If feedback was 'build more credibility,' add one specific sentence that demonstrates care or competence. Small, focused improvement."

The debrief should surface the variety of valid approaches. Ask: "How many chose FEEL = reassured for CSRs? How many chose motivated? How many chose excited?" Then pick one representative from each camp to explain their reasoning. Goal: Students see that "reassured" might prioritize reducing anxiety, "motivated" might emphasize growth opportunity, "excited" might target high performers - all defensible based on strategic assumptions. Celebrate the diversity and reinforce that real business communication requires judgment calls.

**Timing Flexibility:**

If the main activity is running long (students deeply engaged in planning and drafting), you have two options: (1) Shorten peer review to 10 minutes and revision to 5 minutes - still doable if you keep focus tight. (2) Assign quiz practice as homework and spend the full hour on the activity + debrief. Given this is Week 1, option 2 might be better - prioritize deep practice over quiz prep, especially since Quiz 1 isn't until Week 4. Use your judgment based on student engagement and energy level.
