Week 1: Strategic Communication Foundations

Andrews University - National Economics University Campus
Fall 2025

Instructor: William Winterton Lang

[PURPOSE: Introduce]
[TIMING: 1 minute]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome students to Business Communication
- This is Week 1 of 11-week course focused on strategic professional communication

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Today we're building the foundation for everything that follows in this course
- We'll move from basic "what is communication?" to "how do I communicate strategically for business results?"
- This isn't just about writing better emails - it's about using communication as a strategic tool

**Transition:**
- "Before we dive in, let's start with a question that reveals why this course matters..."

---

**SLIDE 2: Why Does This Matter?**

CONTENT:

**Consider this scenario:**

You've developed a brilliant solution to a major company problem. You have the data. You have the expertise. You have the plan.

**But...**

Your proposal is rejected. Your presentation falls flat. Your email gets ignored.

**The problem?** Not your idea. Your communication.

**Research shows:** 67% of failed initiatives fail not because of bad ideas, but because of poor communication (PMI, 2013).

*Project Management Institute. (2013). The high cost of low performance: The essential role of communications. PMI Pulse of the Profession.*

[PURPOSE: Hook]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Start with validation: "How many of you have had a great idea that didn't get traction?" [Show of hands]
- This creates immediate relevance - everyone has experienced this

**Key Teaching Points:**
- The gap between good ideas and successful outcomes is often communication
- Technical skills get you in the door; communication skills determine how far you go
- This statistic (67%) comes from major PM study across 10,000+ projects

**Cultural Context:**
- Vietnamese students often excel at technical skills but may undervalue communication training
- Frame this as the differentiator that makes technical expertise visible and valued

**Transition:**
- "This course is about closing that gap. Let's start by learning the vocabulary we'll use all semester..."

---

**SLIDE 3: Key Vocabulary**

CONTENT:

| **English Term** | **Vietnamese** | **Definition** |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Strategic Communication** | Truyền thông chiến lược | Goal-oriented communication designed to achieve specific business outcomes |
| **Stakeholder** | Bên liên quan | Any person or group affected by or able to influence a business decision |
| **Know-Feel-Do** | Biết-Cảm-Hành động | Framework for planning what audience should know, feel, and do after your message |
| **Credibility** | Độ tin cậy | The quality of being trusted and believed in |
| **Audience Analysis** | Phân tích đối tượng | Systematic process of understanding your audience's needs, preferences, and context |

[PURPOSE: Prime vocabulary]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These five terms are the foundation of strategic business communication"
- Encourage students to write these down or photograph the slide

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Strategic communication is NOT just "good communication" - it's purposeful and goal-driven
- Stakeholders go beyond customers - includes employees, investors, partners, regulators, community
- Know-Feel-Do framework is our primary planning tool - we'll use it throughout the course

**Cultural Context:**
- Vietnamese translations help ESL students connect English business terms to concepts they may know
- Pronunciation note: "Stakeholder" is often mispronounced - emphasize "STAKE-holder" not "stick-holder"

**Examples:**
- Strategic communication example: FPT announcing expansion to new markets (carefully planned messaging to multiple stakeholders)
- Stakeholder example: VinFast launching electric vehicles (had to communicate to investors, government, customers, employees simultaneously)

**Transition:**
- "Now that we have our vocabulary, let's look at what you'll be able to do by the end of this week..."

---

---

## CORE CONTENT (Slides 6-23)

---

**SLIDE 6: Part 1: Communication Models**

CONTENT:

**Understanding How Communication Works**

[PURPOSE: Section break]
[TIMING: 30 seconds]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Section Break - Transition:**
- "We're moving into Part 1: Communication Models"
- "Before we can communicate strategically, we need to understand HOW communication actually works"

**Frame This Section:**
- We'll look at two models: Shannon-Weaver (foundational) and Transactional (modern)
- These aren't just academic theory - understanding these helps you diagnose communication breakdowns

**What's Coming:**
- Next 3-4 slides cover communication models
- Then we'll transition to strategic message design (know-feel-do framework)

---

**SLIDE 7: The Shannon-Weaver Model (1948)**

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**The foundational communication model:**

**Sender → Encoder → Channel → Decoder → Receiver**

**With:** Noise (anything that interferes with message)

**Key insight:** Communication is information transfer from point A to point B.

**Business application:**
- Sender: You
- Message: Your email/presentation/proposal
- Channel: Email, meeting, Slack, report
- Noise: Distractions, technical jargon, cultural differences, poor timing
- Receiver: Your boss, client, team

**Limitation:** Treats communication as one-way transmission (we'll improve on this next).

*Shannon, C. E., & Weaver, W. (1949). The mathematical theory of communication. University of Illinois Press.*

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This 1948 model was originally designed for telephone systems at Bell Labs"
- "But it's still useful for understanding communication breakdowns"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Draw the linear model on board: Sender → Message → Receiver
- Emphasize NOISE - this is why communication fails
- Examples of noise: Technical jargon when audience doesn't have technical background; email sent at 11 PM when people are off; cultural assumptions that don't translate

**Vietnamese Context Example:**
- Vietnamese company communicating with international partners - noise includes time zones, language barriers, business culture differences (high-context vs. low-context)

**Common Misconception:**
- Students think if they send a clear message, communication succeeded
- Clarify: Shannon-Weaver shows communication can fail at any point (encoding, channel, decoding)

**Teaching Tip:**
- Ask: "What's an example of 'noise' you've experienced in business communication?"
- Take 1-2 responses, validate all answers

**Transition:**
- "Shannon-Weaver helps us understand failures, but it's missing something critical - what happens AFTER the receiver gets the message?"

---

**SLIDE 8: The Transactional Model (Modern)**

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Communication as ongoing exchange:**

**Person A ↔ Feedback ↔ Person B**

**(Both are simultaneously senders AND receivers)**

**Key insight:** Communication is not one-way transmission - it's dynamic, continuous exchange.

**What this adds:**
- **Feedback loops:** Receiver responds, sender adjusts
- **Simultaneous roles:** Everyone sends and receives at same time (body language, tone, reactions)
- **Context matters:** Physical, cultural, organizational setting shapes meaning
- **Relationship:** Communication builds or damages relationships over time

**Business application:** Your presentation isn't just you delivering information - it's reading the room, adjusting based on reactions, Q&A, building rapport.

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The Transactional Model corrects Shannon-Weaver's main limitation"
- "Real communication isn't Speaker → Audience. It's continuous back-and-forth."

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Draw circular arrows on board showing simultaneous exchange
- Emphasize FEEDBACK - this is what makes communication strategic
- In meetings/presentations, you're reading body language, adjusting pace, responding to confusion

**Concrete Example:**
- You're presenting a proposal to your boss
- Boss looks confused → You notice → You clarify or give example → Boss nods → You continue
- This is transactional - you're both sending and receiving simultaneously

**Vietnamese Cultural Context:**
- Vietnamese communication tends to be high-context (lots of implicit feedback through non-verbal cues)
- Recognizing subtle feedback (facial expressions, silence, group dynamics) is communication skill Vietnamese students often already have
- Frame this as strength: "You're already skilled at reading implicit feedback - transactional model explains why that matters"

**Comparison:**
- Shannon-Weaver: Email (one-way, no immediate feedback)
- Transactional: Meeting (continuous feedback, adjustment)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can someone give me an example of transactional communication from your daily life?"
- Expected answer: Conversations with friends, group projects, negotiations

**Transition:**
- "Now that we understand HOW communication works, let's talk about making it STRATEGIC..."

**SLIDE 9: Part 2: Strategic Message Design**

CONTENT:

**The Know-Feel-Do Framework**

[PURPOSE: Section break]
[TIMING: 30 seconds]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Section Break - Transition:**
- "We're moving from 'how communication works' to 'how to make it work for business goals'"
- "This next section is the most practical framework you'll learn this week - you'll use it in every assignment"

**Frame This Section:**
- Know-Feel-Do framework is your strategic planning tool
- Before writing any business message, answer three questions: What should audience KNOW, FEEL, DO?
- This prevents the #1 mistake: communicating without clear purpose

**What's Coming:**
- Next 3 slides break down each element (Know, Feel, Do)
- Then we'll see application examples

**Timing Note:**
- We're about 20 minutes into lecture - perfect time for most impactful framework

---

**SLIDE 10: The Know-Feel-Do Framework**

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Strategic message planning in three questions:**

**1. What should my audience KNOW?**
(Information, facts, context)

**2. What should my audience FEEL?**
(Emotional response, attitude)

**3. What should my audience DO?**
(Specific action, behavior change)

**Why this matters:** Most failed business communication lacks clarity on one of these three elements. Strategic communicators design messages with all three in mind.

**Application:** Before writing any email, proposal, or presentation, write one sentence for each: "After this message, my audience should KNOW [X], FEEL [Y], and DO [Z]."

*Hallinen, A., & Salipante, T. (2005). The strategic communication imperative. MIT Sloan Management Review, 46(3), 83-89.*

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This framework comes from MIT Sloan research on strategic communication (Hallinen & Salipante, 2005)"
- "It's simple but incredibly powerful - it forces you to clarify your purpose BEFORE you communicate"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- KNOW = Cognitive (what information they need)
- FEEL = Affective (what emotional response you want)
- DO = Behavioral (what action you want them to take)
- Most emails fail because writer is clear on KNOW but vague on FEEL and DO

**Concrete Example:**
- BAD email: "Here's the Q3 report" (KNOW only - what should they do with it?)
- GOOD email using framework:
  - KNOW: Q3 revenue down 12% due to delayed product launch
  - FEEL: Concerned but confident we can recover
  - DO: Approve budget for accelerated Q4 marketing campaign

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Write K-F-D on board
- Ask students: "Think of an email you sent recently - did it have all three elements?"
- This creates self-awareness of their current habits

**Common Mistake:**
- Students list multiple things for each (e.g., "I want them to KNOW a, b, c, d, e...")
- Push back: "If you have 5 things in KNOW, your message lacks focus. Pick the ONE most important thing."

**Connection to Portfolio:**
- Email Series assignment (Week 5) requires explicit K-F-D statement for each email
- Persuasive Proposal requires all three elements clearly present

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down each element starting with KNOW..."

---

**SLIDE 11: Know: What Should Your Audience Learn?**

CONTENT:

**KNOW = Information your audience needs**

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the single most important thing they need to understand?
- What context or background do they need?
- What facts, data, or evidence support your message?

**Common mistakes:**
- Assuming they already know context (they don't)
- Providing too much information (cognitive overload)
- Burying the main point in details

**Best practice: Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)**
Lead with your main point, THEN provide supporting details.

**Example:**
- ❌ Weak KNOW: "I want them to understand the project status"
- ✓ Strong KNOW: "I want them to know the project is delayed 2 weeks due to vendor issues, but we're implementing a mitigation plan"

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "KNOW is usually the easiest element for technical professionals - you're good at information"
- "But even here, most people make predictable mistakes"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) is military communication technique - we'll cover this more in Week 2
- For KNOW, less is more - one clear point beats five vague points
- The "curse of knowledge" - we assume others have context we have

**Concrete Example:**
- Engineer emailing manager about system outage
- BAD KNOW: "The server experienced a critical failure" (what does that mean? what should I do?)
- GOOD KNOW: "The payment system is down for 2 hours; customers can't check out. We're implementing backup and expect restoration by 2 PM."

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Vietnamese business culture values relationship and context
- Don't skip context-setting even though it feels slow
- Western business communication favors directness (BLUF), which may feel abrupt initially

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Ask: "What's more important - being comprehensive or being clear?"
- Answer: Clear. Comprehensive can come in follow-up.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can someone rewrite this KNOW statement to be stronger: 'I want them to understand the budget situation'"
- Expected answer: "I want them to know we're 15% over budget on Q3 marketing and need approval for reallocation from Q4"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's talk about the element most people forget: FEEL..."

---

**SLIDE 12: Feel: What Emotional Response Do You Want?**

CONTENT:

**FEEL = Emotional and attitudinal response**

**Questions to ask:**
- How should they feel after reading/hearing this?
- What attitude do you want them to have toward your message?
- What emotions would help or hinder your goal?

**Why this matters:**
Emotion drives decision-making more than logic. Research shows decisions are made emotionally and justified rationally (Damasio, 1994).

**Examples:**
- Persuasive proposal: Want them to feel excited about opportunity, confident in your ability
- Crisis communication: Want them to feel concerned but reassured, informed not panicked
- Status update: Want them to feel confident progress is happening

**Cultural note:** Different cultures have different norms for expressing emotion in business. Know your audience.

*Damasio, A. R. (1994). Descartes' error: Emotion, reason, and the human brain. Putnam.*

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "FEEL is the element most business communicators skip entirely"
- "They think business is about facts and logic. But research shows emotion drives decisions."

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Damasio's research shows people with damaged emotional centers can't make decisions even with perfect information
- You can't eliminate emotion from business communication - you can only manage it strategically
- FEEL doesn't mean manipulating emotions - it means being intentional about emotional impact

**Concrete Examples:**
- Requesting budget approval: Want them to FEEL excited about ROI potential, confident in your plan
- Delivering bad news: Want them to FEEL informed and prepared, not blindsided
- Motivating team: Want them to FEEL valued and energized, not pressured

**Vietnamese Cultural Context:**
- Vietnamese business culture values harmony and face-saving
- Negative emotions (anger, frustration) are less acceptable in professional settings than in Western cultures
- Consider this when planning FEEL - aim for positive or neutral emotions even when delivering problems

**Common Mistake:**
- Students say "I want them to feel happy" - too vague
- Push for specificity: "I want them to feel excited about the market opportunity and confident in our execution ability"

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Show contrast: Same KNOW, different FEEL changes the message
- Example: KNOW = "Project delayed 2 weeks"
  - FEEL option A: Concerned but assured (for manager)
  - FEEL option B: Apologetic but professional (for client)

**Connection:**
- Persuasive communication (Week 3) is all about managing FEEL
- Crisis communication (Week 6) requires careful FEEL management

**Transition:**
- "Finally, let's talk about the most important element: DO..."

---

**SLIDE 13: Do: What Action Do You Want?**

CONTENT:

**DO = Specific action or behavior**

**Questions to ask:**
- What exactly do you want them to do after this message?
- Is the action clear, specific, and achievable?
- Have you made it easy for them to take action?

**Make actions CLEAR:**
- ❌ Vague: "Please consider this proposal"
- ✓ Clear: "Please approve budget by Friday, March 15"

**Make actions EASY:**
- Provide links, attachments, next steps
- Remove barriers and friction
- Specify deadline if time-sensitive

**No action needed?** Still be explicit: "No action required - this is FYI only"

**Research shows:** Explicit calls to action increase response rates by 371% compared to implied actions (HubSpot, 2023).

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "DO is the payoff - this is why you're communicating"
- "Yet most business messages have vague or missing calls to action"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Specificity matters: "Review this" vs. "Approve this proposal by Friday COB"
- One DO is better than five - don't ask for too many actions
- Make it easy: Include link, attachment, deadline, format

**Concrete Example:**
- BAD DO: "Let me know your thoughts" (what thoughts? when? how?)
- GOOD DO: "Reply by Thursday with your approval or any questions about the budget allocation"

**Common Scenarios:**
- Status update where no action needed: Still say "No action required - keeping you informed"
- Request where multiple actions possible: Provide options "Reply with A, B, or C by Friday"

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Vietnamese business communication may use indirect requests ("Could you possibly consider...")
- International business expects direct: "Please approve by..."
- Practice being direct while remaining polite

**Research Note:**
- HubSpot analyzed millions of emails - explicit CTAs dramatically improve response
- This applies to business communication too, not just marketing

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's wrong with this DO: 'Please give me feedback on this proposal'"
- Expected answer: Too vague - when? what kind of feedback? approval or comments?

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Have students rewrite vague DOs from their own emails
- Examples: "Get back to me" → "Reply by Tuesday with approval or specific concerns"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's see this framework in action with an example..."

---

**SLIDE 14: Know-Feel-Do in Action**

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

**Vietnamese Example: FPT Software Expansion**

**Scenario:** FPT Software announcing expansion to new markets (Japan, US) to employees.

**KNOW:**
We're expanding to Japan and US markets starting Q1 2025, creating 200 new positions requiring English and Japanese language skills.

**FEEL:**
Excited about growth opportunities, proud of company achievement, motivated to develop language skills for new roles.

**DO:**
Complete language skill assessment survey by March 15 to be considered for new market positions.

**Result:** Clear, strategic message that informs, motivates, and drives specific action. Employees know exactly what this means for them and what to do next.

[PURPOSE: Apply]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Here's a real Vietnamese company example showing Know-Feel-Do in action"
- This dark slide highlights Vietnamese context (as recommended in course design)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- KNOW is concrete: What, when, what's in it for employees
- FEEL is motivational: Growth, opportunity, pride (positive emotions)
- DO is specific: Survey, deadline, why (to be considered for positions)
- This message alignment increases employee engagement and action

**Why This Works:**
- Employees aren't just informed (KNOW), they're motivated (FEEL) and know next step (DO)
- Compare to typical announcement: "FPT is expanding" (KNOW only - so what?)

**Cultural Insight:**
- FPT is Vietnam's largest software company, expanding globally
- This announcement balances company pride (important in Vietnamese culture) with practical action
- Language requirement is significant barrier - message acknowledges this by offering assessment/support

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Ask: "What would happen if FPT only included KNOW? No FEEL or DO?"
- Expected answer: Employees informed but not engaged or acting

**Connection to Assignments:**
- This is exactly what you'll do in Email Series (Week 5)
- You'll plan K-F-D for each email before writing

**Transition:**
- "Know-Feel-Do helps you plan strategic messages. But messages only work if you understand your audience..."

---

**SLIDE 15: Part 3: Audience Analysis**

CONTENT:

**Understanding Who You're Communicating With**

[PURPOSE: Section break]
[TIMING: 30 seconds]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Section Break - Transition:**
- "We've covered communication models and strategic message design"
- "Now we move to audience analysis - understanding WHO you're communicating with"

**Frame This Section:**
- You can have perfect message structure, but if you don't know your audience, you'll fail
- Audience analysis is systematic process of understanding needs, preferences, context
- We'll cover three aspects: stakeholder identification, audience needs, adapting messages

**What's Coming:**
- Next 3-4 slides on audience analysis fundamentals
- Then we move to final section on credibility and trust

**Timing Note:**
- We're about 45 minutes in - midpoint of lecture
- Good time for active learning question

**Transition:**
- "First question: Who is your audience? Seems obvious, but most people get this wrong..."

---

**SLIDE 16: Who Is Your Audience? (Stakeholder Mapping)**

CONTENT:

**Your audience is often multiple stakeholders with different needs.**

**Types of stakeholders:**
1. **Primary audience:** Decision-maker who will act on your message
2. **Secondary audience:** Influencers who advise primary audience
3. **Gatekeepers:** People who control access or approval
4. **Watchdog audience:** People monitoring for compliance, ethics, public interest

**Example: Proposing new marketing campaign**
- Primary: Marketing Director (approves budget)
- Secondary: CEO (influences big decisions), Finance team (reviews ROI)
- Gatekeeper: Director's assistant (schedules meeting)
- Watchdog: Legal team (ensures compliance), PR team (protects brand)

**Strategic implication:** You may need different messages for different stakeholder groups, even about same initiative.

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Biggest mistake in business communication: Assuming your audience is one person"
- "Most important messages have multiple stakeholders with different interests"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Primary audience has decision-making power - this is who you optimize for
- Secondary audiences can veto or influence even if they don't officially decide
- Gatekeepers control access - build relationship with them
- Watchdog audiences are often forgotten until they block your proposal

**Concrete Example:**
- Student wants approval for new club activity
- Primary: Dean of Students (approves activities)
- Secondary: Faculty advisor (recommends or opposes)
- Gatekeeper: Admin assistant (adds to Dean's agenda)
- Watchdog: Student Affairs office (monitors university policies)

**Vietnamese Context Example:**
- Proposing new process at Vietnamese company
- Primary: Department manager
- Secondary: Senior leadership, team members
- Gatekeeper: Manager's secretary
- Watchdog: HR (compliance), Finance (budget)
- Vietnamese business culture emphasizes hierarchy - understand who has real vs. formal authority

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Draw stakeholder map on board as concentric circles
- Center = Primary, next ring = Secondary, outer = Gatekeepers/Watchdogs
- Ask students to map stakeholders for their group presentation (Week 11)

**Common Misconception:**
- Students think if they convince primary audience, they're done
- Reality: Secondary/watchdog can derail even with primary support

**Check Understanding:**
- "For your Written Portfolio submission, who are the stakeholders?"
- Expected answer: Primary = instructor (grader), Secondary = teaching assistants (if applicable), Watchdog = university plagiarism detection

**Transition:**
- "Once you know WHO your stakeholders are, next question is: What do they care about?"

---

**SLIDE 17: What Does Your Audience Care About?**

CONTENT:

**Understand audience needs, priorities, and constraints:**

**Key questions for audience analysis:**
1. **What do they already know?** (Don't over-explain or under-explain)
2. **What do they care about?** (Their priorities, not yours)
3. **What are their constraints?** (Time, budget, authority, politics)
4. **What's their communication style?** (Data-driven? Story-driven? Brief? Detailed?)
5. **What cultural factors matter?** (Hierarchy, formality, directness, context)

**Example: Requesting budget approval**
- Finance Director cares about: ROI, risk mitigation, budget impact
- Marketing Director cares about: Customer acquisition, brand impact, competitive advantage
- CEO cares about: Strategic alignment, scalability, leadership implications

**Same proposal, different emphasis for each audience.**

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Most people communicate what THEY want to say instead of what AUDIENCE needs to hear"
- "Strategic communicators flip this - start with audience needs"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- These five questions are your pre-communication checklist
- Biggest mistake: Assuming audience has same priorities as you
- Technical people tend to emphasize technical excellence; business leaders care about business outcomes

**Concrete Example:**
- Engineer proposing new software tool
- To CTO: Emphasize technical superiority, security, scalability
- To CFO: Emphasize cost savings, productivity gains, ROI timeline
- Same tool, different communication for different audience priorities

**Vietnamese Cultural Factors:**
- Hierarchy: Senior leaders expect formal tone and respect
- High-context: Vietnamese audiences pick up on implicit messages
- Face-saving: Deliver criticism privately, praise publicly
- Harmony: Emphasize consensus and group benefit over individual wins

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Ask: "Think about your parents vs. your friends - do you communicate the same way?"
- Answer: No - different audience, different approach (they already know this intuitively)
- Point out: Business is the same - adapt to your audience

**Connection to Portfolio:**
- Email Series requires different audiences (supervisor, colleague, client)
- Each email needs different tone, level of formality, emphasis
- Persuasive Proposal requires understanding decision-maker's priorities

**Common Mistake:**
- Students write what they know, not what audience needs
- Example: Over-explaining concepts audience already understands (condescending) or under-explaining (confusing)

**Transition:**
- "Once you understand what audience cares about, you can adapt your message..."

---

**SLIDE 18: Adapting Your Message to Your Audience**

CONTENT:

**Adaptation strategies:**

**For Technical Audiences:**
- Use precise terminology, data, specifications
- Show your expertise through accuracy
- Provide deep detail

**For Executive Audiences:**
- Lead with bottom line (BLUF)
- Focus on strategic impact and business outcomes
- Be brief - executives have limited time

**For Cross-Cultural Audiences:**
- Research cultural communication norms
- Adjust formality, directness, relationship-building
- Seek local advice when unsure

**For Skeptical Audiences:**
- Acknowledge their concerns explicitly
- Provide strong evidence and credibility signals
- Use two-sided arguments (address counterarguments)

**Adaptation is not manipulation - it's respect for your audience's needs and context.**

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Adaptation means meeting your audience where they are"
- "It's not changing your message - it's changing how you deliver it"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Technical vs. executive is classic adaptation challenge
- Engineers often give executives too much detail; executives want summary and decision
- Cross-cultural requires research - don't assume

**Concrete Example:**
- Same project update, three audiences:
  1. Engineering team: "We resolved the API latency issue using caching and refactored the authentication middleware"
  2. Product Manager: "We fixed the speed problem and improved security - users will see faster login"
  3. CEO: "Customer experience improved, system more secure, no budget impact"

**Vietnamese Context Example:**
- Vietnamese business culture: High-context, relationship-oriented, hierarchy-conscious
- Western business culture: Low-context, task-oriented, equality-oriented
- When Vietnamese company communicates with US partners, need to be more explicit, direct, less hierarchical in tone

**Common Mistake:**
- Students think one version of message works for everyone
- Reality: Adaptation increases effectiveness dramatically

**Ethical Note:**
- Students worry adaptation = manipulation
- Clarify: Manipulation changes the truth; adaptation changes the packaging
- You're still being honest - just emphasizing what matters to each audience

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you're presenting to your professor vs. presenting to classmates, would you use the same style?"
- Expected answer: No - professor expects formality, evidence, structure; classmates expect relatability

**Transition:**
- "Final piece of strategic communication: Building credibility and trust..."

**SLIDE 20: Why Trust Matters**

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: big-number-slide -->

**87%**

of employees say they need to trust business leaders to do their best work.

**73%**

of customers won't buy from brands they don't trust.

**Trust is the currency of business communication.** Without it, even the best message fails.

*Edelman Trust Barometer. (2024). 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer Global Report. https://www.edelman.com/trust/2024/trust-barometer*

[PURPOSE: Persuade]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These numbers show why trust isn't soft skill - it's business critical"
- Edelman Trust Barometer is gold standard research (surveys 32,000+ people across 28 countries annually)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- 87% figure shows trust impacts performance (not just feelings)
- 73% figure shows trust impacts revenue (not just reputation)
- Trust is earned through consistent communication and action over time

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Vietnamese culture is relationship-based - trust is even more critical than in transaction-based Western cultures
- Vietnamese consumers especially value trust given history of product quality issues
- Brand trust takes years to build but can be destroyed overnight

**Concrete Example:**
- Vinamilk scandal 2008 (melamine contamination) destroyed consumer trust overnight
- Took years of transparent communication and quality improvement to rebuild
- Shows why crisis communication (Week 6) focuses heavily on trust restoration

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Ask: "Think of a brand or person you DON'T trust - would you buy from them or work with them?"
- Expected answer: No - validates that trust drives decisions

**Transition:**
- "So how do you BUILD trust? Research shows three components..."

---

**SLIDE 21: Three Components of Credibility**

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**According to Hallenbeck & Childs (2022), credibility has three dimensions:**

**1. Competence (Logic)**
"Do they know what they're talking about?"
- Expertise, experience, track record
- Data, evidence, reasoning

**2. Character (Authenticity)**
"Do they have good intentions?"
- Honesty, integrity, transparency
- Consistency between words and actions

**3. Connection (Empathy)**
"Do they understand and care about me?"
- Active listening, understanding needs
- Showing that you care about audience's success

**All three required:** Strong in 2 of 3 = weak credibility. Need all three.

*Hallenbeck, G., & Childs, P. (2022, March 9). To win over an audience, focus on building trust. Harvard Business Review. https://hbr.org/2022/03/to-win-over-an-audience-focus-on-building-trust*

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This framework from HBR research shows trust isn't one thing - it's three"
- "And you need all three. Strong in 2 out of 3 = still untrustworthy"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Competence** = head (logical trust)
- **Character** = heart (moral trust)
- **Connection** = empathy (emotional trust)
- Most professionals focus only on competence and wonder why they're not trusted

**Concrete Examples:**
- **High competence, low character:** Brilliant consultant who lies = no trust
- **High character, low competence:** Honest but incompetent advisor = no trust
- **High competence + character, low connection:** Expert who doesn't listen to your needs = weak trust

**Vietnamese Context Example:**
- Vietnamese business culture values relationships and character highly
- Competence alone insufficient - must demonstrate character through actions over time
- Connection built through relationship investment (shared meals, personal conversation, patience)
- This is why business in Vietnam takes time - building trust across all three dimensions

**Common Mistake:**
- Technical professionals over-index on competence (showing off expertise)
- Neglect character (being vulnerable and authentic) and connection (listening)
- Result: Seen as smart but not trusted

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Ask students to rate themselves on each dimension (1-10)
- Which is weakest? That's your development area
- Most students rate competence highest, connection lowest

**Application:**
- In presentations: Show competence (data), character (honesty about limitations), connection (address audience concerns)
- In persuasive proposals: All three dimensions required to persuade

**Transition:**
- "Let's see how to build each component practically..."

---

**SLIDE 22: Building Credibility in Business Communication**

CONTENT:

**Practical strategies for each dimension:**

**Build Competence:**
- ✓ Cite credible sources and research
- ✓ Use precise data and evidence
- ✓ Acknowledge what you don't know
- ✓ Demonstrate subject matter expertise

**Build Character:**
- ✓ Be transparent about limitations and risks
- ✓ Admit mistakes quickly and clearly
- ✓ Keep promises and commitments
- ✓ Show consistency over time

**Build Connection:**
- ✓ Listen actively before proposing
- ✓ Acknowledge audience concerns explicitly
- ✓ Show how your proposal helps them
- ✓ Use "you" language more than "I" language

**Remember:** Credibility is built slowly through many small actions, but can be destroyed quickly through one major breach.

[PURPOSE: Apply]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Here's the practical playbook - specific actions you can take starting today"
- Each dimension has concrete behavioral strategies

**Key Teaching Points - Competence:**
- Citing sources shows you've done research (not just opinions)
- Acknowledging what you don't know paradoxically INCREASES credibility (shows intellectual honesty)
- Over-claiming destroys competence - better to be cautiously accurate than boldly wrong

**Key Teaching Points - Character:**
- Transparency builds character - hiding problems destroys it
- Admitting mistakes early contains damage; covering up multiplies it
- Consistency over time is how character is judged (one action doesn't prove character)

**Key Teaching Points - Connection:**
- Most people talk; few listen - listening is competitive advantage
- Acknowledging concerns doesn't mean agreeing - it means showing you understand
- "You" language (you'll benefit, this helps you) vs. "I" language (I think, I believe) - shifts focus to audience

**Vietnamese Cultural Adaptation:**
- Building connection takes longer in Vietnamese culture (relationship-first culture)
- Character demonstrated through group harmony and face-saving behavior
- Competence shown through humility (not boasting) and deference to experience/seniority

**Concrete Example:**
- Weak credibility email: "I have a great idea for improving our process. Here's what I think we should do..."
- Strong credibility email: "I've been listening to the team's challenges with the current process [connection]. I researched how three similar companies solved this [competence]. I propose we try X approach, though I acknowledge we may need to adjust based on your feedback [character]. This would save you approximately 5 hours per week [connection]."

**Connection to Portfolio:**
- Persuasive Proposal (Week 5) requires building all three dimensions of credibility
- Email Series needs to show competence (professionalism), character (honesty), connection (understanding recipient's needs)

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you start an email with 'I know you're busy, so I'll be brief' - which dimension are you building?"
- Expected answer: Connection (showing you understand and respect their time)

**Transition:**
- "Now let's see a Vietnamese example of credibility building..."

**SLIDE 23: Vietnamese Example: Building Trust**

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

**Case: Viettel's International Expansion Communication**

**Context:** Viettel (state-owned telecom) expanding to 10 international markets including Peru, Haiti, Cambodia. Needed to build trust with foreign stakeholders.

**How they built credibility:**

**Competence:**
- Shared concrete success metrics (40M international customers, profitable within 3 years)
- Demonstrated technical expertise through network quality data

**Character:**
- Acknowledged challenges openly (political risk, cultural differences)
- Committed to local hiring and community investment (not just profit extraction)

**Connection:**
- Hired local leadership teams in each market
- Invested in understanding local customer needs
- Positioned as partner for development, not foreign exploiter

**Result:** Successfully entered challenging markets where Western competitors failed. Trust-building communication was key differentiator.

[PURPOSE: Inspire]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This Vietnamese success story shows strategic communication in action"
- Viettel is Vietnam's largest mobile network operator, successfully competing globally

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Viettel faced credibility gap: State-owned Vietnamese company entering markets where foreign companies often fail
- They systematically built all three dimensions of credibility through communication
- This isn't just corporate PR - this is strategic communication that enabled business success

**Competence Signals:**
- Instead of vague claims, specific numbers: 40M customers, profitability timeline
- Technical quality data showed they could deliver (not just cheap provider)

**Character Signals:**
- Openly discussing challenges (political risk, cultural barriers) showed honesty
- Commitment to local hiring and community showed values beyond profit
- This differentiated them from companies that extract value and leave

**Connection Signals:**
- Local leadership demonstrated respect and understanding
- Customer needs research showed they cared about serving market, not just selling to it
- Partner positioning (not conqueror) aligned with local priorities

**Why This Worked:**
- Markets like Peru and Haiti had seen foreign companies fail or exploit
- Viettel's credibility-first communication built trust that enabled commercial success
- Shows communication isn't separate from business strategy - it IS business strategy

**Vietnamese Pride Element:**
- This is Vietnamese company succeeding globally using communication excellence
- Validates that communication skills are strategic business tools, not soft skills
- Students can aspire to this level of strategic communication

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which of the three credibility dimensions do you think was most important for Viettel?"
- Expected answers vary - good discussion that they needed ALL three

**Transition:**
- "Let's wrap up by synthesizing what we covered today..."

---

## WRAP-UP (Slides 24-28)

---

**SLIDE 24: Key Takeaways**

CONTENT:

**Today's core concepts:**

1. **Communication models:** Shannon-Weaver (information transfer) and Transactional (dynamic exchange) help diagnose communication breakdowns

2. **Know-Feel-Do framework:** Strategic message planning requires clarity on what audience should know, feel, and do

3. **Audience analysis:** Understand stakeholders, their priorities, and adapt your message accordingly

4. **Credibility = Competence + Character + Connection:** All three required to build trust

**Remember:** Business communication is not just transmitting information - it's achieving strategic outcomes through audience-centered messaging backed by credibility.

[PURPOSE: Synthesize]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's synthesize the four main frameworks from today"
- These aren't isolated concepts - they work together

**Integration:**
- Communication models help you understand how communication works
- Know-Feel-Do helps you plan WHAT to communicate
- Audience analysis helps you determine HOW to communicate
- Credibility ensures your message is BELIEVED and ACTED ON

**Teaching Tactic:**
- Ask: "Which framework resonates most with you? Which will you use first?"
- Take 1-2 responses
- Validate all answers - different frameworks useful for different situations

**Looking Ahead:**
- Week 2 builds on this foundation with professional writing and email
- Week 3 adds persuasion and influence
- All based on these foundational frameworks
