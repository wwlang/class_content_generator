## OPENING: Concept Review & Assessment Preview (10 minutes)

### Quick Review - Three Key Frameworks

**1. Purpose-Person-Point Framework (McCormack, 2024):**
- **Purpose:** What do you want reader to do/understand? (Inform, Request, or Persuade)
- **Person:** Who is reading and what matters to them? (Language level, questions, emotional triggers)
- **Point:** Your essential message in 40-50 words stated early

**2. 4-Part Executive Summary Structure:**
1. Opening Hook (2-3 sentences) - State the point and why it matters NOW
2. Key Findings/Insights (3-5 bullets) - Most important discoveries
3. Recommendation/Action (2-3 sentences) - What should happen next
4. Impact/Benefit (1-2 sentences) - What success looks like

**3. Leadership Communication Principles (Gallo, 2022):**
- Use short words for complex topics
- Deploy sticky metaphors
- Humanize data
- Repeat core messages

---

### Assessment Preview: Group Presentation

**Your presentation handout (1 page) should:**
- Follow 4-part executive summary structure
- Apply Purpose-Person-Point framework
- Use visual hierarchy (headings, white space, bullets)
- Stand alone—audience understands key points without hearing presentation

**Key dates:**
- **Week 10:** Presentation slides due
- **Week 11:** Group presentations (15 min + 10 min Q&A)

**Today's tutorial:** Practice creating executive summaries so you're ready to write professional presentation handouts.

## MAIN ACTIVITY: Executive Summary Writing Workshop (55 minutes)

### The Scenario

You work as a Business Analyst at **FPT Software**, Vietnam's leading technology company. Your team conducted a 6-month study on employee productivity and remote work. The full report is 35 pages with detailed data analysis, survey results, and recommendations.

Your CEO requested a **1-page executive summary** to present at the next board meeting. The CEO cares about:
- Business impact (costs, productivity, revenue)
- Employee satisfaction and retention
- Competitive positioning in Vietnam's tech industry
- Clear recommendations with ROI justification

**Key findings from your 35-page report:**
- 72% of FPT employees prefer hybrid work (3 days office, 2 days remote)
- Remote work days show 18% higher productivity (measured by completed tasks)
- Office collaboration days critical for innovation and team cohesion
- Full-time remote employees show 23% higher turnover risk
- Hybrid model could save FPT $2.4M annually in office space costs
- Current policy: Full-time office work (5 days/week)
- Competitors (VNG, Grab Vietnam) already offer hybrid work—talent recruitment challenge

**Your task:** Write a 1-page executive summary (250-350 words) recommending FPT adopt a hybrid work policy.

**Note:** There's more than one valid approach to structuring this summary. Focus on applying the Purpose-Person-Point framework and 4-part structure clearly.

---

### The Framework Application (Planning Phase)

Before writing, clarify your framework:

**1. Purpose:**
- What's your primary goal? (Inform about findings / Request consideration / Persuade to adopt hybrid policy)
- What action do you want CEO to take after reading?

**2. Person (CEO priorities):**
- What language level is appropriate? (Business terms, minimal jargon)
- What questions will CEO ask? ("What's the ROI?" "What are the risks?" "Why now?")
- What emotional triggers matter? (Cost savings, competitive advantage, talent retention, productivity)

**3. Point (40-50 words):**
- Draft your opening statement—what's the essential message?
- Test: Can you state your recommendation and top 2-3 supporting reasons in ~45 words?

---

### Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:**
- 1-page executive summary (250-350 words)
- Use 4-part structure (Opening Hook, Key Findings, Recommendation/Action, Impact/Benefit)
- Apply document design principles (headings, bullets, white space)

**Considerations:**
- Start with Purpose-Person-Point planning (spend 5 minutes before drafting)
- Opening hook should include your point (recommendation) within first 50 words
- Use bullets for key findings (improves scannability)
- Quantify everything possible (percentages, dollar savings, competitive data)
- Remember: CEO cares about business outcomes, not research methodology
- Think about visual hierarchy—use headings to structure your summary

**Format suggestion:**
```
[TITLE - Bold, clear]

[Opening Hook paragraph - 2-3 sentences with main recommendation]

Key Findings:
• [Finding 1 with data]
• [Finding 2 with data]
• [Finding 3 with data]

[Recommendation/Action paragraph - 2-3 sentences]

[Impact/Benefit paragraph - 1-2 sentences painting picture of success]
```

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**Exchange work with another pair.**

**Review using these criteria:**

**Purpose-Person-Point Application:**
- [ ] Clear purpose evident (inform/request/persuade)?
- [ ] Point stated within first 50 words?
- [ ] Appropriate language level for CEO audience?
- [ ] Addresses CEO priorities (cost, productivity, talent, competition)?

**Executive Summary Structure:**
- [ ] Opening hook grabs attention and states recommendation?
- [ ] 3-5 key findings with data included?
- [ ] Clear recommendation/action with specifics?
- [ ] Impact/benefit paints picture of success?

**Document Design & Clarity:**
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clear (headings, bullets, spacing)?
- [ ] Scannable in 5 minutes or less?
- [ ] Length appropriate (250-350 words)?
- [ ] Data humanized or quantified effectively?

**Provide feedback using this format:**

**One specific strength:**
"Your opening hook immediately states the recommendation with clear ROI justification—this hooks the CEO right away."

**One area to strengthen:**
"Consider adding a bullet point about competitive positioning (VNG, Grab already offer hybrid) to create urgency."

**Remember:** You're comparing different strategic approaches, not finding errors. Multiple valid strategies exist—focus on whether the framework is applied clearly.

---

### Revision & Debrief (15 minutes)

**Revision (10 minutes):**

Based on peer feedback, revise your executive summary. Focus on:
- Strengthening your opening hook if point wasn't clear in first 50 words
- Adding quantified data if findings felt vague
- Improving visual hierarchy if summary was hard to scan
- Sharpening recommendation if action wasn't specific

**Note:** You don't need to change your overall approach—strengthen the clarity and application of frameworks.

**Class Debrief (5 minutes):**

We'll discuss as a class:
- What different strategic approaches did pairs take?
- How did Purpose-Person-Point framework shape your summary?
- What was hardest about executive summary writing?
- How will you apply this to your Group Presentation handout?
