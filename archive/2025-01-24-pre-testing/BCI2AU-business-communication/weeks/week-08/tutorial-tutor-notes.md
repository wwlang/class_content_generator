## Quiz Solutions

### Question 1: Purpose-Person-Point Framework
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
According to McCormack (2024), the three main purposes for business writing are inform (share information/updates), request (ask for action/approval/resources), and persuade (change minds/drive decisions). This framework appears on Slide 7 of the lecture.

**Why wrong:**
- A: "Entertain" is not a primary business writing purpose—business writing prioritizes clarity and action over entertainment
- C: "Argue" and "summarize" are not the framework categories—persuade is broader than argue, and summarize is a technique not a purpose
- D: "Describe" and "analyze" are not the three purposes—these are approaches used within the three main purposes

**Common confusion:** Students may confuse writing purposes with writing modes (description, narration, analysis). Business writing focuses on strategic outcomes (inform, request, persuade), not literary modes.

**Teaching tip:** Remind students that every business document should have ONE dominant purpose, even if it includes elements of others. Ask: "What action do you want from the reader?"

### Question 2: The Point Element
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
The "point" in Purpose-Person-Point framework should be stated within the first 40-50 words of the document (Slide 9). McCormack (2024) emphasizes that busy executives decide whether to keep reading based on the opening—clarity must come immediately, not after building context.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Stating point in conclusion violates BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) principle—readers may never reach conclusion if opening doesn't hook them
- B: Middle placement after background context is traditional academic writing but ineffective for business communication—executives want the answer first
- D: While repetition is important (leadership principle #4), the point must be INTRODUCED early, then reinforced throughout

**Common confusion:** Students trained in academic essay writing (intro → body → conclusion with thesis restatement) struggle with business writing's front-loaded clarity.

**Teaching tip:** Use the "15-second street encounter" test from Slide 9—if you only have 15 seconds to explain your document, what would you say? That's your point, and it belongs in the first 50 words.

---

### Question 3: Executive Summary Purpose
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
The primary purpose of an executive summary is to stand alone and enable decision-making without reading the full report (Slide 12). The "stand-alone test" means someone unfamiliar with the topic should understand the full story from the summary alone. This allows busy executives to make informed decisions in 5 minutes versus 1-2 hours reading the full report.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Detailed methodology belongs in the full report body, not the executive summary—summaries focus on findings and recommendations, not research process
- C: Executive summary is NOT an introduction—introduction previews what's coming in the document; summary provides complete story with conclusions
- D: References/sources may be briefly mentioned if critical, but listing all sources is for bibliography/references section, not executive summary

**Common confusion:** Students confuse executive summary with introduction or abstract. Key distinction: summary is comprehensive standalone document; introduction is preview; abstract is brief description.

**Teaching tip:** Give students the "CEO test"—if CEO only reads your executive summary and skips the full report, can they make an informed decision? If no, the summary fails.

---

### Question 4: Executive Summary Length
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Executive summaries typically should be 10% of the full document length (Slide 12). Examples: 40-page report = 4-page max summary; 10-page report = 1-page summary. The guideline balances comprehensiveness (must stand alone) with conciseness (must be quickly readable).

**Why wrong:**
- A: 5% is too short for most documents—wouldn't provide enough detail to stand alone and enable decision-making
- C: 25% is too long—defeats the purpose of a summary; executives want condensed version, not quarter of full report
- D: 50% is absurd—that's not a summary, it's half the document; provides no time-saving benefit

**Common confusion:** Students may not know there's a standard guideline for summary length and either write too briefly (missing critical info) or too verbosely (defeating purpose).

**Teaching tip:** Emphasize the 10% guideline as starting point, with 1-2 pages as sweet spot for most business reports. Quality matters more than hitting exact percentage—stand-alone test is ultimate measure.

### Question 5: Leadership Communication - Short Words
**Correct: A**

**Why A is correct:**
Daniel Kahneman stated: "If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do" (Slide 14). Counter-intuitively, complex language makes you seem LESS intelligent and credible because it suggests you don't truly understand the concept or you're trying to impress rather than communicate. Simple language demonstrates mastery and confidence.

**Why wrong:**
- B: This answer is condescending and incorrect—readers CAN understand complex words, but complex language creates unnecessary cognitive load and reduces clarity
- C: While true that short words may be easier to translate, this isn't Kahneman's main point about credibility and intelligence
- D: While complex language may take longer to write, the reason to avoid it is about reader perception of credibility, not writer efficiency

**Common confusion:** Students (especially non-native English speakers) often think big vocabulary = intelligence. This is opposite of business communication reality.

**Teaching tip:** Share the Jeff Bezos example from lecture—his shareholder letters evolved from 10th-grade to 8th/9th-grade reading level deliberately. Sophisticated ideas don't require complicated wording.

### Question 6: Sticky Metaphors
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Warren Buffett's "moats and castles" metaphor (Slide 15) is a perfect example of deploying sticky metaphors—translating abstract business concept (competitive advantages) into concrete imagery (medieval defensive architecture). Everyone understands moats protect castles from invaders, so the metaphor makes business strategy immediately comprehensible and memorable.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Humanizing data involves making statistics relatable through comparisons (e.g., lip balm spending vs. NASA budget)—moats/castles isn't about data
- B: Using short words is about vocabulary simplicity, not metaphorical imagery
- D: Making mission your mantra is about repetition of core messages, not metaphorical framing

**Common confusion:** Students may confuse the four leadership communication principles. Metaphors = abstract → concrete imagery; Data humanization = statistics → relatable comparisons.

**Teaching tip:** Ask students to create their own sticky metaphor for a business concept (e.g., "Our data is scattered across systems like ingredients in 15 different kitchens"). Practice makes this skill accessible.

---

### Question 7: Humanizing Data
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Neil deGrasse Tyson's comparison of NASA's $3 billion Cassini mission to lip balm spending (Slide 16) is textbook humanizing data. $3 billion is incomprehensibly large—the brain can't process that scale. Comparing to familiar consumer product (lip balm) makes the number suddenly relatable and contextualizes the mission cost as reasonable.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Short words principle is about vocabulary simplicity, not data contextualization
- C: Metaphors translate abstract concepts to concrete imagery; data humanization specifically makes statistics relatable through comparisons
- D: Mission mantra is about message repetition, not data presentation

**Common confusion:** Students may think any comparison = metaphor. Distinction: Metaphors are figurative ("Our CEO is a lion" = brave, strong); Data humanization uses literal comparisons ("$3B = less than lip balm spending" = factually accurate scale comparison).

**Teaching tip:** Challenge students to humanize data from tutorial activity: "FPT's $2.4M annual savings = funding 48 new software engineer salaries" or "18% productivity increase = gaining extra 90 minutes per workday."

### Question 8: Visual Hierarchy
**Correct: D**

**Why D is correct:**
Eye-tracking research shows readers decide whether to engage with a document in 2-3 seconds based on visual first impression (Slide 18). This harsh reality means document design is not cosmetic—it determines whether content gets read at all. Poor design (dense walls of text, no spacing, tiny font) causes immediate bounce.

**Why wrong:**
- A: 30 seconds is longer than actual first impression window—initial visual judgment happens almost instantly (2-3 seconds)
- B: 10-15 seconds is still too long—visual hierarchy judgment is nearly instantaneous
- C: 5 minutes is how long executives spend READING a good executive summary, not making initial engagement decision

**Common confusion:** Students underestimate how quickly readers make visual judgments. They may spend hours writing but neglect the 2-3 second visual test.

**Teaching tip:** Show side-by-side examples of same content with poor vs. good design. Ask: "Which would you read?" Students immediately choose well-designed version, proving the point viscerally.

### Question 9: Document Design - Font Choice
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Recent research indicates sans serif fonts (Arial, Calibri) are generally more readable on screens, particularly for readers with visual impairments (Slide 19). Since most business documents are read on screens (computers, tablets, phones), sans serif fonts enhance accessibility and comprehension. Serif fonts (Times New Roman) were historically preferred for print but are less optimal for digital reading.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Serif fonts can reduce readability on screens, especially for those with visual impairments—research cited in lecture favors sans serif for digital documents
- C: Decorative/script fonts are almost never appropriate for business documents—readability is extremely poor
- D: Monospace fonts (Courier) are used for code/technical documentation but are harder to read for body text in business documents

**Common confusion:** Students may have been taught Times New Roman is "professional standard" without understanding screen vs. print readability differences.

**Teaching tip:** Note that while sans serif is generally preferred, ultimate test is readability for specific audience and medium. Acknowledge Times New Roman is still widely used but explain trend toward sans serif for digital business communication.

### Question 10: Technical Writing
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
The most effective approach for translating technical information for non-technical audiences is to focus on outcomes and business impact while defining unavoidable jargon (Slides 20-21). Non-technical decision-makers care about WHAT technology does and WHY it matters (business results), not HOW it works (mechanisms). If technical terms are necessary, define them immediately in parentheses or same sentence.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Removing ALL technical terms may lose precision—better to define necessary terms than avoid them entirely
- B: Focusing on mechanisms (how it works) is what technical audiences want; non-technical audiences need outcomes (what it delivers)
- D: Using maximum technical terms demonstrates expertise to technical peers but alienates and confuses non-technical decision-makers

**Common confusion:** Students (especially those with technical backgrounds) may think technical detail = credibility. For non-technical audiences, clarity = credibility.

**Teaching tip:** Reference Slide 22 case study—contrast technical version (microservices, Kubernetes, Docker) with translated version (40% speed improvement, $200K savings). Both accurate, but translated version gets CEO approval.

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

The Executive Summary Writing Workshop is deliberately open-ended—there is no single "correct" executive summary for the FPT hybrid work scenario. Students may emphasize different data points (cost savings vs. productivity vs. talent retention), use different structures, or make recommendations with varying degrees of boldness (pilot program vs. full rollout). This ambiguity mirrors real professional scenarios where strategic choices involve trade-offs. Your role is to help students apply the frameworks clearly, not to converge on one "right answer."

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- Purpose clearly defined (most likely "Persuade CEO to adopt hybrid work policy")
- Person analysis evident (CEO priorities addressed: cost, productivity, talent, competition)
- Point stated in first 40-50 words (specific recommendation with top justification)
- 4-part structure followed (Opening Hook, Key Findings 3-5 bullets, Recommendation/Action, Impact/Benefit)
- Data quantified and specific (72% prefer hybrid, 18% productivity gain, $2.4M savings, 23% turnover risk)
- Visual hierarchy applied (headings, bullets, white space make summary scannable)
- Length appropriate (250-350 words, roughly fits 1 page)
- Stands alone (reader unfamiliar with FPT scenario can understand full story)

**Critical Moments:**

**During Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes):**

Circulate and observe student progress around the 5-10 minute mark. Many students will jump straight to drafting without completing Purpose-Person-Point planning. Gently redirect: "Before you write, have you clarified your Purpose, Person, and Point? Take 2 minutes to write those down explicitly." This reinforces that planning precedes execution (core insight from McCormack).

Around the 15-minute mark, check that students are using the 4-part structure. Some may write traditional introduction-body-conclusion format instead. Intervene with questions: "Where's your opening hook that states the recommendation immediately?" or "Can you break your findings into 3-5 scannable bullets?" Guide them toward business writing structure, not academic essay format.

If pairs finish early (unlikely but possible), challenge them to revise for visual hierarchy: "Add headings. Use bullets effectively. Create white space. Test: Can someone scan your summary in 60 seconds and grasp the key recommendation?" This deepens engagement with document design principles.

**During Peer Review (15 minutes):**

Monitor peer review conversations carefully. Vietnamese students may be uncomfortable critiquing peers directly, even constructively. Reinforce the feedback framework provided in tutorial-content.md: "One specific strength" before "One area to strengthen." Model the language: "I'm not saying your summary is wrong—I'm comparing our different strategic approaches. You emphasized cost savings; I emphasized talent retention. Both are valid." This frames peer review as exploration rather than criticism.

Watch for students who provide vague feedback ("Good job!" or "It's fine"). Intervene with scaffolding questions: "What specifically works well about their opening hook?" or "How could they strengthen the data in their key findings?" Push for concrete, actionable feedback that references the rubric criteria. Around the 10-minute mark, if you notice superficial peer review, pause the class briefly and model one example of quality feedback using anonymous student work.

Some students may debate whose summary is "better" or "more correct." Redirect: "Both summaries can be excellent while making different strategic choices. The question isn't 'which is right?' but 'does each clearly apply the Purpose-Person-Point framework and 4-part structure?' Focus your feedback on framework application, not strategy selection." This validates multiple approaches while maintaining focus on skill demonstration.

**During Revision & Debrief (15 minutes):**

Give genuine revision time (10 minutes minimum). Students need time to incorporate feedback thoughtfully, not rush superficial changes. Circulate and offer targeted help: "You revised your opening—does it now state your point in the first 50 words? Count them." or "You added bullets—do they include quantified data (percentages, dollar amounts)?"

In the 5-minute class debrief, elicit variety in approaches: "How many emphasized cost savings as primary driver? How many emphasized talent retention? How many emphasized competitive positioning?" Show hands for each. Then synthesize: "Notice that different strategic emphases are all valid IF you apply the framework clearly. In real business contexts, you'd customize based on what you know about the specific CEO's priorities."

Ask reflective questions: "What was hardest about executive summary writing?" Common answers: stating point early (feels abrupt), cutting content to stay concise (everything feels important), visual hierarchy (unfamiliar skill). Validate these challenges and reinforce that practice builds fluency. Connect to Group Presentation: "You'll write a similar 1-page handout for your presentation. Today's practice prepares you—you now have a template and feedback experience to draw from."

**Timing Flexibility:**

The main activity has built-in flexibility. If peer review is going well and students are deeply engaged, you can extend it by 5 minutes and reduce revision time slightly (still ensure minimum 5 minutes for revision). Conversely, if pairs finish individual work quickly, you can start peer review earlier. The quiz practice section (15-20 minutes) can be shortened to 10-12 minutes if needed by reviewing fewer questions in depth, or assigned as homework if time runs very short. Prioritize the hands-on executive summary writing—this is the core skill-building activity. Quiz prep is important but secondary to application practice.
