## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome students to Week 8 focusing on business reports and executive communication

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Today we shift from persuasive communication to strategic document writing
- Business reports are among the most critical documents professionals create
- Executive summaries often determine whether full reports get read
- This week's skills apply directly to your written portfolio and presentation preparation

**Transition:**
- "Before we dive into frameworks and techniques, let's talk about why this matters in the real world..."

**SLIDE 2: The High-Stakes World of Business Writing**

TITLE: The High-Stakes World of Business Writing

CONTENT:

Imagine submitting a 40-page report to leadership—but they only read page one.

**The Reality:**
- Business leaders receive countless reports weekly
- Executive summaries take 5 minutes to read vs. 1-2 hours for full reports (PandaDoc, 2023)
- You have 30 seconds to grab attention with your summary
- Poor communication costs U.S. businesses $2 trillion annually—over $15,000 per employee (Grammarly, 2024)

**Today's question:** How do you ensure your writing gets read AND acted upon?

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Hook]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Ask class: "How many of you have written a long document that you're not sure anyone fully read?" [Show of hands creates connection]
- Validate this common frustration

**Key Teaching Points:**
- The 5-minute vs. 1-2 hour statistic is dramatic—emphasize the attention economy
- $15,000 per employee annually lost to poor communication—that's significant waste
- 30 seconds is all you get to hook a reader with executive summary
- This isn't about writing more; it's about writing strategically

**Examples/Stories:**
- Share example: Student writes excellent analysis buried on page 12—decision-maker never sees it
- Vietnamese context: In fast-paced Hanoi or HCMC business environment, executives juggle many priorities

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why do you think poor communication is so costly?" [Take 1-2 responses—expect answers about rework, delays, errors]

**Transition:**
- "Today we'll learn frameworks that ensure your writing cuts through noise and drives action..."

**SLIDE 3: Key Vocabulary**

TITLE: Key Business Writing Terminology

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: vocab-table -->

| English Term | Vietnamese Translation | Context |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Executive Summary** | Tóm tắt điều hành | Condensed overview of full report for decision-makers |
| **White Paper** | Báo cáo chuyên đề | Authoritative report presenting research and solutions |
| **Policy Brief** | Bản tóm tắt chính sách | Short document recommending specific policy actions |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Phân cấp trực quan | Arrangement of elements to guide reader attention |

[PURPOSE: Prime vocabulary]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Introduce vocabulary critical for today's lesson
- These terms appear in professional business communication globally

**Key Teaching Points:**
- BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) comes from military communication—extreme clarity under pressure
- Purpose-Person-Point is today's core framework (we'll explore deeply)
- White papers common in Vietnam for policy recommendations and industry research
- Visual hierarchy determines whether documents get read or ignored

**Examples/Stories:**
- BLUF example: Email subject lines—compare "Meeting Follow-Up" vs. "Action Required: Budget Approval by Friday 5pm"
- Vietnamese context: Policy briefs used by ministries and government agencies

**Transition:**
- "Now that we have vocabulary foundation, let's establish learning objectives..."

- Address concerns if most haven't started

**Transition:**
- "Now let's explore the core framework that transforms average writing into great writing..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Part 1: The Purpose-Person-Point Framework**

---

**SLIDE 6: The Foundation of Great Business Writing**

TITLE: The Purpose-Person-Point Framework

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Purpose (The North Star):** What do you want the reader to do or understand?

**Person (Audience Analysis):** Who is reading and what matters to them?

**Point (Core Message):** What is your essential message in 40-50 words?

"Writing errors typically originate in the planning phase, not drafting. Most people jump straight to writing without clarifying these three elements first." (McCormack, 2024)

[PURPOSE: Introduce framework]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

*McCormack, S. (2024, March 11). How to take your business writing from "average" to "great." Harvard Business Review. https://hbr.org/2024/03/how-to-take-your-business-writing-from-average-to-great*

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Introduce the "Three P's" as systematic approach to all business writing
- Write framework on board: Purpose → Person → Point
- Emphasize these are sequential—you must clarify in this order

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Purpose = your North Star guiding all decisions (inform, request, or persuade)
- Person = deep audience understanding (language level, questions they'll ask, emotional triggers)
- Point = distilled essence stated early (within first 40-50 words)
- Planning precedes execution—this is THE critical insight

**Examples/Stories:**
- Contrast: Email without clarity ("Just wanted to update you...") vs. clear purpose ("Requesting approval for Q3 budget increase to $50K")
- Vietnamese context: In hierarchical cultures, understanding "person" (decision-maker's priorities) is crucial

**Common Misconceptions:**
- Students think good writing = good grammar → Clarify: Good writing = clear thinking + strategic structure + good grammar
- Planning feels like extra work → Actually saves massive time by preventing rewrites

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Before today, how many of you consciously thought about Purpose-Person-Point before writing?" [Show of hands—expect few]
- Validate this as new skill to practice

**Transition:**
- "Let's unpack each element starting with Purpose..."

---

**SLIDE 7: Purpose - Your North Star**

TITLE: Element 1 - Define Your Purpose

CONTENT:

**Three Main Purposes:**

1. **Inform** - Share information or updates (status reports, meeting minutes)
2. **Request** - Ask for action, approval, or resources (proposals, requests)
3. **Persuade** - Change minds or drive decisions (recommendations, arguments)

**Critical Question:** What action or response do you want from the reader?

**Example:**
- ❌ Unclear: "I wanted to share some thoughts on the project"
- ✅ Clear Purpose (Request): "I'm requesting approval to extend the project deadline by two weeks due to unforeseen technical challenges"

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Explain purpose element]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

*McCormack, S. (2024). How to take your business writing from "average" to "great." Harvard Business Review.*

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Purpose is foundational—everything else flows from this
- Most weak writing lacks clear purpose from the start

**Key Teaching Points:**
- The three purposes aren't mutually exclusive (persuasive messages also inform) but ONE should dominate
- "What action or response?" forces specificity—vague purpose = vague writing
- Knowing purpose creates context for entire document structure
- Inform → straightforward presentation; Request → clear ask with justification; Persuade → build case systematically

**Examples/Stories:**
- Bad example: Student emails professor rambling about assignment without clear ask
- Good example: "I'm requesting a 2-day extension on Assignment 3 due to medical emergency [attach documentation]. I can submit by October 15."
- Vietnamese example: Government ministry requesting budget allocation—purpose must be crystal clear

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Being direct is rude" → Clarify: Clarity is respectful of reader's time
- Vietnamese context: Directness can feel culturally uncomfortable, but business writing values efficiency

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the purpose of a status report?" [Answer: Inform]
- "What's the purpose of a persuasive proposal?" [Answer: Persuade to take action]

**Transition:**
- "Once you know your purpose, you must deeply understand your person—your audience..."

---

**SLIDE 8: Person - Know Your Audience**

TITLE: Element 2 - Understand Your Person (Audience)

CONTENT:

**Three Critical Elements:**

**1. Language Alignment:** Match reader's vocabulary and sophistication level
- Technical expert vs. general manager vs. external stakeholder
- Adjust complexity accordingly

**2. Question Anticipation:** Address "What's in it for me?"
- What will reader naturally ask while reading?
- Answer questions before they're asked

**3. Emotional Triggers:** Identify topics that matter to your specific audience
- Cost savings for CFO, innovation for CEO, efficiency for operations manager
- Connect to reader's priorities and pain points

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Explain person element]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

*McCormack, S. (2024). How to take your business writing from "average" to "great." Harvard Business Review.*

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Person = audience analysis on steroids
- This step prevents writing documents that nobody reads

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Language alignment: Don't use jargon with non-technical readers; don't oversimplify for experts
- Question anticipation: Put yourself in reader's shoes—what would YOU wonder?
- Emotional triggers: Everyone has priorities—CFO cares about cost, engineers care about feasibility, marketers care about customer impact
- "What's in it for me?" (WIIFM) is universal question readers ask

**Examples/Stories:**
- Example: Proposing new software to CEO (focus: ROI, competitive advantage) vs. IT team (focus: technical specs, integration)
- Vietnamese context: Understanding hierarchy and decision-making authority—who actually approves decisions?
- Story: Student writes technical report using engineering jargon for business professor—gets poor grade despite solid analysis

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "One document fits all audiences" → Clarify: Always customize for primary reader
- Students often write for themselves, not for actual audience

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If you're proposing flexible work policy to HR director vs. CEO, what emotional triggers differ?" [Take 1-2 responses—HR: employee satisfaction/retention; CEO: productivity/cost]

**Transition:**
- "After clarifying purpose and understanding person, you distill your point..."

---

**SLIDE 9: Point - Your Essential Message**

TITLE: Element 3 - State Your Point Early

CONTENT:

**The Core Message:**
- Your point is the essential message stated within first 40-50 words
- Think of it as the arrow being shot toward your target reader

**The 15-Second Test:**
"Imagine running into your reader on the street. You have 15 seconds to explain your message before they walk away. What would you say? That's likely your point." (McCormack, 2024)

**Why Early?**
- Readers want to know immediately: What is this about and why should I care?
- Clarity precedes action—documents don't generate outcomes until readers understand the message

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Explain point element]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

*McCormack, S. (2024). How to take your business writing from "average" to "great." Harvard Business Review.*

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Point = distilled essence of your entire document
- Most powerful writing states the point immediately (BLUF principle)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- 40-50 words forces brutal clarity—no room for fluff
- The 15-second test is brilliant: simulates elevator pitch urgency
- State point EARLY (first paragraph, ideally first 2-3 sentences)
- Your document will not generate any outcome until readers understand your message (quote this—powerful)
- Busy executives decide whether to keep reading based on first 50 words

**Examples/Stories:**
- Bad example: Email that rambles for 3 paragraphs before getting to request
- Good example: "I recommend increasing our marketing budget by 20% ($50K) for Q4 to capture holiday season demand, projected to generate $300K additional revenue." (30 words, crystal clear)
- Vietnamese context: In meetings, Vietnamese professionals may prefer indirect communication, but written business documents demand directness

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Build suspense before revealing point" → Clarify: Business writing is NOT creative writing—no suspense, just clarity
- Students fear being too direct = seeming aggressive → Reframe: Directness = respect for reader's time

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Practice the 15-second test: Summarize your last major assignment in 15 seconds" [Pick 1-2 volunteers to try]

**Transition:**
- "Now let's see Purpose-Person-Point in action through case analysis..."

---

**SLIDE 10: Case Study - Purpose-Person-Point in Action**

TITLE: Vietnamese Context - Applying the Framework

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

**Scenario:** You're a project manager at VNG Corporation (Vietnam's tech leader). Your team developed an AI chatbot for customer service, but it needs additional $100K funding to launch. You're writing a proposal to the CFO.

**Framework Application:**

**Purpose:** Persuade CFO to approve $100K additional funding

**Person (CFO priorities):**
- Cost-benefit analysis (ROI focus)
- Risk mitigation
- Competitive positioning
- Answers "How does this impact bottom line?"

**Point (First 50 words):**
"I recommend investing $100K to launch our AI customer service chatbot by Q1 2026. This investment will reduce customer service costs by 30% annually ($500K savings), improve response time from 2 hours to 2 minutes, and position VNG as Vietnam's first major tech company offering AI-powered support."

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Transition to practical application using Vietnamese company
- VNG Corporation is recognizable to students (Zalo, VNG Cloud, gaming)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Notice how framework shaped the proposal approach
- Purpose = Persuade (not just inform about chatbot)
- Person analysis = CFO cares about money, ROI, competitive advantage—NOT technical details
- Point = 49 words, includes specific ask ($100K), clear benefit ($500K annual savings), timeline (Q1 2026), competitive angle
- This point hooks CFO immediately—clear why they should care

**Examples/Stories:**
- Contrast with bad approach: "We've been working on AI chatbot and wanted to share progress..." (no clear ask, no CFO hook)
- Vietnamese context: VNG competes with Grab, FPT, other tech companies—competitive positioning matters

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What would change if audience were CTO instead of CFO?" [Answer: Focus on technical innovation, integration, scalability—less on cost]
- "What's the ROI timeframe here?" [Answer: $100K investment, $500K annual savings = breakeven in ~2.4 months]

**Transition:**
- "The framework works. Now let's apply it to executive summaries..."

<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Part 2: Executive Summaries That Get Read**

---

**SLIDE 11: Why Executive Summaries Matter**

TITLE: The Make-or-Break Document

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

**5 minutes**

Average time executives spend reading a one-page executive summary

vs.

1-2 hours to read full business plan or report

**Reality Check:**
- Many business leaders only read summaries—they depend on summaries to give them highlights
- 30 seconds to grab attention with opening
- Your full report might be excellent, but if summary fails, it doesn't get read

[PURPOSE: Emphasize importance]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Dramatic contrast: 5 minutes vs. 1-2 hours
- This slide should create urgency about executive summary quality

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Executives are time-constrained—they triage using summaries
- "Executives only read the summaries" is corporate reality (research confirms this)
- 30-second attention span means opening sentence is critical
- Your excellent analysis on page 27 might never be seen if summary doesn't hook reader
- Summary isn't "nice to have"—it's THE document that determines whether full report gets read

**Examples/Stories:**
- Story: CEO receives 15 reports weekly—only has time to read summaries, delegates full reading to staff
- Vietnamese context: In government ministries or large Vietnamese corporations (Vingroup, FPT), leaders juggle many priorities

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Summary is just shorter version" → Clarify: Summary is strategic distillation focused on decisions
- Students treat summaries as afterthought → Reframe: Summary should be crafted first or with most care

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How many of you have written a summary after finishing a report, spending minimal time?" [Show of hands—expect many]
- Validate but challenge: "Today we learn to write summaries strategically"

**Transition:**
- "So what makes an executive summary effective? Let's break down the formula..."

---

**SLIDE 12: Executive Summary Formula**

TITLE: The 4-Part Executive Summary Structure

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**1. Opening Hook (2-3 sentences):** State the point and why it matters NOW

**2. Key Findings/Insights (3-5 bullets):** Most important discoveries or conclusions

**3. Recommendation/Action (2-3 sentences):** What should happen next and why

**4. Impact/Benefit (1-2 sentences):** What success looks like

**Length:** Typically 10% of full document (1-2 pages max for most business reports)

**Golden Rule:** Executive summary must stand alone—reader should understand full story without reading report

[PURPOSE: Teach structure]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Introduce 4-part structure as formula students can apply repeatedly
- This structure works for business reports, proposals, white papers, policy briefs

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Opening Hook: Use Purpose-Person-Point framework—state point within first 50 words
- Key Findings: Bullets improve scannability—busy executives scan rather than read
- Recommendation/Action: Be specific ("Approve $50K budget increase" not "Consider options")
- Impact/Benefit: Paint picture of success—what happens if recommendation is followed?
- 10% guideline: 40-page report = 4-page max summary; 10-page report = 1-page summary
- "Stand alone" test: Give summary to someone unfamiliar—can they understand the full story?

**Examples/Stories:**
- Example: Government policy brief recommending education reform—summary must convince ministers in 2 pages
- Vietnamese context: ASEAN business proposals often require executive summaries for regional partners

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Summary = introduction" → Clarify: Introduction previews what's coming; summary provides complete story
- Students include too much detail → Reframe: Summary highlights only what matters for decision

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the stand-alone test?" [Answer: Reader unfamiliar with topic should understand full story from summary alone]
- "If your report is 30 pages, how long should summary be?" [Answer: ~3 pages max, ideally 1-2 pages]

**Transition:**
- "Let's see this structure in action with before-and-after examples..."

---

**SLIDE 13: Executive Summary - Before vs. After**

TITLE: Weak vs. Strong Executive Summary

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: comparison-table -->

| ❌ Weak Executive Summary | ✅ Strong Executive Summary |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| "This report examines customer satisfaction trends over the past year. We collected data from multiple sources and analyzed various metrics. There are several interesting findings discussed in the full report." | "Customer satisfaction dropped 15% in Q3-Q4 2024, driven primarily by slow response times (average 8 hours vs. industry standard 2 hours). We recommend implementing AI chatbot support and hiring 3 additional service agents, requiring $150K investment to recover satisfaction and prevent projected $2M revenue loss." |
| **Problems:** Vague, no specific findings, no clear recommendation, no urgency | **Strengths:** Specific problem (15% drop), root cause (slow response), clear recommendation (chatbot + hiring), quantified investment ($150K) and risk ($2M loss) |

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Side-by-side comparison makes differences vivid
- Weak example is unfortunately common in student/professional writing

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Weak summary: Describes what report does, not what it finds—this is useless to executives
- Weak summary: "Interesting findings" without stating them—forces reader to dig into report
- Strong summary: Leads with specific problem (15% drop), quantifies everything, clear action
- Strong summary: Uses Purpose-Person-Point—Purpose (persuade to invest), Person (decision-maker cares about revenue risk), Point (stated in 42 words)
- Strong summary: Creates urgency ($2M revenue loss if no action)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Imagine you're CEO reading these summaries—which gets your attention?
- Vietnamese context: FPT or Viettel executive reviewing IT infrastructure proposal—needs specifics fast

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Save findings for report body" → Clarify: Summary reveals conclusions; body provides supporting evidence
- Students fear giving away "the answer" → Reframe: Business readers want answer immediately

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What makes the weak summary weak?" [Take responses: vague, no numbers, no recommendation, no urgency]
- "What's the risk quantified in strong summary?" [Answer: $2M revenue loss]

**Transition:**
- "Now let's shift to how great leaders write at the sentence and word level..."

<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Part 3: How Great Leaders Communicate in Writing**

---

**SLIDE 14: Leadership Communication Principle 1**

TITLE: Use Short Words for Complex Topics

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

"If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do."

— Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize-winning economist (as cited in Gallo, 2022)

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Introduce leadership communication section—these are practices of world's best communicators
- Kahneman quote is powerful because he's Nobel laureate—ultimate credibility

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Counter-intuitive insight: Complex language makes you seem LESS intelligent, not more
- Credibility comes from clarity, not vocabulary
- Great leaders write at 8th-9th grade reading level for sophisticated ideas
- Example: Jeff Bezos's shareholder letters evolved from 10th-grade to 8th/9th-grade level over time—deliberate choice

**Examples/Stories:**
- Bad example: "We must optimize our organizational infrastructure to facilitate synergistic outcomes"
- Good example: "We need to restructure our teams to work better together"
- Vietnamese context: Students learning English may think complex vocabulary = better writing → Opposite is true

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Big words = sounding smart" → Clarify: Big words = sounding pretentious and unclear
- "Simple language = dumbing down" → Reframe: Simple language = respecting reader's time and cognitive load

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why would simpler language make you seem MORE credible?" [Take responses: easier to understand, shows confidence, demonstrates mastery of topic]

**Transition:**
- "Beyond word choice, great leaders use sticky metaphors..."

---

**SLIDE 15: Leadership Communication Principle 2**

TITLE: Deploy Sticky Metaphors

CONTENT:

**The Power of Metaphor:**
Metaphors translate abstract concepts into concrete imagery that sticks in memory.

**Examples from Great Leaders:**

**Warren Buffett - "Moats and Castles":**
Competitive advantages = moats protecting business castles from competitor attacks
(Became shorthand for analyzing business strategy)

**Chris Hadfield (Astronaut) - Rocket Launch:**
"Like a dragon roaring to life" / "Leaf in a hurricane"
(Made incomprehensible G-forces relatable)

**Application:** When explaining complex concepts, find tangible comparisons your audience already understands.

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Teach metaphor technique]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

*Gallo, C. (2022, November 22). How great leaders communicate. Harvard Business Review. https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-great-leaders-communicate*

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Metaphors are cognitive shortcuts—brain processes images faster than abstractions
- This technique separates memorable communication from forgettable

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Sticky metaphor = one that audience remembers and repeats
- Warren Buffett's "moats" metaphor: Everyone knows castles and moats = defensive protection → Business competitive advantage makes sense
- Chris Hadfield's rocket metaphors: G-forces are abstract → Dragon roaring, leaf in hurricane are visceral and imaginable
- Good metaphors use concepts audience already understands to explain new concepts
- Metaphors aid retention and make you quotable

**Examples/Stories:**
- Business example: "Our data is scattered across 15 systems—it's like trying to cook a meal with ingredients in 15 different kitchens"
- Vietnamese context: Use local imagery—"Our workflow is like District 1 traffic at 5pm: congested and inefficient. We need traffic lights (process automation)."

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Metaphors are unprofessional" → Clarify: Best business communicators use metaphors extensively
- Students avoid metaphors in formal writing → Encourage creative clarity

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can someone create a metaphor for... unclear communication in teams?" [Take 1-2 responses—e.g., "playing telephone game," "GPS without signal"]

**Transition:**
- "Another technique great leaders use: humanizing data..."

---

**SLIDE 16: Leadership Communication Principle 3**

TITLE: Humanize Data

CONTENT:

**The Problem:** Raw statistics overwhelm audiences and reduce engagement.

**The Solution:** Contextualize numbers using relatable comparisons.

**Example - Neil deGrasse Tyson:**
NASA's Cassini mission cost: $3 billion
↓
Americans spend more annually on lip balm than NASA spent on Cassini

**Why This Works:**
- Reduces cognitive strain (comparing to familiar reference)
- Maintains credibility (accurate comparison)
- Makes abstract numbers tangible (everyone knows lip balm cost)

**Your Turn:** When presenting data, ask: "What does this number mean in terms my audience already understands?"

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Teach data humanization]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

*Gallo, C. (2022). How great leaders communicate. Harvard Business Review.*

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Data is essential but overwhelming—humanizing makes it stick
- Neil deGrasse Tyson is master of this technique

**Key Teaching Points:**
- $3 billion is incomprehensibly large—brain can't process scale
- Lip balm comparison: Everyone buys lip balm → Suddenly $3 billion is relatable
- This technique works for any data: time, money, scale, frequency
- Key: Find comparison audience already understands and relate to
- Maintains credibility because comparison is accurate, not exaggeration

**Examples/Stories:**
- Example: "Our website loads in 8 seconds—users will abandon it before finishing their first sip of coffee"
- Vietnamese context: "Traffic from District 7 to District 1 takes 45 minutes—same time it takes to read our 20-page report. Let's create a 2-page summary."
- Example: "We processed 2 million transactions last year—equivalent to every person in Hanoi making 2 purchases"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Data speaks for itself" → Clarify: Data needs interpretation and context
- Students present data without making it meaningful → Coach: Always translate numbers

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If you're presenting '50,000 customers,' how could you humanize this for Vietnamese audience?" [Take responses—e.g., "Enough to fill My Dinh Stadium," "Population of a small Vietnamese district"]

**Transition:**
- "Final leadership principle: repetition of mission..."

---

**SLIDE 17: Leadership Communication Principle 4**

TITLE: Make Mission Your Mantra

CONTENT:

**The Medtronic Example:**
- Mission statement: "Alleviate pain, restore health, extend life"
- 90,000 employees across 60+ years repeated this mission
- Constant repetition built transformational culture

**Harvard Research Finding:**
Leaders typically under-communicate vision by a factor of 10 (Kotter, as cited in Gallo, 2022)

**Insight from Indra Nooyi (Former PepsiCo CEO):**
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

"If you cannot simplify a message and communicate it compellingly, believe me, you cannot get the masses to follow you."

**Application:** In reports and documents, reinforce core message multiple times—don't assume one mention is enough.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Repetition feels redundant to writers but is essential for readers
- This principle applies to mission statements, key recommendations, core messages

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Medtronic mission: 7 words, repeated for 60 years across 90,000 people—embedding in culture
- Leaders under-communicate by 10x: You think you've said it enough, but audience needs to hear 10 times more
- Indra Nooyi's quote: Simplification + repetition + compelling delivery = followership
- In business reports: State recommendation in executive summary, restate in introduction, reinforce in conclusion, emphasize in recommendations section
- Don't fear redundancy—readers skim and need reinforcement

**Examples/Stories:**
- Example: Apple's "Think Different" repeated endlessly in communications—brand identity
- Vietnamese context: VinFast's mission to put Vietnamese cars globally—repeated in every communication
- Student application: In presentation, state thesis 3-4 times across introduction, body, conclusion

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Repetition is boring" → Clarify: Strategically varied repetition reinforces message
- Students mention key point once and move on → Coach: Repeat core message at least 3 times

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why do leaders under-communicate by 10x?" [Take responses: Assume people heard it, forget people are distracted, overestimate attention]
- "How can you vary repetition to avoid sounding redundant?" [Answer: Rephrase, different contexts, different media]

**Transition:**
- "Now let's apply these leadership principles to document design..."

**SLIDE 18: Why Document Design Matters**

TITLE: The First 3 Seconds

CONTENT:

**Eye-Tracking Research Finding:**
Readers decide whether to engage with a document in 2-3 seconds based on visual first impression.

**Visual Hierarchy Principle:**
Arrange elements so readers instantly recognize their order of importance through size, weight, color, and spacing.

**Impact on Readability:**
Well-designed documents with proper fonts, spacing, and headings:
- ✅ Enhance readability
- ✅ Increase engagement
- ✅ Improve comprehension
- ✅ Make content less intimidating

**Poor Design Consequences:**
Readers bounce—they never give your content a chance.

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Establish importance]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Visual design determines whether content gets read—design is not cosmetic
- 2-3 second decision window is harsh reality

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Eye-tracking studies show predictable scan patterns (F-shape for long-form content)
- Visual hierarchy = using visual cues to show what's most important
- Size, weight, color, spacing all signal importance to reader's brain
- Good design reduces cognitive load—makes reading effortless
- Poor design creates friction—even excellent content gets ignored

**Examples/Stories:**
- Show example: Dense wall of text vs. same content with headings, bullets, white space
- Vietnamese context: Government policy documents often suffer from poor design—difficult to extract key information

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Content is what matters, not design" → Clarify: Design determines whether content gets read
- Students treat design as afterthought → Reframe: Design and content are inseparable

**Check for Understanding:**
- "When you receive a long email with no paragraphs or spacing, what's your reaction?" [Expect: "I don't read it," "I skim it," "I ignore it"]
- Validate and emphasize: That's why design matters

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down specific design techniques..."

---

**SLIDE 19: Visual Hierarchy Techniques**

TITLE: Design Techniques That Improve Readability

CONTENT:

**1. Headings & Subheadings:**
- Divide content into scannable sections
- Make document less intimidating
- Help readers find what they need quickly

**2. White Space:**
- Margins and spacing between elements
- Prevents overwhelming "wall of text"
- Guides eye through document

**3. Font Choices:**
- Sans serif fonts (Arial, Calibri) more readable on screens for most readers
- Serif fonts (Times New Roman) can reduce readability for those with visual impairments
- Optimal line length: 50-75 characters per line

**4. Bullets & Lists:**
- Improve scannability dramatically
- Highlight key points
- Break up dense paragraphs

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Teach design techniques]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- These are actionable techniques students can apply immediately
- Every technique serves readability—not decoration

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Headings: Readers scan headings first to decide what to read—make them descriptive and action-oriented
- White space: Not wasted space—it's breathing room that improves comprehension
- Font research: Recent studies favor sans serif for screen reading (most business documents read on screens)
- 50-75 characters per line: Too wide = eye strain; too narrow = choppy reading
- Bullets: Brain processes lists faster than paragraphs—use for parallel items

**Examples/Stories:**
- Compare: Email with single paragraph (300 words) vs. same email with 3 bullets highlighting key points
- Vietnamese context: Many Vietnamese business documents use Times New Roman (standard) but sans serif may improve readability

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Bullets are informal" → Clarify: Bullets are professional and improve comprehension
- "More text = more professional" → Reframe: Concise, well-spaced text = more professional

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the optimal line length range?" [Answer: 50-75 characters]
- "Why is white space important?" [Answer: Reduces overwhelm, guides eye, improves comprehension]

**Transition:**
- "Another critical skill: translating technical information for non-technical audiences..."

**Part 5: Technical Writing for Non-Technical Audiences**

---

**SLIDE 20: The Technical Translation Challenge**

TITLE: Why Technical Translation Matters

CONTENT:

**The Reality:**
- Most business decisions involve technical information but are made by non-technical leaders
- Engineers, data analysts, IT professionals must communicate with executives, marketers, clients
- Technical writers held 56,400 jobs in 2024 with median wage $91,670 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2024)

**The Goal:**
Facilitate knowledge transfer and informed decision-making by translating complexity into clarity.

**The Challenge:**
Non-technical readers don't have your depth of knowledge—you must scale back technical detail without losing accuracy.

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Technical translation is critical cross-functional skill
- Most students will work in environments requiring this skill

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Disconnect: Technical experts know too much; decision-makers know too little
- Translation bridges this gap—enables informed decisions
- Technical writing is profession ($91,670 median wage shows value)
- Goal: Knowledge transfer without overwhelming or oversimplifying
- Challenge: Finding right level of detail for audience

**Examples/Stories:**
- Example: Data scientist explaining machine learning model to marketing VP—focus on business outcomes (prediction accuracy, customer insights) not algorithm mechanics
- Vietnamese context: IT team at Viettel proposing 5G infrastructure to government officials—translate technical specs to coverage, speed, economic impact

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "If I simplify, I lose credibility" → Clarify: Clarity builds credibility; jargon destroys it
- Students fear looking less expert if they simplify → Reframe: True expertise is explaining complexity simply

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why would non-technical decision-makers need technical information?" [Answer: Make informed choices about investments, strategy, priorities]

**Transition:**
- "Let's learn specific techniques for technical translation..."

---

**SLIDE 21: Technical Translation Techniques**

TITLE: How to Translate Technical Information

CONTENT:

**Technique 1: Know Your Audience's Baseline**
- What does this reader already understand?
- What terms require definition vs. what's common knowledge?

**Technique 2: Use Analogies and Metaphors**
- Compare to concepts audience already knows
- "Blockchain is like a shared Google Doc that everyone can view but no one can edit retroactively"

**Technique 3: Focus on Outcomes, Not Mechanisms**
- Non-technical readers care about WHAT it does and WHY it matters
- Technical details support but don't lead

**Technique 4: Define Unavoidable Jargon Immediately**
- If technical term is necessary, define it in same sentence
- "We'll use API (Application Programming Interface)—essentially a way for two software systems to talk to each other"

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Teach translation techniques]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- These techniques work across all technical domains—IT, engineering, data science, finance
- Master these and you become valuable cross-functional communicator

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Baseline knowledge: Avoid over-explaining what audience knows or under-explaining what they don't
- Analogies: Same principle as leadership metaphors—translate abstract to concrete
- Outcomes vs. mechanisms: Executives care about business impact, not technical process
- Jargon definition: If you must use technical term, define it immediately in parentheses or clause
- Test: Give draft to non-technical friend—can they understand it?

**Examples/Stories:**
- Bad example: "Our RNN architecture uses LSTM cells with dropout regularization to mitigate overfitting"
- Good example: "Our AI model learns patterns from customer data to predict purchasing behavior with 87% accuracy, helping us send personalized recommendations"
- Vietnamese context: Fintech startup explaining cryptocurrency to traditional Vietnamese bankers—focus on use cases (fast transfers, low fees) not cryptographic algorithms

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Technical = credible" → Clarify: Comprehensible = credible
- Students think dumbing down = removing all technical terms → Correct approach: Define necessary terms, eliminate unnecessary ones

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between focusing on outcomes vs. mechanisms?" [Take response, then example: Outcome = "This software saves 5 hours/week"; Mechanism = "It uses Python scripts with automated data parsing"]

**Transition:**
- "Let's practice with a technical translation case study..."

---

**SLIDE 22: Case Study - Technical Translation**

TITLE: Before & After - Technical Writing for Executives

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: comparison-table -->

| ❌ Technical Version (For Engineers) | ✅ Translated Version (For CEO) |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| "Our new microservices architecture utilizes Kubernetes orchestration with Docker containerization, implementing REST APIs for inter-service communication and Redis caching to optimize query latency." | "Our new system design improves website speed by 40% and reduces server costs by $200K annually. It also makes our platform more reliable—if one component fails, others continue working, preventing site-wide outages that previously cost us $50K per hour in lost sales." |
| **Audience:** Technical team | **Audience:** CEO (cares about cost, speed, reliability, revenue impact) |
| **Language:** Jargon-heavy | **Language:** Outcome-focused, business terms |
| **Focus:** How it works | **Focus:** What it delivers and why it matters |

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Side-by-side comparison shows dramatic difference
- Both versions are accurate, but translated version gets CEO approval

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Technical version: Accurate but incomprehensible to CEO—lists technologies without context
- Translated version: Focuses on business outcomes (40% speed improvement, $200K savings, revenue protection)
- Translated version: Quantifies everything (CEO cares about numbers)
- Translated version: Still technically accurate—doesn't lie or oversimplify, just prioritizes what matters to audience
- Notice: Zero technical jargon in translated version—could add parenthetical definitions if needed, but not necessary here

**Examples/Stories:**
- Imagine you're CEO reading technical version—your reaction? Confusion, frustration, need to ask IT to translate
- Imagine reading translated version—clear decision: approve (saves money, increases speed, reduces risk)
- Vietnamese context: VNG presenting to investors—investors care about market share, growth, profitability, not coding languages

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Simplified version loses important information" → Clarify: Important TO WHOM? Information relevant to audience is included
- Students fear being accused of oversimplifying → Reframe: You're optimizing for audience

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What business outcomes are highlighted in translated version?" [Answer: 40% speed improvement, $200K cost savings, outage prevention saving $50K/hour]
- "Could you add technical details in appendix?" [Answer: Yes! Executive summary for CEO, technical appendix for CTO]

**Transition:**
- "Let's synthesize everything we've learned today..."

<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Synthesis & Application**

---

**SLIDE 23: Three Key Takeaways**

TITLE: What You've Learned Today

CONTENT:

**1. Purpose-Person-Point Framework (McCormack, 2024):**
Strategic writing starts with planning—clarify purpose, understand audience, state point within first 50 words.

**2. Executive Summaries Are Make-or-Break:**
Executives spend 5 minutes on summaries vs. 1-2 hours on full reports. Your summary must stand alone and drive action.

**3. How Great Leaders Write (Gallo, 2022):**
- Use short words for complex topics (credibility through clarity)
- Deploy sticky metaphors (abstract → concrete)
- Humanize data (relatable comparisons)
- Repeat core messages (under-communicate by 10x)

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Synthesize]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

**Start Now:** 3 weeks until presentations—apply today's frameworks to planning.

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Assessment bridge]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Explicitly bridge today's content to upcoming graded work
- Students should leave lecture knowing exactly how to apply learning

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Handout = executive summary of presentation—1 page max, standalone document
- Handout structure: Opening hook (presentation topic + why it matters), key findings, recommendations/insights, takeaway
- Slide design: Principles from today (headings, white space, visual hierarchy) prevent cluttered slides
- Research translation: If presenting academic research or data, use humanization and metaphor techniques
- Timeline: 3 weeks seems far but goes quickly—start applying frameworks during planning phase

**Examples/Stories:**
- Good handout example: 1-page summary with clear headings, bullets, white space—audience can follow along and reference later
- Bad handout example: Dense paragraphs, tiny font, no structure—gets ignored
- Vietnamese context: Professional presentations in Vietnamese companies often include handouts—this is standard business practice

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the maximum length for presentation handout?" [Answer: 1 page]
- "How can you apply Purpose-Person-Point to your presentation?" [Take 1-2 responses: Purpose = inform/persuade, Person = class + instructor priorities, Point = key message stated early]

2. **Which leadership communication principle resonates most with you?** (Short words, metaphors, humanizing data, or repetition?)

3. **What's one specific change you'll make to your writing after today's lesson?**

**Journal your responses—these insights will help you grow as a communicator.**

[PURPOSE: Reflection]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Pause for self-reflection—gives students time to internalize learning
- Reflection deepens retention and commitment to change

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Question 1: Most students probably jumped straight to drafting—validate this, then emphasize planning first (Purpose-Person-Point)
- Question 2: Different principles resonate with different people—all are valuable
- Question 3: Specific commitment increases likelihood of behavior change
- Journaling: Students should write responses, not just think—writing commits

**Facilitation:**
- Give genuine 2 minutes of silence for reflection
- Optional: Ask 1-2 volunteers to share responses (creates accountability)

**Transition:**
- "As you reflect, think about how these principles apply beyond this course to your entire professional career..."
