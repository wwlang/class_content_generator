## OPENING: Review & Assessment Preview (10 minutes)

### Quick Concept Review

**Cialdini's Six Principles of Persuasion:**
1. **Reciprocity** - People feel obligated to return favors
2. **Commitment & Consistency** - People want to be consistent with previous commitments

## MAIN ACTIVITY: Draft a Persuasive Proposal (55 minutes)

### The Scenario

You are a mid-level manager at **VietTech Solutions**, a Vietnamese software development company with 150 employees in Ho Chi Minh City. The company has been growing rapidly but facing a critical challenge: **high employee turnover** (35% annually, well above the industry average of 20%).

Exit interviews reveal that employees leave primarily due to:
- Lack of professional development opportunities (mentioned by 45% of departing employees)
- Feeling stagnant in their roles (38%)
- Better learning opportunities at competitor companies (52%)

Your CEO has asked department heads to propose solutions to the turnover problem. You believe implementing a **structured professional development program** could significantly reduce turnover and improve employee satisfaction.

**Your task:** Write a 1-page persuasive proposal to your CEO recommending a professional development program for VietTech Solutions employees.

**Note:** There are multiple valid approaches to this proposal. Focus on building a logical, evidence-based argument using the frameworks from this week's lecture.

---

### The Data

Use this information in your proposal:

**Current Situation:**
- VietTech turnover rate: 35% annually
- Industry average: 20% annually
- Cost per employee replacement: ~$15,000 USD (recruiting, onboarding, training, productivity loss)
- Total annual turnover cost: ~$787,500 (35% of 150 employees = 52.5 turnover × $15,000)
- Exit interview data available (see scenario above)

**Research Evidence You Can Cite:**

*LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report (2023):*
- 94% of employees would stay longer at companies investing in their development
- Professional development is the #1 factor in employee retention for millennials and Gen Z
- Companies with strong learning cultures have 30-50% higher retention rates

*Deloitte Human Capital Trends (2024):*
- ROI of employee development programs: For every $1 invested, companies see $4.50 return through improved productivity and reduced turnover
- Companies with structured development programs report 25% lower turnover

**Potential Program Components (choose what to propose):**
- Monthly lunch-and-learn sessions with industry experts
- Annual training budget per employee ($500-1,000 USD)
- Mentorship program pairing junior and senior developers
- Quarterly skill-building workshops (technical and soft skills)
- Support for external certifications (AWS, Google Cloud, Scrum Master, etc.)
- Internal knowledge-sharing platform
- Conference attendance allowance (1-2 per year per employee)

**Budget Considerations:**
- Your CEO is cost-conscious but understands the high turnover cost
- Vietnamese tech companies (competitors) are offering development programs
- You need to show ROI (return on investment)

---

### Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:**
- A 1-page persuasive proposal (can be in bullet format or paragraph format - your choice)
- Clearly structured using Problem-Solution-Benefit framework
- Explicitly applies at least 2 Cialdini principles (identify which ones you're using)

**Considerations:**
- **Problem section:** Use the data provided to create urgency. Quantify the cost of the problem.
- **Solution section:** Be specific about what you're proposing. Don't propose everything - choose 3-4 program components that work well together.
- **Benefit section:** Quantify expected benefits using the research provided. Show ROI clearly.
- **Cialdini principles:** Think about which principles fit naturally:
  - Social proof? (Other companies doing this, research showing effectiveness)
  - Authority? (Cite LinkedIn, Deloitte research)
  - Scarcity? (Cost of continuing to delay, losing employees to competitors)
  - Reciprocity? (Investing in employees creates loyalty)
- **Vietnamese context:** Consider cultural factors - Vietnamese employees value learning and advancement opportunities highly.
- **Ethics check:** Is your proposal transparent, truthful, and mutually beneficial?

**Remember:** Multiple valid approaches exist. Your reasoning and application of frameworks matter most.

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**Exchange your proposal with another pair.**

**Review using these criteria:**

**1. Problem-Solution-Benefit Structure:**
- [ ] Problem section clearly defines the issue with data/urgency
- [ ] Solution section presents specific recommendations
- [ ] Benefit section explains what the company/CEO gains
- [ ] Overall structure is logical and easy to follow

**2. Cialdini Principles Applied:**
- [ ] At least 2 Cialdini principles are explicitly identified and applied
- [ ] Principles are used appropriately (not forced)
- [ ] Application demonstrates understanding of the principles

**3. Evidence & Persuasiveness:**
- [ ] Proposal includes data/statistics to support claims
- [ ] Research cited appropriately (LinkedIn, Deloitte reports)
- [ ] Arguments are logical and convincing
- [ ] ROI or benefits are quantified (not just vague claims)

**4. Ethical Persuasion:**
- [ ] Proposal is transparent (no hidden agenda)
- [ ] Claims are truthful (data used accurately)
- [ ] Respects CEO's decision-making authority (doesn't manipulate)
- [ ] Focuses on mutual benefit (company and employees both gain)

**Provide feedback:**

**One specific strength:**
- "One strength I notice is [specific example]..."
- Example: "Your problem section is very strong - the $787,500 annual cost creates real urgency."

**One area to strengthen:**
- "One area to strengthen is [specific suggestion]..."
- Example: "Your benefit section could be stronger with more specific ROI calculations using the Deloitte data."

**Remember:** You're comparing approaches, not finding errors. Different strategies can work - focus on how clearly the frameworks are applied.

### Revision & Debrief (15 minutes)

**Revision (10 min):**
Based on peer feedback, strengthen your proposal. Focus on:
- Clarifying your problem-solution-benefit structure if needed
- Making Cialdini principle application more explicit
- Adding quantified benefits if missing
- Ensuring ethical persuasion (no manipulation)

**You don't need to change your overall approach** - if your reasoning is sound, just make it clearer and stronger.

**Debrief (5 min):**
