# Week 7 Tutorial: Tutor Notes

**Course:** Business Communication (BCI2AU)
**Tutorial:** Data Storytelling & Visualization
**Duration:** 90 minutes

---

## Tutorial Goals

- **Practice data storytelling skills** students will need for the Group Presentation (Week 11)
- **Apply ethical visualization principles** from the lecture to a realistic business scenario
- **Prepare for Quiz 2** covering Weeks 4-6 content (cross-cultural communication, AI tools, crisis communication)

## Key Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, students should be able to:
- Create visualizations that match data relationships (comparison → bar, trend → line, composition → pie)
- Support business recommendations with data-driven reasoning
- Design charts ethically (no truncated axes or misleading techniques)
- Provide constructive peer feedback using rubric criteria

## Quiz Solutions

### Question 1: Power Distance
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Hofstede's dimension measuring acceptance of hierarchical inequality
- Vietnam (high): Accept and expect hierarchy
- USA (low): Prefer flat structures

**Why wrong:**
- A: Confuses term with physical distance
- C: That's individualism/collectivism (different dimension)
- D: That's uncertainty avoidance (different dimension)

**Common confusion:** Students mix up Hofstede's six dimensions
**Teaching tip:** Create quick comparison table on board

### Question 2: High-Context Communication
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Meyer's framework: high-context = much left unsaid, read between lines
- Examples: Japan, Vietnam, China

**Why wrong:**
- A: That's LOW-context (opposite)
- C: Not the defining feature
- D: Not related to high/low context

**Teaching tip:** Vietnamese students understand intuitively. Example: "When Vietnamese person says 'maybe,' it often means 'no' but preserves relationship. Americans hear 'maybe' literally."

---

### Question 3: Cultural Adaptation
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
- Adapt TOWARD other culture's preferences
- When low-context person speaks to high-context audience, provide extra context to help bridge gap

**Why wrong:**
- A: Opposite of adaptation
- B: Avoidance, not adaptation
- D: Backwards (low-context prefers direct)

**Nuance note:** Can seem counterintuitive. Clarify: "You adapt your style to help THEM understand you, not expect them to adapt to you."

---

### Question 4: AI Limitations
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- AI can't assess appropriateness for relationship, cultural context, political implications
- This was main limitation emphasized in lecture

**Why wrong:**
- A: AI actually good at grammar
- C: AI works for many types of writing
- D: Many free options exist

**Teaching tip:** Students often think main weakness is factual errors (true, but different from contextual judgment).

---

### Question 5: AI Best Practice
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
- "AI-assisted" approach: AI drafts → human reviews/refines
- AI helps with blank page, alternatives
- Human adds judgment, context, authenticity

**Why wrong:**
- A: Too extreme
- B: Dangerous (errors, lacks context)
- D: Arbitrary distinction

**Analogy:** "Like calculator - helps, but YOU must understand problem and interpret answer."

---

### Question 6: AI Ethics
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Two concerns: (1) Transparency about AI use, (2) Misinformation (AI hallucinates)
- Both threaten trust/credibility

**Why wrong:**
- A: Too absolute (CAN be, not ALWAYS)
- C: Not true
- D: Extreme prediction, not from lecture

---

### Question 7: Crisis Elements
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Framework from lecture: Speed (respond before vacuum), Accuracy (factual), Empathy (show you care)

**Why wrong:**
- A: BAD tactics (what NOT to do)
- C: Silence dangerous
- D: May be part of response, but not the three foundational elements

**Common confusion:** Students think "accuracy" = wait for all info
**Clarify:** "Be fast with what you KNOW, transparent about what you DON'T know yet"

---

### Question 8: Initial Response Purpose
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
- First response goals: (1) Acknowledge awareness, (2) Show action, (3) Commit to updates
- Don't need complete information for this

**Why wrong:**
- A: Impossible in first hours
- B: Comes later (if at all)
- D: CYA approach damages trust

**Analogy:** "If friend asks 'Did you hear about the accident?' you don't say 'I'll respond when I have complete info.' You say 'Yes, looking into it, will update soon.'"

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

This activity prepares students for the Group Presentation where they'll need to find data, create visualizations, and support a recommendation. The scenario is deliberately open-ended—multiple conclusions are valid if well-reasoned. Students often expect one "right answer," so emphasize early that different teams will reach different recommendations and that's exactly what should happen in real business analysis.

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- Clear connection from data → reasoning → recommendation
- Chart types match data relationships (bar for comparison, line for trends, pie for composition)
- Ethical design: axes start at zero, titles state insights not just labels, no misleading techniques
- Written recommendation includes specific data points and acknowledges trade-offs or risks
- Professional tone with quantitative support

**Critical Moments:**

**During Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes):**

Around the 10-minute mark, check that pairs have identified their angle or story. If students seem stuck, prompt with questions like "What surprised you in the data?" or "If you were the CEO, what would you want to know?" rather than suggesting specific approaches. Watch for truncated axes or misleading techniques—don't tell them to fix it, but ask "What does your y-axis start at? What would happen if it started at zero?" and let them discover the issue. Vietnamese students may wait for the "right answer"—remind them there are multiple defensible conclusions.

**During Peer Review (15 minutes):**

Students should compare approaches, not find errors. Watch that they're using the rubric criteria rather than just saying "good job." If feedback is too vague, prompt: "Can you point to a specific example of that strength?" Vietnamese students may provide vague positive feedback to preserve harmony—encourage specificity by asking them to identify one concrete design choice that's effective and explain why.

**During Debrief (5 minutes):**

Select 2-3 pairs with different recommendations (expand now vs. wait vs. conditional) to share briefly. The key insight to draw out: despite different conclusions, all effective approaches share the same qualities—clear reasoning, appropriate visualizations, data backing, and honest design. This mirrors real business where smart people can reach different conclusions from the same data based on different priorities.

**Timing Flexibility:**

If time is tight, assign the quiz as homework with answers provided. This allows the full session for the data visualization activity, which is the core skill-building work. If rich discussion emerges during debrief, let it run—that's valuable learning.
