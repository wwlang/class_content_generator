## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome students to Week 7
- This week bridges analytical skills with communication skills
- Data is everywhere in business - knowing how to communicate it effectively is a critical professional skill

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Today we'll learn how to turn numbers and data into stories that persuade and inform
- We'll cover both the "science" (evidence-based design principles) and the "art" (storytelling) of data visualization
- By the end, you'll be able to create visualizations that are both accurate and compelling

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with a question that illustrates why this skill matters..."

---

**SLIDE 2: The Power of Visual Communication**

CONTENT:

**Question:** Why do 65% of people remember information when it's paired with a relevant image, but only 10% when it's text alone? (Medina, 2014)

**The Answer:** Our brains process visuals 60,000 times faster than text.

**What This Means for You:**
- In business, you'll often need to communicate complex data to busy decision-makers
- A well-designed chart can convey in seconds what might take paragraphs to explain
- Poor visualization can confuse, mislead, or lose your audience entirely

**Today's Challenge:** Learn to harness the power of visual communication ethically and effectively.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Ask the question and pause for students to think
- Many students underestimate how powerful visual communication is

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Our brains are wired to process visual information extremely quickly
- This is both an opportunity and a responsibility
- Opportunity: You can communicate complex ideas quickly
- Responsibility: You must ensure your visuals are accurate and not misleading

**Examples/Stories:**
- Show example: A good vs. bad visualization of the same data
- Good one tells clear story instantly; bad one confuses or misleads

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can anyone think of a time when a chart or graph helped you understand something complex?" [Take 1-2 responses]

**Transition:**
- "Before we dive into techniques, let's make sure we have the vocabulary to discuss data visualization..."

[PURPOSE: Vocabulary building]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- These terms will help us discuss data visualization with precision
- If you hear unfamiliar terms in readings or presentations, refer back to this slide

**Key Teaching Points:**
- "Data storytelling" is not just showing numbers - it's creating a narrative arc
- "Misleading visualization" can be intentional (unethical) or unintentional (poor design)
- "Accessibility" means everyone can access your information, including those with color blindness or visual impairments

**Cultural Note:**
- Vietnamese students may be more familiar with Excel than tools like Tableau or Power BI
- That's fine - these principles apply regardless of tool

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which of these terms is new to you?" [Show of hands]
- Focus explanation on terms students find unfamiliar

**Transition:**
- "Now let's look at what we'll accomplish by the end of today's lecture..."

[PURPOSE: Motivation & assessment alignment]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Today's lecture has two assessment connections: immediate and future"
- Immediate: Quiz 2 is this week (but covers previous weeks)
- Future: Group presentation will benefit hugely from today's content

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Quiz 2 focuses on Weeks 4-6, so today's content won't be on it
- However, you'll practice quiz question format in tutorial
- For your presentation, you'll likely need to show data about your topic
- Poor data visualization can undermine even the best arguments

**Real-World Context:**
- In professional settings, decision-makers often rely on data dashboards
- McKinsey, BCG, and top consulting firms emphasize data visualization skills
- Vietnamese companies increasingly value data-driven communication

**Transition:**
- "Let's begin with the foundation: how to turn data into a story..."

<!-- SECTION: CORE CONTENT - Data Storytelling -->

---

**SLIDE 6: What Is Data Storytelling?**

CONTENT:

**Definition:** Data storytelling is the practice of building a narrative around a set of data and its accompanying visualizations to help convey meaning to an intended audience.

**Why It Matters:**
- Data alone doesn't persuade - context and narrative do
- Decision-makers are busy: they need clear "so what?" insights
- Stories are 22 times more memorable than facts alone (Stanford GSB research)

**The Key Shift:**
- ❌ **Don't:** Just show charts and expect audience to figure it out
- ✅ **Do:** Guide your audience through data with a clear narrative

*Berinato, S. (2016). Visualizations that really work. Harvard Business Review, 94(6), 92-100. https://hbr.org/2016/06/visualizations-that-really-work*

[PURPOSE: Define concept]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Most people think data visualization is just making charts. That's only half of it."
- The other half is storytelling - giving data meaning and context

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Data storytelling combines three elements: data, visuals, and narrative
- All three are necessary - data without narrative is boring; narrative without data is unpersuasive
- The "22 times more memorable" statistic shows why storytelling matters

**Examples/Stories:**
- Bad example: A slide with 10 charts and no explanation
- Good example: A single chart with clear title, annotations, and "so what?" statement

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between data visualization and data storytelling?" [Visualization = charts; storytelling = charts + narrative + meaning]

**Transition:**
- "So how do you build a data story? There's a proven three-act structure..."

---

**SLIDE 7: The Three-Act Data Story Structure**

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

CONTENT:

**Act 1: Setup (The Context)**
- Establish the situation or question
- Provide necessary background
- Example: "Our customer satisfaction has been declining..."

**Act 2: Conflict (The Data)**
- Present the data that reveals the problem or opportunity
- Show the unexpected or important finding
- Example: "Analysis shows 65% of complaints are about response time..."

**Act 3: Resolution (The Insight)**
- Deliver the "so what?" - what does this mean?
- Provide recommendation or action
- Example: "By reducing response time to 24 hours, we can recover lost customers..."

**Key Principle:** Every data presentation should answer: Setup (What's happening?), Conflict (What's the data?), Resolution (What should we do?)

[PURPOSE: Teach framework]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This three-act structure comes from classic storytelling theory
- It works because our brains are wired to follow narratives with beginning, middle, end

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Act 1 (Setup)**: Don't assume audience knows the context - provide it
- **Act 2 (Conflict)**: This is where your data/charts appear - the "evidence"
- **Act 3 (Resolution)**: Never leave audience hanging - tell them what it means and what to do
- Many students forget Act 3 - they show data but don't interpret it

**Examples/Stories:**
- Walk through a business example: Company considering expansion to Vietnam
  - Act 1: We're evaluating market entry opportunities
  - Act 2: Vietnam's e-commerce market grew 25% in 2024 (show chart)
  - Act 3: We recommend entering within 12 months to capture growth

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Vietnamese students sometimes hesitate to make strong recommendations (cultural respect for hierarchy)
- Remind: "In business communication, stakeholders expect you to interpret data and recommend actions"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can someone give me an example of 'setup-conflict-resolution' from a presentation they've seen?" [Take 1 response]

**Transition:**
- "Now that we know how to structure a data story, let's look at a Vietnamese example..."

---

**SLIDE 8: Vietnamese Context: E-Commerce Growth Story**

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

CONTENT:

**Case Study: Vietnam's E-Commerce Boom**

**Setup:** Vietnam has one of the fastest-growing digital economies in Southeast Asia, driven by young, tech-savvy consumers.

**Conflict (The Data):**
- E-commerce revenue reached $20.5 billion in 2024 (VECOM, 2024)
- Mobile commerce accounts for 73% of online purchases
- Average order value increased 18% year-over-year
- Shopee and Lazada dominate, but TikTok Shop is gaining rapidly

**Resolution (The Insight):**
For businesses: Vietnam's e-commerce presents major opportunity, but competition is intense. Success requires mobile-first strategy and social commerce integration.

**Source:** Vietnam E-Commerce Association (VECOM) 2024 Report

[PURPOSE: Vietnamese application]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's see the three-act structure in action with a Vietnamese business case"
- This is the kind of data analysis you might present to a company considering Vietnam market entry

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Setup** gives context: Vietnam's digital economy is growing fast
- **Conflict** presents specific data: revenue, mobile share, growth rates
- **Resolution** interprets: What does this mean for businesses?
- Notice how the resolution doesn't just repeat the data - it adds insight

**Real-World Application:**
- Many Vietnamese students will work for companies entering Vietnam market or expanding within ASEAN
- Being able to tell data stories about local markets is valuable skill
- International companies value local employees who can interpret Vietnamese market data

**Cultural Note:**
- Vietnamese business culture is becoming increasingly data-driven
- Companies like VNG, Sendo, and Tiki all emphasize data analytics
- Your ability to communicate data effectively will set you apart

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between the 'conflict' data and the 'resolution' insight in this example?" [Conflict = raw numbers; resolution = interpretation and recommendation]

**Transition:**
- "Now we've got the storytelling framework. Next, we need to choose the right visuals..."

**Part 2: Choosing the Right Chart Type**

---

<!-- SECTION: Chart Selection Framework -->

---

**SLIDE 9: The Chart Selection Framework**

CONTENT:

**Core Principle:** Your chart type should match your data relationship and communication goal.

**Four Primary Data Relationships:**

1. **Comparison** → Use bar charts, column charts
   - Example: Comparing sales across regions

2. **Composition** → Use pie charts, stacked bars, tree maps
   - Example: Market share breakdown

3. **Distribution** → Use histograms, box plots
   - Example: Customer age distribution

4. **Relationship/Correlation** → Use scatter plots, bubble charts
   - Example: Relationship between price and sales volume

**The Wrong Chart Confuses; The Right Chart Clarifies.**

*Berinato, S. (2016). Visualizations that really work. Harvard Business Review, 94(6), 92-100. https://hbr.org/2016/06/visualizations-that-really-work*

[PURPOSE: Teach selection framework]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "One of the most common mistakes in data visualization: using the wrong chart type"
- Example: Showing trends over time with a pie chart (wrong!) instead of line chart (right!)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Before choosing a chart, ask: "What relationship am I showing?"
- Different relationships require different chart types
- This framework from Berinato (HBR 2016) is industry standard

**Examples for Each Type:**
- **Comparison**: "Which region had the highest sales?" → Bar chart
- **Composition**: "What's our market share?" → Pie chart
- **Distribution**: "How are our customers distributed by age?" → Histogram
- **Relationship**: "Does higher price correlate with higher quality ratings?" → Scatter plot

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using pie charts for more than 5-6 categories (too cluttered)
- Using 3D charts (they distort perception)
- Using line charts for non-sequential data

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If I want to show how company revenue has changed over the past 5 years, which data relationship is that?" [Trend over time - use line chart]

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at specific examples of when to use each chart type..."

---

**SLIDE 10: Chart Types: When to Use What**

<!-- LAYOUT: comparison-table -->

CONTENT:

| **Chart Type** | **Best For** | **Avoid When** |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Bar/Column** | Comparing values across categories | Showing trends over time (use line instead) |
| **Line** | Showing trends over time | Comparing discrete categories (use bar instead) |
| **Pie** | Showing parts of a whole (max 5-6 slices) | Comparing values, showing trends |
| **Scatter Plot** | Showing correlation between two variables | One variable only (use histogram) |
| **Table** | Precise values matter, lookup reference | Showing trends or patterns (use chart) |

**Key Rule:** Simplicity beats complexity. If viewers need to study your chart for 30+ seconds, redesign it.

[PURPOSE: Practical guide]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Here's a quick reference guide for chart selection"
- Keep this in mind when creating your presentation slides

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Bar/Column**: Great for comparison, easy to read
- **Line**: Best for time series, shows trends clearly
- **Pie**: Only use for simple part-of-whole (market share, budget breakdown)
- **Scatter**: Shows if two things are related (correlation)
- **Table**: When precise numbers matter more than visual patterns

**"Avoid When" is Critical:**
- Many people use pie charts incorrectly (too many slices, comparing instead of showing composition)
- Line charts require sequential data (time, order, progression)

**Simplicity Rule:**
- Edward Tufte (data visualization expert): "Above all else, show the data"
- Don't add unnecessary decorations, 3D effects, or complex colors
- If it takes too long to understand, it's too complex

**Check for Understanding:**
- Show two charts of same data - one good, one overly complex
- "Which one communicates better? Why?"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's talk about making your charts not just correct, but excellent..."

**SLIDE 11: Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures**

CONTENT:

From Rougier, Droettboom, & Bourne (2014), *PLOS Computational Biology*:

**Key Rules for Business Communication:**

**1. Know Your Audience**
- Technical audience vs. executive audience require different detail levels

**2. Identify Your Message**
- Every figure should have ONE clear message

**3. Adapt the Figure to the Support Medium**
- Slides need larger fonts than reports

**4. Use Color Effectively**
- Color should add information, not just decoration
- Consider color-blind accessibility (8% of men, 0.5% of women)

**5. Do Not Mislead the Reader**
- Start axes at zero (unless there's a good reason)
- Keep proportions accurate

**6. Avoid "Chartjunk"**
- Remove unnecessary grid lines, decorations, 3D effects

*Rougier, N. P., Droettboom, M., & Bourne, P. E. (2014). Ten simple rules for better figures. PLOS Computational Biology, 10(9), e1003833. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833*

[PURPOSE: Evidence-based principles]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These ten rules come from peer-reviewed research on effective data visualization"
- We'll focus on the six most relevant for business communication

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Rule 1 (Audience)**: Executives want high-level insights; analysts want detailed data
- **Rule 2 (Message)**: If you can't state the message in one sentence, refine your figure
- **Rule 3 (Medium)**: Slides viewed from distance need larger text than printed reports
- **Rule 4 (Color)**: Use color to highlight, not just make pretty. Test for color-blind accessibility
- **Rule 5 (Don't Mislead)**: Most common mistake is truncated y-axis to exaggerate trends
- **Rule 6 (Chartjunk)**: Edward Tufte's term for unnecessary visual elements

**Examples:**
- Show example of misleading chart with truncated axis
- Show same data with proper axis - trend looks less dramatic but more honest

**Cultural Note:**
- Vietnamese business presentations sometimes favor decorative designs
- International business standards favor simplicity and clarity
- When presenting to global audiences, err on side of simplicity

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why is it important to start the y-axis at zero?" [To avoid exaggerating trends and misleading audience]

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at a specific example of how color can help or hurt your visualization..."

---

**SLIDE 12: Color: Your Powerful Tool or Worst Enemy**

CONTENT:

**Use Color To:**
✅ Highlight important data points
✅ Group related items
✅ Show categorical differences
✅ Guide viewer's attention

**Avoid:**
❌ Using too many colors (limit to 5-6)
❌ Relying only on color to convey information (accessibility!)
❌ Using red/green together (8% of men are red-green color blind)
❌ Random/decorative color choices

**Best Practice:**
- Use one primary color + shades for emphasis
- Add patterns or labels in addition to color
- Test your chart in grayscale - can you still understand it?

**Tools:** ColorBrewer (colorbrewer2.org) provides color-blind safe palettes.

[PURPOSE: Practical color guidance]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Color is like salt in cooking - essential, but easy to overuse"
- Most students either use too much color or not enough

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Strategic color use**: Highlight what matters most (example: one bar in red, others in gray)
- **Grouping**: Use same color family for related items
- **Accessibility is not optional**: 8% of men have some form of color blindness
- **The grayscale test**: If your chart doesn't work in black and white, you're relying too much on color

**Examples:**
- Show chart with too many colors (confusing)
- Show same data with strategic color (one accent color highlights key finding)

**Tools Recommendation:**
- ColorBrewer.org - free tool with accessibility-safe color palettes
- Most data viz tools (Tableau, Power BI) have built-in accessible palettes

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Vietnamese design aesthetics sometimes favor bright colors and decorative elements
- For business/international audiences, restrained color use signals professionalism

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the problem with using red and green together in a chart?" [Red-green color blindness makes them indistinguishable]

**Transition:**
- "Color is one way charts can mislead. Let's talk about the ethics of data visualization..."

**Part 4: Ethics - Avoiding Misleading Visualizations**

---

<!-- SECTION: Ethical Visualization -->

---

**SLIDE 13: The Ethics of Data Visualization**

CONTENT:

**Core Principle:** With the power to visualize data comes the responsibility to represent it accurately.

**Common Ways Visualizations Mislead:**

1. **Truncated Axes** - Starting y-axis above zero to exaggerate differences
2. **Cherry-Picked Data** - Showing only the time period or subset that supports your claim
3. **Inappropriate Chart Types** - Using 3D pie charts that distort perception
4. **Misleading Scales** - Making small differences look huge
5. **Omitting Context** - Showing percentages without showing base numbers

**Your Responsibility:**
As a business communicator, your credibility depends on trustworthy data presentation. One misleading chart can undermine your entire reputation.

[PURPOSE: Emphasize ethics]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Data visualization is powerful - and with power comes responsibility"
- You can make the same data tell completely different stories depending on how you visualize it

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Truncated axes** is the most common form of misleading visualization
  - Example: Stock price chart starting at $95 instead of $0 makes 5% increase look like 500%
- **Cherry-picking data**: Showing only Q4 results when full year was poor
- **3D charts**: Perspective distorts size - front slices of pie look bigger than back slices
- **Scale manipulation**: Using different scales for related charts
- **Missing context**: "90% increase!" sounds impressive until you learn it's from 10 to 19 customers

**Real-World Stakes:**
- Misleading visualizations can lead to bad business decisions
- In some industries (finance, pharmaceuticals), misleading data visualization can be illegal
- Your professional reputation is built on trust - lose it once, hard to regain

**Ethical Reflection:**
- "Sometimes pressure to make results look good. Resist."
- "Always ask: Am I making this decision-maker see reality, or my preferred reality?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- Show example of misleading chart, then accurate version
- "Which one is honest? Which one would you want to base a business decision on?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at real examples of misleading visualizations and how to fix them..."

---

**SLIDE 14: Case Study: Misleading vs. Accurate Visualization**

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

CONTENT:

**Example: Sales "Growth" Visualization**

**Misleading Version:**
- Y-axis starts at $950,000 (not zero)
- Sales appear to triple over 6 months
- Uses 3D column chart with dramatic perspective
- No context about industry trends

**Accurate Version:**
- Y-axis starts at $0
- Sales increased 5.3% over 6 months
- Uses simple 2D column chart
- Includes industry benchmark (competitors grew 4%)
- Interpretation: "We're growing slightly faster than industry average"

**The Lesson:**
Same data, different stories. The misleading version makes results seem more impressive but loses credibility when examined. The accurate version is less dramatic but builds trust.

**Question to Consider:** Would you rather be impressive or trustworthy?

[PURPOSE: Concrete example]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Here's a real example (anonymized) of how the same data can be visualized honestly or dishonestly"
- This happens frequently in business - you need to recognize it

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Misleading version** uses all the tricks: truncated axis, 3D distortion, no context
- **Accurate version** follows the "Ten Simple Rules": starts at zero, 2D, includes context
- The difference in interpretation is huge: "tripling sales" vs. "5.3% growth above industry average"
- Both are technically showing the same data, but the story changes

**Decision-Making Impact:**
- If you're a manager viewing the misleading chart, you might think everything's great
- If you're viewing the accurate chart, you understand the real situation: modest outperformance
- Which one leads to better business decisions?

**Your Role:**
- When creating visualizations: Choose accuracy over impression
- When evaluating visualizations: Look for these red flags (truncated axes, missing context, 3D effects)

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Sometimes pressure in Vietnamese business culture to "save face" or make results look good
- Remember: Honest communication builds long-term trust, even if short-term results are less impressive

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If you were presenting to your CEO, which version would you use? Why?" [Discuss ethics vs. pressure]

**Transition:**
- "Now let's talk about practical tools you can use to create good visualizations..."

---

**SLIDE 15: Tools for Data Visualization**

CONTENT:

**Free/Accessible Tools:**

**Microsoft Excel**
- ✅ Widely available, familiar interface
- ✅ Good for basic charts (bar, line, pie)
- ❌ Limited interactivity and advanced features

**Google Sheets**
- ✅ Free, cloud-based, collaborative
- ✅ Similar functionality to Excel
- ❌ Slower with large datasets

**Canva**
- ✅ User-friendly, great templates
- ✅ Good for infographics and social media
- ❌ Less suitable for complex data analysis

**Advanced Tools (Free Versions Available):**
- **Tableau Public** - Interactive dashboards
- **Power BI** - Microsoft's business intelligence tool
- **Flourish** - Animated, interactive visualizations

**Recommendation for Your Presentation:** Start with Excel or Google Sheets. They're sufficient for most business communication needs.

[PURPOSE: Practical tools]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

- "You don't need expensive software to create effective visualizations"
- Most of you already have access to Excel or Google Sheets

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Excel**: Most common in Vietnamese businesses. Learn it well.
- **Google Sheets**: Great for group work (real-time collaboration)
- **Canva**: Popular for making things look polished, but not for serious data analysis
- **Tableau/Power BI**: If you're going into data-heavy roles, worth learning

**For Your Group Presentation:**
- Excel or Google Sheets will be sufficient
- Focus on applying principles (right chart type, clear message, no misleading) rather than fancy tools
- A simple, clear chart beats a complex, confusing one every time

**Learning Resources:**
- YouTube has excellent Excel chart tutorials
- LinkedIn Learning (free through many universities) has Tableau courses

**Vietnamese Job Market:**
- Excel proficiency is expected in most business roles

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's review the five key principles from today's lecture"
- These should guide every data visualization you create

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Emphasize that all five work together
- You can have perfect chart type but still fail if you mislead
- You can follow all design rules but still fail if you don't tell a story

**Reinforcement:**
- "Which of these five is most challenging for you?" [Show of hands for each]
- Common answer: Storytelling (students comfortable with charts but struggle with narrative)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Tutorial today has two parts: quiz prep and hands-on visualization practice"
- Both are important for your success this week and beyond

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Quiz 2 prep**: Even though today's lecture is about data visualization, Quiz 2 covers Weeks 4-6
- You'll get practice questions in quiz format to prepare
- **Visualization practice**: You'll apply everything we learned today
- Work with partner to create charts and give each other feedback

**Preparation:**
- Bring laptop if possible (can share with partner if needed)
- Start thinking about what data you might need for your group presentation
  - Example: If presenting about sustainability, might need environmental statistics
  - Example: If presenting about Vietnamese market trends, might need market data

**Activity Structure:**
- You'll receive a dataset
- Your task: Tell a data story using appropriate visualizations
- Peer review: Partner evaluates using today's principles
- Iterate: Improve based on feedback

**Transition:**
- "Speaking of your presentation, let's talk about how today's skills connect to that assessment..."

**SLIDE 18: Assessment Bridge: Your Group Presentation**

CONTENT:

**How Today's Content Helps Your Presentation:**

**For Your Presentation (Week 11):**
- Most topics benefit from data support
  - Market size and growth trends
  - Customer demographics
  - Competitive analysis
  - Impact metrics

**Quality Data Visualization Will:**
✅ Strengthen your arguments with evidence
✅ Make complex information quickly understandable
✅ Demonstrate analytical and communication skills
✅ Increase your credibility with the audience

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
❌ Too many charts (data overload)
❌ Charts without clear interpretation
❌ Misleading visualizations that damage credibility
❌ Overly complex charts that confuse rather than clarify

**Recommendation:** Plan your data strategy now. What data do you need? How will you visualize it?

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "In 4 weeks, you'll be presenting to the class. Start thinking now about your data strategy."
- Data visualization can make or break a business presentation

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Most presentation topics need data**: Even if not obvious at first
  - Example: "Digital marketing strategy" → needs data on market size, audience demographics, ROI
  - Example: "Workplace diversity" → needs data on current state, benefits, best practices
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have 2-3 excellent charts than 10 mediocre ones
- **Always interpret**: Never show a chart without explaining what it means
- **Credibility risk**: One misleading chart can undermine entire presentation

**Planning Advice:**
- This week or next: Identify what data you'll need
- Week 8-9: Create and refine your visualizations
- Week 10: Finalize slides with data integrated into narrative

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Vietnamese business presentations sometimes use excessive data/charts
- International best practice: selective data that supports specific claims
- Think: "What's the minimum data needed to make my point convincingly?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at all the sources we've referenced today..."
