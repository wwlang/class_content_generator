**Course:** Business Communication (BCI2AU)
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**What you'll do:**
- Apply data storytelling principles to a realistic business scenario
- Create and critique visualizations using evidence-based design principles

## Part 1: Data Visualization Activity (55 minutes)

### The Scenario

You're consultants advising **Cà Phê Sài Gòn**, a Vietnamese coffee chain with 6 locations in Hanoi. The CEO asks: Should we expand to Thanh Xuân district? If so, what strategy should we pursue?

**Your task:** Create 2-3 visualizations that tell a data story supporting your recommendation.

**Note:** Different teams may reach different conclusions (expand, wait, expand conditionally, etc.) - all can be valid with strong reasoning.

### The Data

**Store Performance (Monthly Revenue in VNĐ millions):**
- Hoàn Kiếm (traditional area): 85M

- Ages 50+: 7%

**Product Mix (% of revenue):**
- Traditional Vietnamese coffee: 35%

### Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:**
- 2-3 charts (Excel, Google Sheets, or hand-sketched)
- Written recommendation (1 paragraph) using setup-conflict-resolution structure

**Considerations:**
- What story does the data tell you? (Identify your angle first)
- Which data relationships support your story? (comparison, trend, composition, correlation)
- Match chart types to relationships: comparison → bar, trend → line, composition → pie
- Design principles: clear titles stating insights, axes at zero, limited colors, no 3D effects
- Multiple valid recommendations exist - focus on connecting data to reasoning

---

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**Exchange work with another pair.**

**Review using these criteria:**
- [ ] Appropriate chart types for data relationships shown
- [ ] Clear titles that communicate insights (not just "Revenue" or "Demographics")
- [ ] Ethical design (no truncated axes, no misleading techniques)
- [ ] Professional appearance (clean, labeled, accessible)
- [ ] Story follows setup-conflict-resolution structure
- [ ] Recommendation well-supported by data

**Provide feedback:**
- One specific strength: "Your line chart title 'Customer Satisfaction Rising 17%' immediately communicates the insight"
- One area to strengthen: "Consider starting your y-axis at zero to avoid exaggerating the revenue difference"

**Remember:** You're comparing approaches, not finding errors. Different recommendations can both be strong.

---

### Revision & Debrief (15 minutes)

**Revision (10 min):** Refine your work based on feedback. You don't need to change your recommendation - strengthen your reasoning and design.

**Debrief (5 min):** Class discussion on different approaches and what made them effective.
