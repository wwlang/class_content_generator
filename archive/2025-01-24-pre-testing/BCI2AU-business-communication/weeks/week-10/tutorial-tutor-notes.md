## Quiz 3 Solutions

**Coverage:** Weeks 7-9 (Data Storytelling & Visualization, Business Reports & Executive Communication, Presentations Part I - Design & Structure)

**Format:** 10 multiple choice questions (Remembering and Understanding levels)

**Duration:** 30 minutes maximum (if students finish early, they can begin delivery practice preparation)

### Question 1: Data Storytelling Arc

According to the data storytelling framework, what are the three essential components of a data narrative?

A) Introduction, body, conclusion
B) Setup, conflict, resolution ← **CORRECT**
C) Problem, analysis, recommendation
D) Context, data, interpretation

**Why B is correct:**
The data storytelling arc follows narrative structure: Setup (context and baseline), Conflict (the problem or change revealed by data), Resolution (what the data tells us to do or conclude). This is explicitly taught in Week 7 lecture Slide covering data storytelling frameworks.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Too generic - doesn't capture the narrative tension of storytelling
- C: Standard business structure but not specific to data storytelling arc
- D: Elements of data presentation but not the storytelling arc framework

**Common confusion:** Students may confuse general business writing structure with data storytelling arc
**Teaching tip:** Emphasize that data storytelling uses narrative techniques (conflict creates engagement) rather than just presenting information

### Question 2: Chart Selection

Which chart type is most appropriate for showing how a single value (like revenue) changes over time?

A) Pie chart
B) Scatter plot
C) Line chart ← **CORRECT**
D) Bar chart

**Why C is correct:**
Line charts are specifically designed to show trends over time. The continuous line emphasizes the progression and direction of change. This is covered in Week 7 chart selection framework.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Pie charts show parts of a whole at a single point in time (not change over time)
- B: Scatter plots show relationships between two variables (correlation), not change over time
- D: Bar charts CAN show change over time but are better for comparing discrete categories; line charts better emphasize continuous trends

**Common confusion:** Students sometimes use bar charts for time series data (acceptable but not optimal)
**Teaching tip:** "Line = time" is a helpful mnemonic. Ask: "If you wanted to show stock price changes over a year, which chart?" (line)

### Question 3: Misleading Visualizations

What visualization technique is most commonly used to mislead audiences?

A) Using too many colors
B) Manipulating the Y-axis scale ← **CORRECT**
C) Including too much data
D) Using 3D effects

**Why B is correct:**
Truncating or manipulating the Y-axis scale can exaggerate small changes to appear dramatic. For example, starting Y-axis at 95 instead of 0 makes a change from 96 to 98 look huge. Week 7 explicitly covers this as the #1 misleading technique.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Poor design choice but not actively misleading (just cluttered)
- C: Reduces clarity but doesn't actively deceive
- D: Can distort perception but less commonly used to mislead than axis manipulation

**Common confusion:** Students think all visualization mistakes are "misleading" vs. intentionally deceptive
**Teaching tip:** Show example: Same data with Y-axis 0-100 (shows small change) vs. Y-axis 95-100 (looks dramatic)

### Question 4: Accessibility in Data Visualization

Why is color choice important for accessibility in data visualizations?

A) It makes charts look more professional
B) Color is easier to remember than shapes
C) Approximately 8% of men have color vision deficiency ← **CORRECT**
D) Color attracts more attention than black and white

**Why C is correct:**
Week 7 specifically discusses accessibility and notes that ~8% of men (and 0.5% of women) have color vision deficiency, most commonly red-green. Using color alone to convey information excludes these users. Must use patterns, labels, or shapes in addition to color.

**Why wrong:**
- A: True but not the accessibility reason
- B: Not necessarily true and not the accessibility concern
- D: May be true but not the accessibility reason

**Common confusion:** Students think accessibility is just about "looking good"
**Teaching tip:** Have students look at a red-green visualization through a color blindness simulator (online tools available)

### Question 5: Executive Summary Purpose

According to the Purpose-Person-Point framework (Week 8), what should an executive summary do FIRST?

A) Provide detailed methodology
B) State the main conclusion or recommendation ← **CORRECT**
C) Give background context
D) List all findings

**Why B is correct:**
The Purpose-Person-Point framework emphasizes starting with the bottom line (conclusion/recommendation) because executives are busy and need to know "what should I do?" immediately. Week 8 lecture explicitly states "Don't bury your conclusion on page 12."

**Why wrong:**
- A: Methodology goes in appendix or body, not executive summary opening
- C: Brief context is OK but AFTER stating main conclusion
- D: Key findings included but AFTER main conclusion stated

**Common confusion:** Vietnamese communication style often builds context before conclusion; Western business writing expects conclusion first
**Teaching tip:** "Busy executives want the answer first, then decide if they need to read details"

### Question 6: Technical Writing for Non-Technical Audiences

When writing technical information for non-technical audiences (Week 8), what should you do?

A) Use simpler words and explain jargon ← **CORRECT**
B) Include all technical details so they can learn
C) Avoid data and focus only on stories
D) Write the same way but add a glossary

**Why A is correct:**
Week 8 teaches that technical writing for non-technical audiences requires translating jargon into plain language and explaining necessary technical terms. The goal is comprehension, not education in the technical field.

**Why wrong:**
- B: Overwhelming non-technical readers defeats communication purpose
- C: Data is important but must be presented accessibly (charts, analogies)
- D: Glossary helps but doesn't solve problem of dense technical prose

**Common confusion:** Students think "simplifying" means "dumbing down" (it actually means clarifying)
**Teaching tip:** "You're translating, not teaching a course. Use analogies and plain language."

### Question 7: Document Visual Hierarchy

What is the purpose of visual hierarchy in business reports (Week 8)?

A) To make documents look more professional
B) To guide readers' attention to most important information ← **CORRECT**
C) To fill white space on the page
D) To meet formatting requirements

**Why B is correct:**
Visual hierarchy uses size, weight, color, and position to signal importance and guide the reader's eye to key information first. Week 8 discusses this as essential for scannable documents. Headers, bold text, white space all create hierarchy.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Side benefit but not the purpose
- C: Opposite - white space is PART of visual hierarchy (gives readers' eyes rest)
- D: Formatting requirements don't explain WHY hierarchy matters

**Common confusion:** Students think visual hierarchy is just about aesthetics
**Teaching tip:** Show two versions of same content: one wall of text, one with clear hierarchy. Ask which is easier to scan.

### Question 8: Nancy Duarte's Presentation Structure

According to Nancy Duarte's "What is / What could be" structure (Week 9), what creates tension in a presentation?

A) Using complex data
B) Contrasting current reality with future possibility ← **CORRECT**
C) Asking the audience questions
D) Showing problems without solutions

**Why B is correct:**
Duarte's structure alternates between "what is" (current unsatisfactory reality) and "what could be" (better future state). This contrast creates emotional tension that motivates audience to embrace the change/solution being proposed. Week 9 covers this as storytelling framework.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Complexity can confuse but doesn't create motivating tension
- C: Questions engage but aren't the core of Duarte's structure
- D: Shows problems but doesn't show possibility (missing half of the framework)

**Common confusion:** Students confuse Duarte's structure with simple problem-solution format
**Teaching tip:** "Duarte ping-pongs between reality and vision - that back-and-forth creates energy"

### Question 9: The Rule of Three in Presentations

Why is the "rule of three" effective in presentations (Week 9)?

A) Three is the lucky number in most cultures
B) Human brain naturally organizes information in groups of three ← **CORRECT**
C) Presentations should be exactly three parts
D) Three slides per minute is the optimal pace

**Why B is correct:**
Week 9 teaches that cognitive research shows people naturally remember and process information in groups of three. "Three main points" is easier to recall than two or four. Examples: "Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness" or "Stop, drop, and roll."

**Why wrong:**
- A: Cultural belief but not the cognitive science reason
- C: Misinterpretation - rule of three is about content grouping, not strict structure
- D: Not related to the rule of three concept

**Common confusion:** Students think it's a hard rule rather than cognitive principle
**Teaching tip:** "Can you remember three things better than seven? That's why: 3 main points, 3 supporting examples, 3 benefits."

### Question 10: Avoiding "Death by PowerPoint"

Which slide design principle helps avoid "Death by PowerPoint" (Week 9)?

A) Use at least 10 bullet points per slide
B) Read slides verbatim so audience doesn't miss anything
C) Minimize text - slides support, not replace, your spoken words ← **CORRECT**
D) Include detailed paragraphs for people who weren't at the presentation

**Why C is correct:**
Week 9 explicitly teaches that slides should complement spoken words, not duplicate them. Too much text causes cognitive overload (audience reads OR listens, can't do both). Minimal text + visuals + spoken explanation = effective presentation.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Opposite of best practice (causes cognitive overload)
- B: "Death by PowerPoint" IS when people read slides verbatim
- D: That's what a handout is for (separate from presentation slides)

**Common confusion:** Students think detailed slides = helpful; actually detailed slides = ignored while speaker talks
**Teaching tip:** "Your slides are billboards, not documents. Big ideas, minimal words, visual support."

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

Students are one week away from their Group Presentations (15 min + 10 min Q&A). This practice activity is deliberately focused on delivery techniques because slides should be nearly finalized by now. The emphasis is on vocal variety (5 P's) and executive presence (body language) - both explicitly evaluated in the Individual Presentation rubric. The activity is structured so students practice, receive specific feedback, and immediately revise based on that feedback (active learning cycle). Vietnamese students may feel self-conscious about presenting, so the pair format (vs. full class) lowers anxiety while still providing valuable practice.

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- **Vocal variety evident:** Noticeable variation in pitch (not monotone), strategic pauses before/after key points, pace variation (slow for emphasis, slightly faster for transitions), clear projection
- **Body language confident:** Open posture (shoulders back, not slouched), eye contact with partner (if in person) or camera (if virtual), purposeful gestures (emphasizing key points), grounded stance (not shifting weight)
- **Authentic delivery:** Natural communication style enhanced by techniques (not robotic or over-performed)
- **Feedback specific:** Partner identifies WHICH technique was used well and WHICH needs improvement with concrete examples ("Your pause before the statistic was very effective" not "good job")
- **Improvement visible in Round 2:** Student applies at least ONE piece of feedback in second delivery

**Critical Moments:**

**During Individual Preparation (10 minutes):** Students may struggle to identify 2-3 places to use specific techniques. Circulate and ask guiding questions: "Where in your segment could you slow down for emphasis?" or "What's the most important point where a pause would help?" Some students will try to rehearse full presentation - redirect them to focus on just one 2-3 minute segment. Vietnamese students may be hesitant to plan gestures (cultural norm is minimal hand movement) - encourage them gently: "For international audiences next week, moderate gestures show confidence. Let's identify just 2-3 moments where a hand gesture could emphasize your point."

**During Round 1 Practice (15 minutes):** This is where anxiety may surface - some students will speak too fast or become overly self-conscious. Remind observing partners: "Your job is to notice what your partner does WELL first, then identify one specific improvement." Monitor for partners who give vague feedback ("it was good") - prompt them: "What specific moment showed good vocal variety? Can you point to one technique?" After both partners have presented once, do a quick pulse check: "How many of you are noticing things you want to improve already?" Normalize this - "That's exactly the point of practice!"

**During Round 2 Revised Delivery (10 minutes):** Watch for students who implement feedback successfully - you'll see visible improvement (e.g., student who spoke in monotone in Round 1 now varies pitch, student who avoided eye contact now makes deliberate contact). Point out these improvements publicly if student is comfortable: "I noticed [Name] really worked on pausing before statistics in Round 2 - much more impactful!" Some students may feel discouraged if improvement is small - remind them that even 10% improvement in delivery can significantly affect audience perception and grades.

**During Group Debrief (8 minutes):** Invite volunteers to share what they learned. Expect responses like "I didn't realize I speak so fast when nervous" or "Pausing feels awkward to me but my partner said it helped." Validate both observations. Emphasize: "The techniques that feel weird to you often look natural to your audience." Draw out Vietnamese cultural context if it arises: "Some of you may have learned that minimal gestures and indirect eye contact show respect - that's true in Vietnamese social contexts. In international business presentations, direct eye contact and moderate gestures signal confidence and credibility. You're learning to code-switch between cultural communication norms." Address common question about authenticity: "These techniques enhance your natural style, they don't replace it. You'll still sound like you - just a more polished, confident version."

**During Q&A Practice with PREP (7 minutes):** Prepare 8-10 challenging questions related to typical business presentation topics. Examples: "How would your solution work in a recession?", "What if your budget is cut by 50%?", "Why should we choose your approach over competitors?", "How does this apply specifically to Vietnam's market conditions?" Call on pairs and ask one question. The answering student should use PREP structure OUT LOUD. Partner confirms whether all four components were included (Point, Reason, Example, Point restate). If student forgets a component, gently prompt: "Good point and reason - can you give us a specific example?" Watch for students who ramble or don't answer the question - this reveals they need more Q&A prep this week. Remind class: "In Week 11, you have 10 minutes of Q&A. Your rubric evaluates your ability to handle questions with confidence. Practice likely questions with your team this week using PREP."

**Timing Flexibility:**

If Quiz 3 takes longer than expected (some students may use full 30 minutes), you have two options: (1) Shorten Individual Preparation to 7 minutes and Round 1 Practice to 12 minutes (still gives adequate practice), or (2) Assign the delivery practice for homework - students pair up outside class, record themselves on Zoom, and exchange feedback via email or Zoom chat. The quiz prep is non-negotiable this week, so protect that time. If students finish quiz early (20-25 minutes), immediately start delivery practice prep - they can begin selecting their 2-3 minute segment and identifying technique application points while waiting for classmates to finish.
