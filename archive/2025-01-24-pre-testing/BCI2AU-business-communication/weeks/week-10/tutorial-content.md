## Opening: Quiz 3 Review & Delivery Prep (10 minutes)

### Today's Focus

**Two major activities:**

1. **Quiz 3 (Weeks 7-9):** 30 minutes
   - 25-30 multiple choice questions
   - Covers Data Storytelling (Week 7), Business Reports (Week 8), Presentations Design (Week 9)
   - Does NOT include today's Week 10 delivery content

2. **Delivery Practice (60 minutes):**
   - Practice 2-3 minutes of your Week 11 presentation
   - Focus on vocal variety (pitch, pace, pause, projection, passion)
   - Apply executive presence techniques (posture, eye contact, gestures)
   - Receive structured peer feedback on delivery

**Why this matters:**

Your rubrics evaluate delivery techniques explicitly:
- "Confident, engaging, natural delivery with eye contact, body language, and vocal variety"
- "Outstanding application of vocal variety and executive presence"

Today you practice these skills in low-stakes environment before next week's graded presentations.

## MAIN ACTIVITY: Presentation Delivery Practice (60 minutes)

### The Challenge

You have one week until your Group Presentation. Your slides are (mostly) done. Now you need to practice DELIVERY.

**Your task:** Deliver 2-3 minutes of your presentation focusing on delivery techniques, receive peer feedback, and revise your approach.

**Note:** There's no "perfect" delivery style - authenticity matters most. Focus on techniques that enhance your natural communication style.

---

### Part 1: Individual Preparation (10 minutes)

**Prepare a 2-3 minute segment from your Week 11 presentation.**

**Choose one of these segments:**
- Your opening (hook + preview)
- One core content section with key framework/data
- Your closing (call-to-action + final thought)

**Preparation checklist:**

- [ ] Select 2-4 slides you'll present
- [ ] Review the 5 P's (Pitch, Pace, Pause, Projection, Passion)
- [ ] Identify 2-3 places to use strategic pauses
- [ ] Note where you'll vary pitch for emphasis
- [ ] Plan 2-3 purposeful gestures
- [ ] Decide where you'll make eye contact (if in person) or look at camera (if virtual)

**Consider:**
- Where will you slow down for emphasis?
- Where will you speed up for energy?
- What's your opening gesture? Closing gesture?
- How will you show enthusiasm for your topic?

---

### Part 2: Practice Delivery in Pairs (25 minutes)

**Find a partner. You'll each deliver your 2-3 minute segment twice.**

**Round 1: First Delivery (15 minutes total)**

**Presenter A** (3 min delivery + 4 min feedback):
- Deliver your 2-3 minute segment
- Focus on applying ONE vocal technique and ONE body language technique
- Partner B observes using feedback form below

**Presenter B** (3 min delivery + 4 min feedback):
- Same process

**Feedback Form (Partner uses this):**

**Vocal Variety:**
- Pitch: Did speaker vary tone or speak in monotone?
- Pace: Was speed appropriate? Too fast/slow anywhere?
- Pause: Did speaker use strategic pauses effectively?
- Projection: Could you hear clearly? Good volume?
- Passion: Did speaker convey enthusiasm?

**Body Language:**
- Posture: Open or closed? Confident stance?
- Eye contact: Maintained or avoided?
- Gestures: Purposeful or distracting/absent?
- Energy: Engaged or low energy?

**One strength (be specific):**
"One thing you did really well was..."

**One area to improve (be specific):**
"One technique to strengthen would be..."

---

**Round 2: Revised Delivery (10 minutes total)**

**Both presenters deliver again (2-3 min each), applying feedback from Round 1.**

**Focus:** Implement ONE improvement based on partner's feedback.

**Quick feedback (1 min each):**
"I noticed you improved..."

---

### Part 3: Group Debrief & Q&A Practice (15 minutes)

**Class Discussion (8 minutes):**

**Tutor will facilitate discussion:**

- What delivery technique felt most challenging to apply?
- Which technique made the biggest difference when you tried it?
- What feedback did you receive that surprised you?
- How will you adjust your delivery for next week?

**Q&A Practice with PREP Method (7 minutes):**

**Scenario:** Tutor asks each pair one challenging question related to typical presentation topics.

**Your task:** Answer using PREP method:
- **Point:** State your answer directly
- **Reason:** Explain why
- **Example:** Provide specific example
- **Point:** Restate your answer

**Example Question Types:**
- "How does your solution address [specific concern]?"
- "What if your timeline/budget is cut in half?"
- "Why should we choose your approach over alternatives?"
- "How does this apply to the Vietnamese market specifically?"

**Practice:** One person from each pair answers one question using PREP. Partner observes and confirms structure was followed.

---

### Part 4: Final Reflection & Next Steps (10 minutes)

**Individual Reflection (5 minutes):**

Answer these questions (journal or mental notes):

1. **Vocal Variety:** Which of the 5 P's do I need to practice most before next week?
2. **Body Language:** What's my biggest delivery weakness based on today's feedback?
3. **Improvement Plan:** What ONE technique will I focus on when I practice this week?
4. **Recording Plan:** When will I record my practice this week to check improvement?

**Tutor Closes with Key Reminders (5 minutes):**

**Before Week 11 Presentations:**
- Practice your full presentation 3-5 times (not just once!)
