## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Vietnamese students learning in English need this vocabulary foundation
- These terms will appear throughout today's lecture and in your rubrics

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Executive presence = phong thái lãnh đạo (leadership demeanor/style)
- Vocal variety is NOT just speaking louder - it's strategic variation
- Projection vs. volume: projection includes clarity and enunciation, not just loudness
- Credibility signals = both what you do (body language) and how you sound (vocal)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate monotone vs. varied pitch with same sentence
- Show effective pause: "Our revenue increased by... [pause] ...300%"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can someone give an example of when a pause would be effective in a presentation?"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's see why mastering delivery matters for your success..."

**SLIDE 3: The Presentation Paradox**

TITLE: The Presentation Paradox

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

"When it comes to communication, what matters most is not what you say but how you say it."

— Research on financial spokespersons (2012)

[LAYOUT: quote-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inspire]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This finding surprises many students who focus only on content

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Research analyzed 120 financial spokespersons presenting to investors
- Found that passion (27%), voice quality (23%), and presence (15%) mattered MORE than content (15%)
- This doesn't mean content doesn't matter - it means delivery determines whether your content is heard
- The same message delivered differently produces completely different results

**Examples/Stories:**
- Think of two professors: one with brilliant ideas delivered in monotone, one with good ideas delivered passionately
- Which class do you remember? Which concepts stick with you?

**Common Misconceptions:**
- Students think "I just need good slides and I'll be fine"
- Reality: Great slides + poor delivery = forgettable presentation

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Think of a presentation you remember well. Was it the content or the delivery that made it memorable?"

**Transition:**
- "So if delivery matters this much, what specific techniques make the difference? Let's start with your voice..."

**Part 1: Vocal Variety - Your Most Powerful Tool**

---

**SLIDE 4: The 5 P's of Vocal Variety**

TITLE: The 5 P's of Vocal Variety

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Pitch:** The highs and lows of your vocal tone - avoid monotone

**Pace:** Speed of speech - vary to emphasize and maintain engagement

**Pause:** Strategic silence - use before/after key points for emphasis

**Projection:** Volume and clarity - ensure you're heard and understood

**Passion:** Enthusiasm and energy - convey genuine engagement with topic

[LAYOUT: framework-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Write "5 P's" on board as mnemonic device
- These five elements work together to create engaging delivery

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Pitch: Everyone has vocal range (higher and lower notes) - use it!
- Pace: Speed up for excitement, slow down for emphasis
- Pause: Most underused technique - silence creates impact
- Projection: Not shouting - it's about breath support and clarity
- Passion: Authentic enthusiasm is contagious

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate same sentence five times, varying one P each time
- Example: "This year our company achieved record growth"
  - Monotone (boring)
  - Vary pitch on "record" (emphasis)
  - Slow pace on entire sentence (gravitas)
  - Pause before "record growth" (anticipation)
  - Full passion (excitement)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which P do you think you naturally use well? Which do you need to work on?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down each of these techniques with specific strategies..."

---

**SLIDE 5: Pitch - Breaking the Monotone**

TITLE: Pitch - Breaking the Monotone

CONTENT:

**The Problem:**
A monotone voice bores the audience, and a bored audience is less likely to recall key points or take action.

**The Solution:**
Use your vocal range - the ups and downs of your voice when speaking.

**When to Vary Pitch:**
- **Questions:** Natural upward inflection ("What would you do?")
- **Emphasis:** Lower pitch for authority ("This is critical")
- **Lists:** Vary pitch for each item to maintain interest
- **Emotional moments:** Match pitch to content (excitement = higher, seriousness = lower)

**Practice Tip:**
Record yourself and listen - do you sound like you're reading or conversing?

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Ask: "How many of you have sat through a boring lecture where the professor spoke in one tone?"
- That's the monotone trap - even interesting content becomes forgettable

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Everyone has natural pitch variation in conversation - we just lose it when nervous
- Monotone = one pitch level throughout (sounds robotic or bored)
- Vietnamese speakers: Be aware that Vietnamese is a tonal language (6 tones) but English uses pitch differently for emphasis, not word meaning
- In English presentations, pitch variation shows emotion and emphasis

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate: "Our revenue grew 300% this quarter" in monotone vs. with pitch emphasis on "300%"
- Vietnamese context: When presenting in English to international audiences, pitch variation signals confidence (not showing off)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Varying pitch sounds fake" → Only if exaggerated; natural variation sounds conversational
- "Professional = serious tone" → Professional = clear and engaging

**Check for Understanding:**
- Have students practice saying "This solution will save millions" with different pitch on "millions"

**Transition:**
- "Pitch variation adds color to your voice. Now let's talk about speed..."

---

**SLIDE 6: Pace - Strategic Speed Control**

TITLE: Pace - Strategic Speed Control

CONTENT:

**Optimal Pace:** 140-160 words per minute for presentations (slightly slower than normal conversation)

**When to Speed Up:**
- Introducing familiar concepts
- Building excitement or energy
- Transitioning between topics
- Storytelling action sequences

**When to Slow Down:**
- Introducing new or complex concepts
- Sharing critical data or statistics
- Before your call-to-action
- During your main message

**Common Mistake:**
Speaking too fast when nervous - your audience can't process information at that speed.

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Raise your hand if you've ever felt yourself speeding up during a presentation because you're nervous"
- This is the #1 delivery problem - anxiety makes us rush

**Key Teaching Points:**
- 140-160 words/minute = conversational pace for clarity
- Normal conversation = 150-180 wpm, so presentations should be SLIGHTLY slower
- When you're nervous, you might hit 200+ wpm (too fast to understand)
- Pace variation = rhetorical tool (fast = energy, slow = importance)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate: Read a complex sentence at 200 wpm (too fast) then at 140 wpm (clear)
- Vietnamese context: Vietnamese speakers sometimes speak English faster than they realize because Vietnamese syllable timing differs from English stress-timed rhythm

**Cultural Considerations:**
- In Vietnam, speaking quickly can signal intelligence/education
- In international business presentations, speaking too quickly signals nervousness or lack of confidence
- Slow, clear speech = confidence and respect for audience

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If you're sharing a statistic - '67% of customers said...' - should you speed up or slow down?"
- Answer: Slow down for emphasis and comprehension

**Transition:**
- "But the most powerful vocal technique isn't about speed or pitch - it's about silence..."

---

**SLIDE 7: Pause - The Power of Strategic Silence**

TITLE: Pause - The Power of Strategic Silence

CONTENT:

**Why Pause Works:**
- Allows audience time to process important information
- Creates anticipation before key points
- Signals "this matters - pay attention"
- Gives you time to breathe and reset

**When to Pause:**
- **Before key statistics:** "Our results showed... [pause 2-3 seconds] ...a 300% increase"
- **After asking questions:** Give audience time to think
- **During transitions:** Signal shift to new topic
- **After your main message:** Let it land

**Practice the 3-Second Rule:**
Three seconds of silence feels long to you but natural to your audience.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "I'm going to demonstrate something uncomfortable..." [Pause for 5 seconds while looking at class]
- "That felt like forever to me, but probably natural to you. That's the power of the pause."

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Pause = most underutilized technique (we fear silence)
- Research: 2-3 second pauses give audience processing time without feeling awkward
- Pauses also help YOU - they give you time to breathe, think, check your notes
- Best used BEFORE or AFTER significant points, not randomly

**Examples/Stories:**
- Compare: "Last quarter revenue increased 250%" (rushed)
- With pause: "Last quarter, revenue increased... [pause] ...250%" (dramatic)
- Show TED talk clip where speaker uses effective pause (if available)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Pausing makes me look like I forgot something" → Pausing confidently makes you look thoughtful
- "I need to fill every second with words" → Silence is content too

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese communication sometimes avoids long pauses (discomfort with silence)
- In international presentations, pauses signal confidence and control
- Western audiences especially appreciate pauses for processing complex information

**Check for Understanding:**
- Have 2-3 students deliver this line with effective pause: "The solution is simple... [pause] ...we need to act now"

**Transition:**
- "Pitch, pace, and pause control what you say. Now let's talk about being HEARD..."

---

**SLIDE 8: Projection & Passion**

TITLE: Projection & Passion - Being Heard and Felt

CONTENT:

**Projection ≠ Just Volume**

**Projection includes:**
- **Volume:** Loud enough for back row to hear comfortably
- **Clarity:** Enunciate consonants and complete words
- **Breath support:** Speak from diaphragm, not throat
- **Energy:** Voice carries your enthusiasm

**Passion - The Authenticity Factor:**
- Show genuine enthusiasm for your topic
- If YOU don't care, why should your audience?
- Passion is contagious - energy generates energy
- Authentic beats "perfect" every time

**Quick Fix:**
Stand up straight, breathe from your belly, and project to the back wall.

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Projection isn't about yelling - it's about energy and clarity"
- Demonstrate: Say "Good morning" loudly (harsh) vs. projected (clear, energized)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Projection = filling the room with clear sound using breath support
- Poor posture = weak voice (slouching compresses diaphragm)
- Good posture + deep breathing = natural projection
- Passion must be AUTHENTIC - forced enthusiasm feels fake

**Examples/Stories:**
- Compare two versions of same opening:
  - Flat: "Today I'll talk about our new product" (no passion)
  - Energized: "Today I'm excited to share a product that will transform how you work" (passion)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I have a quiet voice naturally" → Projection is a skill you can develop with practice and breath control
- "Showing passion is unprofessional" → Passion shows you care about your work (very professional)

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students sometimes perceive energetic delivery as "showing off"
- In international contexts, passion = competence and commitment
- Balance: Authentic enthusiasm without being over-the-top

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Try this: Take a deep breath from your belly, stand tall, and say 'This matters' loud enough for the back row to hear clearly"

**Transition:**
- "Your voice is your instrument. But your body language speaks even louder..."

**SLIDE 9: What is Executive Presence?**

TITLE: What is Executive Presence?

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

"Executive presence is your ability to project mature self-confidence, a sense you can take control of difficult, unpredictable situations, make tough decisions in a timely way, and hold your own with other talented and strong-willed members of the executive team."

— Sylvia Ann Hewlett, Executive Presence (2014)

[LAYOUT: quote-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inspire]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Executive presence sounds abstract, but it's a specific set of learnable behaviors"
- This isn't about being naturally charismatic - it's about strategic communication

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Executive presence = leadership credibility (how leaders carry themselves)
- Components: Appearance, behavior, and communication
- Today we focus on communication elements: vocal and physical presence
- You don't need a job title to demonstrate executive presence

**Examples/Stories:**
- Think of someone you find credible and authoritative when they present
- What specific behaviors signal their credibility? (Eye contact, posture, vocal confidence)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Who comes to mind when you think of someone with strong executive presence? What do they do differently?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down the specific credibility signals you can use..."

---

**SLIDE 10: The ABC's of Executive Presence**

TITLE: The ABC's of Executive Presence

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Appearance:** How you present yourself through dress, grooming, and posture

**Behavior:** Your actions, demeanor, and how you carry yourself under pressure

**Communication:** Verbal structure, vocal delivery, and non-verbal signals

**For presentations, focus on:**
- Body language (posture, gestures, eye contact)
- Vocal presence (tone, pacing, projection, variety)
- Communication coherence (alignment between words and body language)

[LAYOUT: framework-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The ABC's framework breaks executive presence into observable, improvable components"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Appearance: Professional dress appropriate for context (for you: business casual minimum for presentations)
- Behavior: How you handle unexpected questions, technical difficulties, nerves
- Communication: This is where you have most control in presentations
- Communication coherence = your words match your body language (critical for credibility)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Incoherent communication: Saying "I'm confident about this" while avoiding eye contact and fidgeting (body contradicts words)
- Coherent communication: "This is an important decision" with direct eye contact and steady posture

**Research:**
- UCLA research: When verbal and non-verbal messages conflict, people trust the non-verbal by a factor of 13:1
- Your body language will ALWAYS win over your words if they don't match

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If you say 'I'm excited about this opportunity' but your arms are crossed and you're looking at the floor, what will your audience believe?"
- Answer: The body language (you're not actually excited)

**Transition:**
- "Let's get specific about body language techniques..."

---

**SLIDE 11: Body Language Credibility Signals**

TITLE: Body Language Credibility Signals

CONTENT:

| Credible Body Language ✓ | Undermining Body Language ✗ |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Open posture:** Stand tall, shoulders back, arms uncrossed | **Closed posture:** Slouching, crossed arms, turning away |
| **Strong eye contact:** 3-5 seconds per person/section of room | **Avoiding eyes:** Looking at floor, ceiling, or only notes |
| **Purposeful gestures:** Hand movements that emphasize points | **Fidgeting:** Playing with pen, adjusting clothes, rocking |
| **Grounded stance:** Feet shoulder-width, weight balanced | **Shifting weight:** Swaying, pacing without purpose |
| **Confident facial expressions:** Smile, engagement, authenticity | **Blank expression:** No emotion, seeming disinterested |
| **Strategic movement:** Move to emphasize transitions | **Frozen or chaotic:** Standing rigid or moving randomly |

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Your body is communicating even when you're silent"
- Research shows audiences assess credibility within 7 seconds based on non-verbal cues

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Open posture signals confidence and honesty (arms open = metaphorically "nothing to hide")
- Eye contact: In groups, make contact with different sections (3-5 seconds each person/area)
- Purposeful gestures enhance message; random gestures distract
- Grounded stance = stability and confidence; shifting = nervousness or uncertainty

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate: Deliver same sentence twice
  - First: Slouched, arms crossed, looking down → "Our solution is the best choice"
  - Second: Open posture, eye contact, gestures → "Our solution is the best choice"
  - Ask: "Which version did you believe more?"

**Cultural Considerations (Critical for Vietnamese Students):**
- **Eye contact:** In Vietnamese culture, extended eye contact with elders/superiors can signal disrespect
- **In international presentations:** Direct eye contact = confidence and honesty (not disrespect)
- **Strategy:** In Week 11 presentations to international/diverse audiences, use Western eye contact norms
- **Gestures:** Vietnamese communication often uses minimal hand gestures; international audiences expect moderate gestures for emphasis

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Gestures feel fake" → Start small; they'll feel natural with practice
- "I should stand perfectly still" → Some movement is good (emphasizes transitions, shows energy)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Practice right now: Stand up, open posture, and say 'I'm ready to lead this project' with confident body language"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's talk about what to do when your body language betrays your nerves..."

**74%**

of people experience speech anxiety - you're not alone

Even experienced presenters get nervous. The difference? They've learned to manage it.

[LAYOUT: big-number-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inspire]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Before we talk about techniques, I want to normalize something: nervousness is NORMAL"
- Show of hands: "How many of you feel nervous before presentations?"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- 74% of people fear public speaking (glossophobia)
- This includes experienced speakers, executives, even professional presenters
- Nervousness ≠ incompetence (it means you care about doing well)
- Goal isn't to eliminate nerves - it's to manage them productively

**Examples/Stories:**
- Share personal story: "I still get nervous before presentations, even after X years of teaching"
- Famous speakers who've admitted to nervousness: Warren Buffett (took Dale Carnegie course), Richard Branson, etc.

**Reframing:**
- Anxiety = adrenaline = energy you can channel into enthusiastic delivery
- "I'm nervous" → "I'm energized and ready"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What physical symptoms do you experience when nervous?" (rapid heartbeat, sweating, shaky voice)
- "These are normal - let's learn to work with them, not against them"

**Transition:**
- "Here are research-backed techniques to manage that nervous energy..."

---

**SLIDE 13: Evidence-Based Anxiety Management Techniques**

TITLE: Evidence-Based Anxiety Management Techniques

CONTENT:

**Before Your Presentation:**

1. **Breathing Exercises:** Deep diaphragmatic breathing calms nervous system (4-7-8 technique: inhale 4 counts, hold 7, exhale 8)
2. **Visualization:** Vividly imagine successful delivery - your brain associates presenting with positive emotions
3. **Physical Exercise:** Movement on presentation day reduces anxiety and stress
4. **Practice Out Loud:** Rehearse 3-5 times to build muscle memory and confidence

**During Your Presentation:**

5. **Reframe Anxiety:** "I'm nervous" → "I'm excited and energized"
6. **Use Pauses:** When you feel rushed, pause - gives you time to breathe and reset
7. **Focus on Message:** Shift attention from "How am I doing?" to "How can I help my audience?"
8. **Ground Yourself:** Feel your feet on the floor, stand in strong posture

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These aren't just tips - they're research-backed techniques proven to reduce anxiety"
- Emphasize: Practice these BEFORE Week 11, not the night before

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **4-7-8 breathing:** Activates parasympathetic nervous system (calms you physiologically)
- **Visualization research:** Athletes and executives use this - imagining success creates neural patterns similar to actual success
- **Exercise:** Even 10 minutes of movement reduces cortisol (stress hormone)
- **Reframing:** Research shows labeling anxiety as "excitement" improves performance (same physiological response, different interpretation)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate 4-7-8 breathing right now in class (have students try it)
- Visualization exercise: "Close your eyes. Imagine yourself next week, delivering your presentation confidently. See the audience nodding, smiling. Feel yourself speaking clearly. Hear the applause at the end."

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may feel uncomfortable admitting nervousness (loss of face)
- Normalize it: "Even the most successful professionals use these techniques"
- Frame as performance optimization, not weakness management

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "These techniques are crutches" → They're professional tools used by elite performers
- "I just need to push through fear" → Managing anxiety improves performance AND experience

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which technique will you try before your Week 11 presentation?"
- "Let's practice 4-7-8 breathing together now"

**Transition:**
- "Managing anxiety helps you deliver well. But what happens when the presentation is over and questions begin?"

**Part 4: Mastering Q&A Sessions**

---

**SLIDE 14: Why Q&A Matters**

TITLE: Why Q&A Matters

CONTENT:

**Q&A is where credibility is truly tested.**

**Your presentation shows:** What you prepared
**Your Q&A shows:** What you know

**Research Finding:**
Presenters who handle Q&A confidently are rated 30% higher in expertise and credibility than those who struggle with questions (Goulston, 2020).

**For Week 11:**
Your group presentation includes 10 minutes of Q&A (40% of total presentation time). The rubric evaluates your Q&A handling skills.

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Persuade]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Many students think Q&A is less important than the presentation - the opposite is true"
- Q&A often determines whether your audience trusts your expertise

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Presentation = controlled, rehearsed (you know what's coming)
- Q&A = unpredictable, tests real knowledge and thinking
- Credibility boost: Answering confidently shows mastery beyond slides
- Your Week 11 rubric specifically evaluates Q&A performance (Time Management & Q&A criterion)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Real scenario: Two students present equally good content
  - Student A: Handles Q&A confidently, directly, with examples
  - Student B: Fumbles, says "I don't know" to most questions
  - Who gets the higher grade? Who would you hire?

**Research:**
- Goulston's HBR research: Q&A confidence correlates with perceived expertise
- Audiences often remember Q&A responses more than presentation content (it's personalized interaction)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How many of you have been in presentations where the Q&A was more memorable than the slides?"

**Transition:**
- "So if Q&A is this important, what's the strategy? Let's break it down..."

**SLIDE 15: The Q&A Framework - PREP Method**

TITLE: The Q&A Framework - PREP Method

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**P - Point:** State your main answer directly and concisely

**R - Reason:** Explain why (rationale or evidence)

**E - Example:** Provide specific example or data point

**P - Point (Restate):** Reinforce your main answer

**Example Question:** "How will this strategy work in the Vietnamese market?"

**PREP Answer:**
- **Point:** "This strategy is well-suited for Vietnam's mobile-first market"
- **Reason:** "Because 85% of Vietnamese consumers shop via mobile devices"
- **Example:** "For instance, Lazada Vietnam increased conversion 45% using mobile-optimized checkout"
- **Point:** "So yes, this mobile-first strategy aligns perfectly with Vietnamese consumer behavior"

[LAYOUT: framework-slide]
[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The PREP method gives you a structure so you never ramble or freeze"
- Write "PREP" on board as students take notes

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Point first:** Don't bury your answer - state it upfront (unlike storytelling where you build to conclusion)
- **Reason:** One clear reason is better than three weak ones
- **Example:** Specifics build credibility (vague examples sound made up)
- **Restate point:** Reinforces your answer and signals you're done

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate BAD answer (rambling): "Well, um, Vietnam is interesting, and mobile is growing, and I read somewhere that people use phones a lot, so maybe it could work, I think..."
- Demonstrate GOOD answer using PREP (as shown in slide)

**Practice:**
- Give students question: "Why should we invest in this project?"
- Have 2-3 volunteers answer using PREP structure

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I need to give long, detailed answers" → Concise and structured beats long and rambling
- "I should repeat the question first" → Optional; only do this if audience couldn't hear question

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese communication often builds context before conclusion
- International Q&A expects direct answer first (Point), then supporting details
- This isn't rude - it's efficient and respectful of time

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What are the four steps of PREP?"
- "Try answering this question using PREP: 'How does this apply to Vietnam?'"

**Transition:**
- "PREP handles straightforward questions. But what about difficult ones?"

**You Don't Know the Answer:**
✓ "That's a great question. I don't have that data at hand, but I'll research it and follow up with you."
✗ "I don't know" [and nothing else]

**The Hostile Question:**
✓ "I appreciate your concern. Let me address that..." [stay calm, reframe negatively]
✗ Getting defensive or arguing

**The Off-Topic Question:**
✓ "Interesting question, though outside today's scope. Let's connect after to discuss."
✗ Spending 5 minutes on tangent

**The Multi-Part Question:**
✓ "You asked three things - let me address each: First..." [tackle one at a time]
✗ Trying to answer everything at once (and forgetting parts)

**The Vague Question:**
✓ "Can you clarify what you mean by [ambiguous term]?" [ask for specificity]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These are the question types that make people panic - but each has a professional response"
- Key principle: Honesty + professionalism always wins

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Don't know:** Saying "I don't know but I'll find out" is MORE credible than making something up
- **Hostile:** Stay calm (you lose if you get emotional); acknowledge concern, then reframe
- **Off-topic:** Redirect politely (protects your time and keeps presentation on track)
- **Multi-part:** Break down into parts (shows you're listening carefully)
- **Vague:** Clarifying questions are professional (don't guess)

**Examples/Stories:**
- **Hostile example:** Q: "This seems expensive and risky. Why should we trust this?"
  - Bad: "It's not risky! You're wrong!"
  - Good: "I understand cost is a concern. Let me show you the ROI analysis that addresses exactly that..."
- **Multi-part example:** Q: "What about budget, timeline, and team size?"
  - Good: "Three important questions. On budget: [answer]. On timeline: [answer]. On team size: [answer]."

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may fear saying "I don't know" (loss of face)
- In professional Western contexts, "I don't know but I'll find out" signals integrity
- Making up an answer and being wrong = much bigger loss of credibility

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I must answer every question perfectly" → Honesty when you don't know is perfectly acceptable
- "Hostile questions are attacks" → Often they're legitimate concerns phrased poorly

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If someone asks a hostile question, what's your first response?" (Stay calm, acknowledge concern)
- Role play: Have student ask hostile question, another student respond professionally

**Transition:**
- "All these Q&A techniques assume in-person presentations. But what about virtual?"

CONTENT:

<!-- LAYOUT: comparison-table -->

| In-Person Presentations | Virtual Presentations |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Eye contact:** Look at individuals in room | **Eye contact:** Look directly at camera (not screen) |
| **Body language:** Full body visible, use space | **Body language:** Upper body only; frame yourself well |
| **Energy level:** Natural conversational energy | **Energy level:** Increase energy 10-15% (camera flattens) |
| **Audience feedback:** See nods, confusion, engagement | **Audience feedback:** Limited cues; check chat/reactions |
| **Pacing:** Read the room and adjust | **Pacing:** Slow down slightly (harder to process remotely) |
| **Environment:** Controlled venue | **Environment:** Must control lighting, background, sound |

**Key Insight:** Virtual presenting requires MORE intentional energy and technique, not less.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Many students think virtual presenting is easier - it's actually harder"
- You lose most audience feedback and must compensate with technique

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Camera = eye contact:** Looking at screen feels natural but looks like you're looking down to audience
- **Framing:** Top of head to mid-chest; position camera at eye level
- **Energy:** Camera flattens energy by 10-15%, so you must amplify to appear "normal"
- **Pacing:** Slow down more than in-person (visual cues limited, so comprehension takes longer)
- **Environment:** Poor lighting/background/sound undermines credibility instantly

**Examples/Stories:**
- Show two video clips (if available):
  - Poor virtual presenting: Looking at screen, dim lighting, cluttered background, low energy
  - Good virtual presenting: Looking at camera, good lighting, clean background, energized
- Demonstrate: Talk to screen (looks disengaged) vs. talk to camera (looks engaged)

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students often present from home (family noise, limited space)
- Professional standard: Find quiet space, use virtual background if needed, test setup
- Headphones with mic often improve audio quality significantly

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Virtual is more casual" → Virtual requires MORE preparation (technology, environment)
- "People understand if there are technical issues" → Some do, but it still undermines credibility

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the #1 mistake people make in virtual presentations?" (Looking at screen instead of camera)
- "Why should you increase your energy in virtual settings?" (Camera flattens energy)

**Transition:**
- "Let's get specific about virtual setup..."

---

**SLIDE 18: Virtual Presentation Technical Setup**

TITLE: Virtual Presentation Technical Setup

CONTENT:

**Lighting:**
- Face a window OR use desk lamp in front of you
- Avoid backlighting (window behind = silhouette)
- Goal: Face clearly visible, no harsh shadows

**Camera Position:**
- Eye level (stack books under laptop if needed)
- Arm's length away (about 50-70cm)
- Frame: Top of head to mid-chest visible

**Audio:**
- Use headphones with microphone (much better than laptop mic)
- Test in advance - bad audio kills credibility
- Mute when not speaking if background noise

**Background:**
- Clean, professional, uncluttered
- Virtual backgrounds OK if stable (avoid weird glitches)
- Avoid busy/distracting backgrounds

**Internet:**
- Wired connection if possible (more stable than WiFi)
- Close other programs/tabs (conserve bandwidth)
- Have backup plan (phone hotspot if internet fails)

**Practice Before Week 11:**
Record yourself and watch - you'll see what to improve.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Technical setup isn't optional - it's part of your professional presentation"
- Poor setup = audience focuses on technical problems, not your message

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Lighting:** Natural light from window is best (free and flattering)
- **Camera eye level:** Looking down at camera makes you look less authoritative; looking up is unflattering
- **Audio quality:** #1 complaint in virtual meetings (more important than video quality)
- **Background:** Messy = unprofessional; clean = credible
- **Internet stability:** Test before presentation, have backup ready

**Examples/Stories:**
- Show example (if possible): Same person with bad setup vs. good setup (dramatic difference in credibility)
- Real scenario: Student's internet failed during presentation - used phone hotspot as backup (prepared = professional)

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may share living space with family (hard to control noise/background)
- Solutions: Present from cafe with WiFi, use university library/computer lab, schedule presentation when home is quiet
- Virtual backgrounds acceptable if computer handles them smoothly

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "People will understand if I have technical problems" → Maybe, but your grade/credibility suffers
- "My laptop camera is fine" → Often it's at wrong angle and has poor audio

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the most important audio tip?" (Use headphones with microphone)
- "Where should your camera be positioned?" (Eye level, arm's length away)

**Practical Activity:**
- "This week, record a 1-minute practice using these setup tips. Watch it and identify one improvement to make before Week 11."

**Transition:**
- "Technical setup handles the 'how to be seen and heard.' Now let's talk about engaging virtual audiences..."

---

**SLIDE 19: Engaging Virtual Audiences**

TITLE: Engaging Virtual Audiences

CONTENT:

**The Virtual Attention Challenge:**
Remote audiences lose attention after 10 minutes (vs. 15-20 minutes in-person) - they're often multitasking.

**Engagement Strategies:**

1. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Polls/quizzes every 7-10 minutes
   - Ask questions and invite chat responses
   - Use virtual whiteboard for brainstorming

2. **Vocal & Visual Energy:**
   - Increase vocal variety (monotone kills virtual engagement)
   - Use gestures (visible on camera)
   - Show enthusiasm - energy is contagious

3. **Eye Contact with Camera:**
   - Periodically look at camera and smile
   - Creates feeling of personal connection

4. **Leverage Chat:**
   - Monitor chat for questions (assign team member if group)
   - Acknowledge chat comments ("Great point in chat, Lan!")

5. **Shorter Content Chunks:**
   - Break content into 5-8 minute segments
   - Transition clearly between segments

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The hardest thing about virtual presenting? You can't see if people are engaged or checking email"
- You must build engagement INTO your presentation, not hope for it

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Attention span research:** Virtual = 10 min max before minds wander (in-person = 15-20 min)
- **Multitasking reality:** Remote audiences often have email, chat, phone open simultaneously
- **Your job:** Make it impossible to look away (vary stimuli, interact, energize)
- **Polls/quizzes:** Built into Zoom, Teams, Google Meet - easy to use
- **Chat monitoring:** If presenting solo, pause to check chat; if team, assign one person to monitor

**Examples/Stories:**
- Bad virtual presentation: Lecturer reads slides for 30 minutes straight (everyone zones out)
- Good virtual presentation: 8 minutes content → 2 minutes poll/discussion → 8 minutes content → 2 minutes Q&A (maintains attention)

**For Week 11:**
- Consider adding ONE interactive element to your group presentation
- Examples: Poll ("Which solution do you prefer?"), Chat question ("What challenges have you faced with this?")
- Even 30 seconds of interaction resets attention

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may be reluctant to unmute/chat in large groups
- Solution: Use polls/chat (lower barrier than speaking)
- If presenting to Vietnamese audience, explicitly invite participation ("Please share thoughts in chat")

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How often should you add interactive elements in virtual presentations?" (Every 7-10 minutes)
- "What's one strategy you'll use to engage your audience in Week 11?"

**Transition:**
- "We've covered a lot today. Let's synthesize the key takeaways..."

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Use this checklist as you prepare for Week 11"
- This isn't about perfection - it's about intentional improvement

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Before:** Preparation beats talent (practice with techniques, not just content)
- **During:** Stay present and use techniques we covered (vocal variety, body language)
- **Q&A:** Structure beats improvisation (PREP method)
- **Recording yourself:** Most effective way to improve (you'll see what audience sees)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Professional speakers use checklists (even after years of experience)
- Week 11 prep timeline:
  - This week: Record practice run, identify one vocal and one body language improvement
  - Next week: Practice 3+ times with full techniques, prepare Q&A answers

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which checklist item do you most need to focus on?"
- "When will you record your first practice run?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect this to your upcoming assessments..."

**SLIDE 21: Applying These Skills to Week 11**

TITLE: Applying These Skills to Week 11 Presentations

CONTENT:

**Your Week 11 Presentation Rubric Evaluates:**

**Group Presentation (30%):**
- **Delivery:** Confident, engaging, natural; applies course delivery techniques (eye contact, body language, vocal variety)
- **Time Management & Q&A:** Handles Q&A with confidence and knowledge

**Individual Presentation (15%):**
- **Personal Delivery:** Outstanding application of vocal variety and executive presence; highly engaging
- **Individual Preparation:** Thoroughly prepared, confident with material

**What This Means:**
- Content alone won't get you an A - delivery matters equally
- Practice these techniques NOW (Week 10), not the night before (Week 11)
- Record yourself, identify weaknesses, improve iteratively

**This Week's Deliverable:**
Presentation slides due Week 10 - finalize content so you can focus Week 11 on DELIVERY practice.

[LAYOUT: content-slide]
[PURPOSE: Persuade]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Everything we covered today is directly assessed in your Week 11 rubrics"
- This isn't theoretical - these techniques determine your grades

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Delivery criterion:** Specifically mentions "vocal variety," "eye contact," "body language" (course delivery techniques)
- **Q&A criterion:** "Handles Q&A with confidence" (PREP method, difficult questions strategies)
- **Personal delivery:** "Executive presence" appears in individual rubric
- **Timeline:** Slides due THIS week so you can spend Week 11 practicing DELIVERY, not making slides

**Examples/Stories:**
- Common mistake: Students finish slides the night before, never practice delivery
- Successful approach: Slides done Week 10, practice 3-5 times Week 11 focusing on vocal variety, body language, Q&A

**Grading Reality:**
- Two presentations with identical content can get different grades based on delivery
- Excellent content + poor delivery = B/C
- Good content + excellent delivery = A

**Check for Understanding:**
- "When are slides due?" (Week 10 - this week)
- "What should you focus on in Week 11?" (Delivery practice, not content creation)

**Transition:**
- "Before we wrap up, let's connect this to your other assessment this week..."

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Quiz 3 happens this week in tutorial - it covers Weeks 7-9, NOT today's content"
- Today (Week 10) is about presentation delivery for Week 11

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Quiz covers THREE weeks of content (Data Storytelling, Business Reports, Presentations Part I Design)
- Does NOT include today's delivery content
- Multiple choice format (same as Quiz 1 and Quiz 2)
- Review lecture slides, required readings, tutorial discussions from Weeks 7-9

**Study Strategy:**
- Review each week's slides focusing on frameworks and key principles
- Re-read HBR articles from those weeks
- Tutorial this week will include 15-20 min quiz prep for final review

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Quiz 3 includes Week 10 delivery content" → NO, only Weeks 7-9
- "I can cram the night before" → Three weeks of content is a lot; start reviewing now

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which weeks does Quiz 3 cover?" (7-9)
- "What topics from Week 7?" (Data storytelling and visualization)

**Transition:**
- "Let's wrap up with your key takeaways and next steps..."

- **Executive presence:** Learnable behaviors, not innate charisma
- **Q&A mastery:** PREP method gives you structure when you're improvising

**Examples/Stories:**
- Challenge: "Between now and Week 11, record yourself once, watch it, and improve ONE thing"
- That one improvement could boost your delivery score significantly

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the PREP method again?" (Point, Reason, Example, Point)
- "Name one executive presence signal?" (Open posture, eye contact, purposeful gestures, etc.)

**Transition:**
- "Here's what you need to do this week..."
