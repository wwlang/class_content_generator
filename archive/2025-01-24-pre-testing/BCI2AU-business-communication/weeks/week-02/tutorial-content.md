## MAIN ACTIVITY: Email Writing Practice (55 minutes)

### The Scenarios

You'll write professional emails for THREE different business situations, each requiring different tone and approach:

**Scenario 1: Formal Tone - Requesting Extension from Professor**
**Scenario 2: Professional Tone - Coordinating Team Project**
**Scenario 3: Empathetic Tone - Responding to Customer Complaint**

Each email should demonstrate BLUF technique, appropriate tone, and professional formatting.

---

### SCENARIO 1: Requesting Extension (Formal Tone)

**The Situation:**

You are enrolled in Professor Dr. Tran's Strategic Management course. The final business plan assignment is due this Friday, March 15. However, you've been dealing with a family emergency this week (your mother was hospitalized unexpectedly) and need additional time to complete the assignment to your usual standard.

**Your task:** Write a professional email to Dr. Tran requesting a 5-day extension (new deadline: Wednesday, March 20).

**Key considerations:**
- Formal tone appropriate for professor (authority figure)
- BLUF: State request clearly in opening
- Provide brief, professional explanation (not excessive personal detail)
- Suggest specific new deadline
- Show respect for professor's decision-making authority
- Demonstrate commitment to quality work

**Deliverable:** One professional email (200-250 words)

---

### SCENARIO 2: Team Coordination (Professional Tone)

**The Situation:**

You are team leader for a group presentation on "Digital Marketing Strategies" due in Week 11. Your team has four members: yourself, Linh, Duc, and Mai. The team met yesterday and decided:
- Presentation structure: Introduction (2 min) → Three main strategies (10 min) → Q&A preparation (3 min)
- Individual responsibilities assigned
- Next team meeting: This Friday, March 15 at 3pm in Library Study Room B

However, Mai was absent from yesterday's meeting and needs to be updated on decisions and her responsibilities.

**Your task:** Write an email to the full team (including Mai) summarizing meeting decisions, clarifying individual responsibilities, and confirming next meeting.

**Key considerations:**
- Professional but friendly tone (peers, but task-focused)
- BLUF: State purpose of email immediately
- Organize information clearly (bullet points for decisions)
- Specific action items for each team member
- Clear deadline and next steps
- Inclusive tone that brings Mai up to speed without making her feel excluded

**Deliverable:** One professional email (250-300 words)

---

### SCENARIO 3: Customer Service (Empathetic Tone)

**The Situation:**

You work as Customer Service Coordinator for VietShop, an online retailer. You received this email from customer Nguyen Thi Lan:

*"I ordered a laptop (Order #VN-2024-1847) on March 1 with promised delivery by March 10 for my daughter's university semester start. It is now March 13 and the laptop still hasn't arrived. I've tried tracking the shipment but the website shows no updates since March 5. This is completely unacceptable - my daughter needs this for her classes. I want immediate answers about where my order is and when it will actually arrive, or I want a full refund. This is terrible service."*

You checked the system and found:
- Order stuck in customs clearance (common delay for imported electronics)
- Expected release from customs: March 16
- Expected delivery: March 18
- Company policy: Can offer 15% refund for delay OR expedited shipping once released

**Your task:** Write a professional response that addresses Ms. Lan's concerns, explains the situation, provides specific timeline, and offers solution.

**Key considerations:**
- Empathetic tone acknowledging frustration (customer is legitimately upset)
- BLUF: Acknowledge problem and provide immediate information
- Balance transparency (explain delay) with accountability (take ownership)
- Specific timeline and action plan
- Offer concrete solution/compensation
- Rebuild trust while maintaining professionalism

**Deliverable:** One professional email (250-300 words)

---

### Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Choose TWO of the three scenarios to write.** (You must complete at least one, but two gives you better practice and feedback.)

**For each email you write:**

1. **Start with subject line** - Use keyword if appropriate (ACTION, REQUEST, INFO)
2. **Craft BLUF opening** - Answer who, what, when, where, why in first sentence/paragraph
3. **Provide necessary background** - Use bullets for multiple points
4. **Include clear call-to-action** - What do you want recipient to do?
5. **Choose appropriate greeting and closing** - Match tone level to scenario
6. **Proofread** - Check for grammar, spelling, tone

**Quality reminders:**
- **Active voice:** "I need an extension" not "An extension is needed"
- **Specific details:** Include dates, times, numbers (not "soon" or "later")
- **Professional tone:** Problem-solving approach, uses "I" and "you," courteous
- **Concision:** Every word serves a purpose, avoid redundancy

---

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**Exchange your emails with a partner.** If you wrote two emails, exchange both.

**Review your partner's email(s) using these criteria:**

**For each email, evaluate:**

☐ **Organization & Structure**
- Does email use BLUF (main point in first sentence/paragraph)?
- Is background information organized clearly (bullets if multiple points)?
- Is there a clear call-to-action stating what recipient should do?
- Does email fit on one screen without scrolling?

☐ **Clarity & Concision**
- Are sentences clear and easy to understand?
- Is language specific (includes dates, deadlines, concrete details)?
- Does email use active voice?
- Is it free of unnecessary words and redundancy?

☐ **Tone & Professionalism**
- Is tone appropriate for the scenario (formal/professional/empathetic)?
- Does email use "I" and "you" for human connection?
- Is email courteous and problem-solving focused (not blaming)?
- Are greeting and closing appropriate for audience?

☐ **Strategic Content**
- Is purpose of email immediately clear?
- Does opening answer "how does this affect me?" for recipient?
- Is necessary background information included?
- Does email make it easy for recipient to respond/take action?

---

**Provide feedback using these sentence starters:**

**One specific strength I notice:**
- "Your BLUF is excellent because..."
- "The tone is perfect for this scenario because..."
- "Your background section is clear because..."

**One area to strengthen:**
- "Consider making the BLUF more direct by..."
- "The tone could be adjusted by changing..."
- "To improve clarity, try..."

**Remember:** We're comparing different effective approaches, not finding errors. Multiple strategies can work - focus on how your partner's choices support their goal.

---

### Revision & Debrief (15 minutes)

**Revision Time (10 minutes)**

Based on peer feedback, revise ONE of your emails. Focus on:
- Strengthening your BLUF if it wasn't immediately clear
- Adjusting tone if reviewer suggested it didn't match scenario
- Adding specific details (dates, deadlines) if you were vague
- Simplifying language if you were too wordy

**Note:** You don't need to change your overall approach if your reasoning is sound - strengthen the execution of your strategy.

**Class Debrief (5 minutes)**

We'll discuss as a class:
- What was challenging about writing each scenario?
- How did tone change between formal, professional, and empathetic emails?
- What BLUF strategies worked well across different scenarios?
- How can you apply this to the Week 5 Email Series assignment?

## WRAP-UP: Self-Assessment & Next Steps (5 minutes)

### Self-Assessment Against Rubric

Think about the emails you wrote today:

**Rate yourself on each criterion (1-5 scale):**

1. **Organization & Structure** - Did you use BLUF effectively? Clear CTA?
2. **Clarity & Concision** - Active voice? Specific details? Concise?
3. **Tone & Professionalism** - Appropriate tone for scenario? Courteous?
4. **Strategic Content** - Clear purpose? Audience-centered?

**Identify:** Which criterion is your strongest? Which needs more practice?

---

### What to Revise Before Week 5 Submission

Based on today's practice and peer feedback:

**Strengthen before Email Series assignment:**
- If BLUF wasn't immediately clear → Practice stating main point in FIRST sentence
- If tone felt off → Review tone spectrum (formal/professional/casual) and examples
- If too wordy → Apply 8 S's: Simplicity and Specificity
- If unclear CTA → Always specify WHAT action and WHEN (deadline)

---

### Next Steps

**Before next week's lecture (Persuasive Communication):**
1. **Read required articles:**
   - Cialdini, R. B. (2001). Harnessing the science of persuasion. *HBR*.
   - Cialdini, R. B. (2013). The uses (and abuses) of influence. *HBR*.

2. **Think about:** A time someone successfully persuaded you to do something. What techniques did they use?

3. **Start drafting:** If you have ideas for your Email Series assignment, start drafting early - allows time for revision

**Preparation for Quiz 1 (Week 4):**
