## Quiz Solutions

### Question 1: BLUF Technique
**Correct: A**

**Why A is correct:**
BLUF stands for "Bottom Line Up Front" and was developed by the U.S. military to ensure critical information is communicated immediately. Sehgal's HBR article (2016) explains that military professionals lead emails with this technique to answer the five W's (who, what, where, when, why) in the opening, maximizing mission success through precise communication. The technique reduces follow-up questions by 30-40% according to military research and ensures key message is received even if email is only partially read.

**Why wrong:**
- B: Acronym is incorrect - BLUF is not about "Brief, Logical, Unified, Focused" sequencing
- C: Not "Business Language Usage Format" - this is fabricated terminology
- D: Not "Baseline Understanding For Letters" - misses the core concept of stating conclusion first

**Common confusion:** Students sometimes think BLUF is about making emails brief (it is, but that's not the definition). BLUF is specifically about PLACEMENT of main point (first, not buried).

**Teaching tip:** Use analogy of news article inverted pyramid - most important information first, supporting details after. Or compare to texting a friend "Can you pick me up at 5pm?" (BLUF) vs. long story ending with the request (buried).

### Question 2: Subject Line Keywords
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
According to Sehgal's military email framework, "DECISION" is the keyword used when the email requires recipient to make a judgment or choose between options. Other keywords include ACTION (requires response), INFO (FYI only), REQUEST (seeks approval), SIGN (needs signature), and COORD (coordination needed). These keywords force the sender to clarify their intent before writing.

**Why wrong:**
- A: ACTION is for emails requiring a response/action, but not specifically for decision-making between options
- B: REQUEST is for seeking approval or permission, which is different from asking recipient to decide between alternatives
- D: COORD is for coordination activities, not decision-making

**Common confusion:** Students blur REQUEST and DECISION - help clarify: REQUEST = "Please approve this" (one option), DECISION = "Should we go with Option A or B?" (choosing between alternatives).

**Teaching tip:** Show examples of each keyword in context. Have students categorize sample email purposes to practice distinguishing between keywords.

### Question 3: Active vs. Passive Voice
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
"The finance team submitted the budget proposal last Friday" uses active voice with clear subject (finance team) performing action (submitted). This structure is clearer, more direct, and 10% faster to read according to Birchard's neuroscience research. Active voice also creates accountability by identifying who did what.

**Why wrong:**
- A: "was submitted by" is passive voice construction - action before actor
- B: "It has been determined" is passive and vague - no agent identified
- D: "A decision was reached" is passive - doesn't identify who decided

**Common confusion:** Vietnamese students sometimes overuse passive voice because it's considered more formal/polite in Vietnamese academic writing. Clarify that in English business communication, active voice shows confidence and clarity, not rudeness.

**Teaching tip:** Quick test for passive voice - if you can add "by zombies" after the verb and sentence still works, it's passive. "The report was completed (by zombies)" = passive. "I completed the report (by zombies)" = nonsense, so it's active.

### Question 4: Processing Fluency
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Birchard's neuroscience research (2021) found that passive voice reduces comprehension accuracy by 10% and slows reading speed. This is because brain must work harder to identify the agent of action and reconstruct meaning. "Processing fluency" refers to how easily brain understands and remembers information - simpler structures create better fluency.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Opposite of research finding - passive reduces, not increases comprehension
- C: Research shows passive DOES significantly affect comprehension (10% reduction)
- D: Passive doesn't improve memory - active voice is better remembered

**Common confusion:** Students think formal = passive. Clarify that professional writing can be both simple AND formal - formality comes from word choice and courtesy, not sentence structure complexity.

**Teaching tip:** Have students read passive and active versions of same sentence out loud, timing themselves. They'll notice active version is faster and feels more natural.

### Question 5: Tone Adaptation
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Communication with a professor about missing office hours requires formal tone, especially if this is not an established relationship. "Dear Dr. Nguyen, I regret to inform you..." shows appropriate respect for authority figure, uses formal greeting (Dear + title + name), and formal language ("regret to inform"). This tone level matches high-stakes context and hierarchical relationship.

**Why wrong:**
- A: "Hey Prof!" is far too casual for professor communication - could damage professional relationship
- B: "Hi Dr. Nguyen, Unfortunately..." is professional but not formal enough for this context (missing scheduled appointment with authority figure)
- D: "What's up? Just FYI..." is completely inappropriate - would be seen as disrespectful

**Common confusion:** Some students think B is acceptable because "Hi" + title seems polite enough. Clarify that first communication about a problem/absence should err on more formal side - relationship can become more casual later if professor sets that tone.

**Teaching tip:** Draw tone spectrum on board (Formal → Professional → Casual) and have students place different scenarios along spectrum. Office hours miss = formal; asking classmate about homework = casual; emailing project partner = professional.

### Question 6: Specificity in Business Writing
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Birchard's neuroscience research found that concrete words like "pelican" activate more neurons in visual and motor brain regions than abstract words like "bird," causing "the brain to process meaning more robustly." When brain creates specific mental image (pelican = large water bird with pouch), it engages multiple neural pathways, leading to deeper processing and better memory retention. This is why specific details (dates, numbers, names) more memorable than vague language.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Length has nothing to do with why concrete words are effective - focus is neural activation
- C: Formality not the reason - concrete words work because of brain processing, not professional tone
- D: Research doesn't claim 25% length reduction - benefit is comprehension and memory

**Common confusion:** Students might think specificity just means "more detail" - it's actually about activating visual/sensory brain regions through concrete language.

**Teaching tip:** Demonstrate with example: "Eat fruit" (abstract, weak image) vs. "Eat a ripe mango" (concrete, strong sensory image - students can almost taste it). Then apply to business: "Update soon" vs. "Update by Friday, March 15 at 5pm."

### Question 7: Email Channel Selection
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Research on Vietnamese business culture (Vietnam.vn, 2024; Sourceofasia.com, 2024) shows that while Zalo dominates daily communication (85% of Vietnamese use it), email remains standard for formal contracts, communication with international partners, official documentation, and communication with superiors in organizational hierarchy. Email creates permanent record and signals professionalism in these contexts. Many Vietnamese SMEs use Zalo for quick decisions but switch to email for anything requiring documentation or formal approval.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Age is not the determining factor - context and purpose drive channel choice
- C: Zalo is widely used but not for ALL business communication - formal/legal matters require email
- D: File size is not the primary consideration for channel selection - formality and documentation needs matter more

**Common confusion:** Students who primarily use Zalo might think it's acceptable for all business contexts. Clarify that while Zalo works for team coordination and quick questions, international business and formal documentation require email proficiency.

**Teaching tip:** Share examples: Coordinating lunch with Vietnamese colleague = Zalo is fine. Sending signed contract to client = must use email with proper documentation. Students need to code-switch between channels based on context.

### Question 8: The Eight S's Framework
**Correct: D**

**Why D is correct:**
"Social content" is Birchard's 7th S, referring to human-centered writing that activates brain regions interpreting social signals. Research shows readers infer character traits within 650 milliseconds when reading human-centered language, and second-person pronouns ("you") significantly improve learning retention compared to third-person text. Using "you" and "I" makes email feel like social interaction, not just information transfer.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Simplicity is about short sentences and familiar vocabulary, not social pronouns
- B: Specificity is about concrete vs. abstract language (pelican vs. bird), not pronouns
- C: Stirring language is about emotional words that bypass cognitive processing

**Common confusion:** Students might associate "Social" with social media rather than social cognition. Clarify that "social content" means writing that activates brain's people-processing systems.

**Teaching tip:** Compare two versions: "The report should be submitted" (no social content) vs. "Could you please submit the report?" (social - activates relationship processing). Students can feel the difference in tone.

### Question 9: Vietnamese Email Culture
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Research on Vietnamese business culture shows that emailing and working after work hours or on holidays is regarded as an infringement on personal time, unlike Western "always-on" work culture. Vietnamese employees are concerned with quality of life, meaning calling or sending emails after work hours is considered a violation of their personal time (JDI Group, 2024; Vietnam Briefing, 2024). This reflects Vietnamese emphasis on work-life balance and respect for personal boundaries.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Opposite of Vietnamese cultural values - after-hours work seen as boundary violation, not dedication
- C: Timing does matter in Vietnamese culture - respect for personal time is significant cultural value
- D: Channel (Zalo vs. email) doesn't change the principle - after-hours communication generally discouraged

**Common confusion:** Students influenced by Western "hustle culture" media might think late-night emails show commitment. Clarify that in Vietnamese professional context, respecting boundaries shows professionalism.

**Teaching tip:** Discuss scheduling send feature in email clients - write email when you think of it, but schedule delivery for next business day morning. This balances productivity with cultural respect.

### Question 10: Call-to-Action
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
An effective CTA specifies WHAT action you need and WHEN (deadline) to make it easy for recipient to respond and create accountability. Vague CTAs like "let me know" or "when you have time" reduce response rates because recipient must figure out what to do and when. Specific CTAs ("Please send completed spreadsheet by Friday, March 15 at 5pm") increase response rates by 20-30% according to email effectiveness research.

**Why wrong:**
- A: No deadline reduces urgency and accountability - request likely to be forgotten or deprioritized
- B: Multiple options create decision paralysis - make it easy by recommending specific action
- D: "Let me know if you have questions" is passive, not actionable - doesn't tell recipient what to DO

**Common confusion:** Vietnamese students sometimes taught that being specific about deadlines sounds demanding. Clarify that specificity shows respect for both your time and recipient's time - helps them prioritize appropriately.

**Teaching tip:** Show research that emails with specific deadlines get 30% faster response than those without. It's not demanding - it's helping recipient manage their workload.

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

This activity is deliberately open-ended with three realistic scenarios requiring different tone levels (formal, professional, empathetic). Students choose TWO of three scenarios to write, allowing them to focus on contexts most relevant to their needs while still comparing approaches during peer review. The activity mirrors the Email Series assignment structure (writing multiple emails for different audiences), giving students direct practice with skills they'll be graded on in Week 5. Vietnamese students often struggle with directness required in English business communication, so this safe practice environment with peer feedback is crucial for building confidence before high-stakes assessment.

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- BLUF clearly states main point in first sentence (e.g., "I am requesting a 5-day extension..." not burying request in paragraph 3)
- Tone matches scenario context (formal for professor, professional for team, empathetic for customer complaint)
- Specific details included (dates, order numbers, meeting times - not vague "soon" or "later")
- Active voice used consistently ("I need..." not "It has been determined...")
- Call-to-action explicit and includes deadline where appropriate ("Please respond by..." not "Let me know when you can")
- Professional formatting (appropriate greeting, organized background bullets, courteous closing)
- Concise - no unnecessary words, every sentence serves the purpose
- Human-centered language using "I" and "you" to create connection

**Critical Moments:**

**During Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes):**

Around the 5-minute mark, circulate to check that students are starting with BLUF and not writing lengthy background first. Some students will instinctively start emails with extensive context or pleasantries ("I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding...") - gently redirect: "What's your main point? Start with that sentence, THEN add background." Vietnamese students particularly may need this guidance, as Vietnamese communication culture values relationship-building openings; reassure them that BLUF doesn't eliminate courtesy, just reorders for clarity.

Around the 15-minute mark, check tone adaptation. Listen for students reading drafts aloud to themselves or partners - this is good practice for hearing tone. If you notice students using identical tone for all scenarios (e.g., overly formal for team email or too casual for professor), ask: "Who is your audience for this email? What relationship do you have with them? How should that affect your word choice?" For Scenario 3 (customer complaint), students might initially respond defensively - remind them that empathy comes first ("I understand your frustration" or "I apologize for the inconvenience") before explaining what went wrong.

**During Peer Review (15 minutes):**

This is where students learn most. Monitor for constructive vs. critical feedback. Vietnamese culture emphasizes harmony and avoiding direct criticism, so students may give only positive feedback ("Everything is good!") without identifying areas to strengthen. If you hear this, prompt with: "What's ONE thing your partner could adjust to make the BLUF even clearer?" or "How could they make the deadline more specific?" Frame it as comparing approaches, not finding errors: "You both chose different strategies - discuss why each could work and what the trade-offs are."

Watch for students who focus on grammar corrections rather than strategic content. Redirect: "Grammar matters, but focus first on the four rubric criteria: Does the email use BLUF? Is tone appropriate? Is the CTA clear?" Some pairs will finish peer review in 8-10 minutes - that's fine; they can start revision early or compare their emails to identify patterns.

**During Revision & Debrief (15 minutes):**

Most students will revise for the first 8-10 minutes, then be ready for class discussion. Use the final 5 minutes to draw out key insights. Ask: "What was hardest about Scenario 1 (formal tone)?" Likely answer: balancing politeness with directness. Ask: "How did you handle it?" Multiple students share approaches - this normalizes that there are many ways to execute BLUF and formal tone successfully. Ask about Scenario 3: "How did you start the customer complaint response?" Some will have led with apology, others with solution, others with explanation - discuss why all can work depending on severity and customer relationship. Key point: BLUF applies to all, but specific opening varies based on context.

**Timing Flexibility:**

If main activity runs long (students engaged in writing and revision), you can assign quiz practice as homework to complete before next tutorial. The quiz questions are low-stakes practice (not graded), so out-of-class completion is acceptable if it means students get more hands-on writing practice during tutorial time. Prioritize the email writing and peer review - these are the skills that transfer directly to the Week 5 assessment. If you have time for quiz review in class, great, but writing practice is the core value-add of this tutorial.

Conversely, if students finish email writing quickly (some may complete two emails in 20 minutes), extend peer review time - have them swap with a second partner to get additional perspective, or do small group review (3-4 students comparing how they approached same scenario). Multiple perspectives on tone and BLUF execution help students see that professional writing has flexibility within structure.
