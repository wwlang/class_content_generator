**Duration:** 90 minutes

---

## Opening (10 minutes)

### Quick Concept Review

Welcome to Week 6 tutorial! Today we'll apply the crisis communication frameworks from lecture to real business scenarios.

**Three Key Concepts from Lecture:**

1. **The Three Pillars:** Speed + Accuracy + Empathy are ALL required for effective crisis response
   - 74% of people expect response within one hour
   - Share only verified information, update as you learn more
   - Show genuine care for those affected

2. **Employees First, Then External**
   - Internal communication must precede external announcements (Argenti, 2002)
   - Employees become your ambassadors or critics based on how you treat them

3. **Tiered Response Solves Speed vs. Accuracy**
   - Immediate (5-15 min): Holding statement
   - Short-term (1-3 hours): Initial findings
   - Medium-term (24-48 hours): Detailed response
   - Long-term (1-2 weeks): Post-crisis analysis

## MAIN ACTIVITY: Crisis Response Analysis & Design (55-60 minutes)

### The Scenario

**VietTech Solutions** is a Vietnamese software development company with 200 employees providing e-commerce platform solutions for small-to-medium businesses across ASEAN. On Tuesday morning at 9:47 AM, a critical security vulnerability in their platform was discovered by a security researcher who posted about it on Twitter and LinkedIn.

**The Crisis Details:**
- The vulnerability could potentially expose customer payment data
- 850 client businesses use the platform, serving millions of end customers
- No confirmed data breach has occurred, but the risk exists
- Security team estimates 8-12 hours to patch the vulnerability
- Media outlets have picked up the story and are requesting comment
- Employees are seeing the news on social media and messaging each other in confusion
- Some clients are calling the support line demanding answers

**Your Role:** You are part of VietTech's crisis communication team.

**Your Task:** Design crisis communication responses for different stakeholder groups using today's frameworks.

### The Data / Materials

**Stakeholder Groups:**
1. **Employees** (200 internal staff - developers, support, sales, management)
2. **Clients** (850 businesses using your platform)
3. **End Customers** (millions of shoppers using client websites)
4. **Media** (Tech journalists covering the story)
5. **Social Media / Public** (General public and tech community)

**Time Constraints:**
- **Now:** 9:47 AM Tuesday - vulnerability just discovered
- **15 minutes from now:** 10:02 AM - holding statement deadline
- **3 hours from now:** 12:47 PM - initial update deadline
- **24 hours from now:** Wednesday 9:47 AM - detailed response deadline

**Available Channels:**
- Email (internal and client communication)
- Company website / blog
- Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter
- Direct phone calls
- Press release

**Framework Checklist (From Lecture):**
- Argenti's Five Principles (visibility, channels, employees first, planning, values)
- Three Pillars (Speed + Accuracy + Empathy)
- Tiered Response (Immediate → Short-term → Medium-term → Long-term)

---

### Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:** Design a crisis communication plan that includes:

1. **Immediate Response (5-15 min):** Holding statement for at least TWO stakeholder groups
2. **Short-Term Response (1-3 hours):** Initial findings update for ONE stakeholder group
3. **Channel Strategy:** Which channels for which stakeholders and why
4. **Stakeholder Priority:** Order of communication and rationale

**Considerations:**
- Apply Argenti's principle: Employees first, then external
- Use tiered response to balance speed vs. accuracy
- Adapt tone and content for each stakeholder group (employees need different info than media)
- Include all Three Pillars: Speed (respond fast), Accuracy (verify before sharing), Empathy (show care)
- Consider Vietnamese business context (social media dominance, government/regulatory stakeholders)

**Format:** Write 2-3 actual message drafts (50-100 words each) plus brief channel strategy explanation.
