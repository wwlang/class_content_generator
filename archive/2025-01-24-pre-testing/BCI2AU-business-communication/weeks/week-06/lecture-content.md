## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome students to Week 6 on crisis communication

**Key Teaching Points:**
- This is one of the most practical and critical topics in business communication
- In the digital age, crises can emerge and escalate within minutes
- The skills learned today apply to organizations of all sizes, from startups to multinational corporations
- Every professional should understand crisis communication principles

**Transition:**

**SLIDE 2: Opening Question**

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

"What happens when a company stays silent for 48 hours after a crisis breaks?"

— Your reputation is being written by others

[PURPOSE: Engage with provocative question]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Pause after reading the question - let it sink in for 5-10 seconds
- Ask: "Show of hands - how many of you have seen a company crisis unfold on social media?"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- In Vietnam's fast-growing digital economy, 77% of the population uses social media (2024)
- When companies don't communicate, customers, media, and competitors fill the void
- Vietnamese consumers expect real-time responses on social platforms
- Silence is interpreted as guilt, incompetence, or indifference

**Examples/Stories:**
- Reference the café franchise disability discrimination incident mentioned in Vietnamese crisis communication research
- The victim's personal Facebook update had more impact than any official statement
- Vietnamese organizations often hope crises will "fade away" - but social media prevents this

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why do you think silence is so damaging in a crisis?" [Take 1-2 responses]
- Expected: loss of trust, rumors spread, competitors attack, customers leave

**Transition:**
- "Today we'll learn the frameworks and principles that help organizations respond effectively when crises strike..."

[PURPOSE: Prime vocabulary for Vietnamese ESL students]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's review the key terms you'll hear throughout today's lecture"
- Pronunciation practice: Have students repeat "accountability" and "transparency"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Distinguish between "crisis" (major threat) and "incident" (unexpected event)
- In Vietnamese business culture, "minh bạch" (transparency) is increasingly valued by younger consumers
- "Bên liên quan" includes multiple groups: customers, employees, investors, government, media
- Holding statements are Vietnam's equivalent of "first response" - acknowledging the situation quickly

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnamese tech companies now issue holding statements on social media within 15-30 minutes
- Traditional Vietnamese companies often waited days - this approach no longer works
- ASEAN companies leading in crisis response: Grab, Shopee (respond within the hour)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between a crisis and an incident?" [Quick check]

**Transition:**
- "Now that we have our vocabulary, let's define what we mean by crisis communication..."

SUBTITLE: Understanding What We're Up Against

[PURPOSE: Signal major section transition]
[TIMING: 1 minute]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "We'll start by understanding what makes a crisis different from everyday business problems"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- This section covers definitions, types of crises, and foundational frameworks
- Approximately 20 minutes of content

**SLIDE 7: What Defines a Crisis?**

TITLE: What Defines a Business Crisis?

CONTENT:

**Three Essential Characteristics:**

**1. Threat to Organization**
- Significant potential for negative consequences
- Can damage reputation, operations, or financial performance
- Requires immediate attention from leadership

**2. Surprise Element**
- Often unexpected or unforeseen
- Limited time for decision-making
- Normal communication channels may be insufficient

**3. Short Decision Time**
- Requires rapid response (hours, not days)
- "Golden hour" concept: First 60 minutes are critical
- Social media has compressed timelines even further

*Institute for Public Relations. (2024). Crisis management and communications. https://instituteforpr.org/crisis-management-and-communications/*

[PURPOSE: Define crisis characteristics]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Not every problem is a crisis - let's understand the distinction"
- Write on board: "Crisis = Threat + Surprise + Short Time"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Threat: Must have potential for serious harm (not just minor inconvenience)
- Surprise: Even if you have crisis plans, the specific situation is often unexpected
- Short time: The "golden hour" used to be 60 minutes; now it's often 15 minutes or less
- Social media compressed timelines: 70% of customers expect real-time response (research finding)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: A food safety incident at a restaurant chain spreads on Facebook within 30 minutes
- Traditional response (2 days) vs. modern expectation (2 hours)
- Technology incident: Server outage during peak shopping (e.g., Lazada during sale events)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- Students think all bad news is a crisis → Clarify: only if it meets all three criteria
- Minor complaints are problems, not crises (unless they go viral)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Is a single customer complaint on Facebook a crisis?" [No - unless it goes viral and meets the three criteria]
- "What about a data breach affecting 10,000 customers?" [Yes - meets all three]

**Transition:**
- "Now that we know what a crisis is, let's look at the different types..."

---

**SLIDE 8: Types of Business Crises**

TITLE: Common Types of Business Crises

CONTENT:

**Six Major Crisis Categories:**

1. **Technological Crises**
   - IT system failures, data breaches, cybersecurity incidents
   - Example: E-commerce platform crash during major sale

2. **Human Resource Crises**
   - Workplace accidents, labor disputes, harassment allegations
   - Example: Employee safety incident in manufacturing

3. **Product/Service Failures**
   - Recalls, quality issues, safety concerns
   - Example: Food contamination at restaurant chain

4. **Financial Crises**
   - Bankruptcy threats, fraud, major losses
   - Example: Sudden liquidity crisis

5. **Reputational Crises**
   - Social media backlash, boycott campaigns
   - Example: Discrimination allegations

6. **Natural Disasters**
   - Floods, storms, pandemics affecting operations
   - Example: COVID-19 lockdowns, Vietnam flooding

[PURPOSE: Categorize crisis types]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Crises come in many forms - let's categorize them"
- "Understanding the type helps you know which stakeholders to prioritize"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Technological: Increasingly common as businesses digitalize
- HR: Often sensitive due to human impact and legal implications
- Product: Requires speed + technical accuracy balance
- Financial: Involves investors and regulators as key stakeholders
- Reputational: Can emerge from any of the above, spread fastest on social media
- Natural: External factors, focuses on business continuity

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam technological crisis: VNG Corporation facing server issues during major game launch
- Reputational: The café disability discrimination incident (social media firestorm)
- Natural disaster: Vietnam flooding disrupting supply chains (requires stakeholder updates)
- ASEAN example: Grab's response to driver-passenger safety incidents

**Common Misconceptions:**
- One crisis type = one response → Actually, many crises span multiple categories
- Example: Data breach (technological) quickly becomes reputational crisis

**Check for Understanding:**
- "A restaurant discovers food contamination and posts about it on social media - what type(s) of crisis?" [Product + Reputational if handled poorly]

**Transition:**
- "Different crisis types require different responses. Let's look at Argenti's framework for crisis communication..."

---

**SLIDE 9: Argenti's Crisis Communication Framework**

TITLE: Framework: Argenti's Crisis Communication Principles

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

CONTENT:

**Five Core Principles for Crisis Response:**

**Principle 1: Get on the Scene**
Leaders must be visibly present and accessible during crises. Employees and stakeholders need tangible proof that management prioritizes their concerns (Argenti, 2002).

**Principle 2: Choose Channels Carefully**
Leverage multiple communication channels: voice mail, websites, social media, toll-free hotlines, media outlets. Channel redundancy ensures message saturation (Argenti, 2002).

**Principle 3: Communicate with Employees First**
Internal communication must precede external statements. Organizations face "a human crisis" requiring focus on people before customers or investors (Argenti, 2002).

**Principle 4: Have a Plan in Place**
Establish contingency work sites, backup communication infrastructure, and designated crisis communicators. Centralize decision-making while decentralizing operations (Argenti, 2002).

**Principle 5: Improvise from Strong Foundations**
Employees execute improvised responses effectively when company values are pre-established. Culture guides decisions when scripts fail (Argenti, 2002).

*Argenti, P. A. (2002, December). Crisis communication: Lessons from 9/11. Harvard Business Review, 80(12), 103–109. https://hbr.org/2002/12/crisis-communication-lessons-from-911*

[PURPOSE: Present research-backed framework]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This framework comes from Harvard Business Review's analysis of 9/11 crisis responses"
- "These principles apply to any crisis, from tech incidents to natural disasters"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Principle 1 (Visibility): Vietnamese business culture values face-to-face leadership, even more important in crises
- Principle 2 (Channels): Don't rely on one channel; what if your website crashes?
- Principle 3 (Employees First): Internal stakeholders become your ambassadors or your critics
- Principle 4 (Planning): The time to prepare is before the crisis, not during
- Principle 5 (Values): If your company values are just words on a wall, they won't help in crisis

**Examples/Stories:**
- Get on the Scene: Morgan Stanley's leaders on-site after 9/11
- Vietnam context: CEO of Vietnamese tech company personally addressing server outage on livestream
- Employees First: Starbucks managers near Ground Zero opened stores for first responders - values-driven
- ASEAN example: Grab CEO addressing driver safety concerns via company-wide town hall

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Improvise" doesn't mean "make it up" → It means adapt your values to unexpected situations
- Planning doesn't prevent improvisation; it enables effective improvisation

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why should employees hear from you BEFORE customers?" [Employees are your front line, they'll be asked questions, they need to be informed to represent you well]
- "Can you have too many communication channels in a crisis?" [No - redundancy is good]

**Transition:**
- "Argenti's framework gives us the structure. Now let's tackle the hardest question in crisis communication..."

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is the toughest decision you'll face in a crisis: How fast should you respond?"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- This section explores research on response timing expectations
- We'll look at what stakeholders expect vs. what organizations can deliver
- Approximately 15 minutes of content

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with what the research tells us about timing..."

**SLIDE 11: The Collapse of the Golden Hour**

TITLE: The "Golden Hour" Is Now 15 Minutes

<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

CONTENT:

**74%**

of people expect organizations to respond within ONE HOUR on social media during a crisis

*American Red Cross. (2012). Social media in disasters and emergencies. https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/Preparedness___Disaster_Recovery/Social_Media/SocialMediaSlideDeck.pdf*

[PURPOSE: Emphasize urgency with dramatic statistic]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let that number sink in: 74% expect a response in one hour or less"
- "The 'golden hour' concept in crisis communication has collapsed"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Traditional crisis communication referenced "golden hour" - time to establish facts and response
- Social media compressed this to minutes, not hours
- In Vietnam's digital landscape (77% social media penetration), expectations are even higher
- 70% of customers expect real-time communication during crisis situations (research)
- Detecting a brewing crisis 30 minutes faster can stop a rumor before it goes viral

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Lazada or Shopee experiencing checkout failures during 11.11 sale
- Customers expect updates every 15-30 minutes on social media
- Traditional companies waiting 2-3 hours face massive social media backlash
- ASEAN leader: Grab responds to service incidents within 20-30 minutes on Twitter/Facebook

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "We should wait until we have ALL the facts" → No, issue holding statement immediately
- "One hour is plenty of time" → Not in Vietnamese social media environment

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What happens if you wait 3 hours to acknowledge a crisis?" [Rumors fill the void, competitors attack, customers defect]
- "Can you ever respond TOO fast?" [Yes - if you share inaccurate information that you later retract]

**Transition:**
- "So speed matters. But what about accuracy? Can you have both?"

---

**SLIDE 12: The Speed vs. Accuracy Balance**

TITLE: Balancing Speed and Accuracy

<!-- LAYOUT: comparison-table -->

CONTENT:

| Respond Too Slowly | Respond Too Quickly (Without Facts) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Customers assume the worst | You may share inaccurate information |
| Competitors fill the information void | Retractions damage credibility further |
| Rumors spread unchecked on social media | Legal and compliance risks increase |
| "They don't care" perception grows | Stakeholders lose trust in your competence |
| Crisis escalates unnecessarily | You create secondary crises |

**The Solution: Tiered Response**
1. **Immediate (5-15 min):** Holding statement - "We're aware and investigating"
2. **Short-term (1-3 hours):** Initial findings and next steps
3. **Medium-term (24-48 hours):** Detailed response with actions
4. **Long-term (1-2 weeks):** Post-crisis analysis and prevention

[PURPOSE: Show the two-sided risk and solution]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is the central tension in crisis communication: speed vs. accuracy"
- "Get it wrong on either side and you're in trouble"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Too slow: Creates information vacuum that gets filled with speculation
- Too fast without facts: You become the source of misinformation
- Research shows: "Speed should never compromise accuracy or empathy" (crisis communication research)
- The tiered response solves this: acknowledge fast, then provide details as you learn them

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Vietnamese café chain facing food safety concern
  - BAD: Wait 2 days for lab results before saying anything → Customers assume guilt
  - GOOD: Immediate holding statement (30 min) + update when results available (48 hours)
- Technology incident: E-commerce site crash
  - Immediate: "We're experiencing technical issues, our team is working on it"
  - 1 hour: "Issue identified, estimated resolution in 2 hours"
  - 3 hours: "Resolved, here's what happened and how we'll prevent it"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Holding statement admits guilt" → No, it shows you're aware and taking action
- "I need complete information before speaking" → No, acknowledge and update as you learn

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What should a holding statement include?" [Acknowledgment, empathy, commitment to investigate, timeline for update]
- "When should you issue it?" [Within 15-30 minutes of becoming aware]

**Transition:**
- "Speed and accuracy matter, but there's a third element that's equally critical..."

---

**SLIDE 13: The Three Pillars of Crisis Response**

TITLE: Three Pillars of Effective Crisis Response

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

CONTENT:

**Speed:** Respond within 15-30 minutes with holding statement. 74% of people expect response within one hour (American Red Cross, 2012).

**Accuracy:** Share only verified information. Update as facts emerge. Speed should never compromise accuracy (crisis communication research).

**Empathy:** Show you care about those affected. Research shows empathy is as critical as speed in crisis response (Prevency, 2024).

**Formula for Success:**
Fast acknowledgment + Honest communication + Genuine concern = Trust preservation

[PURPOSE: Integrate speed, accuracy, and empathy]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Speed and accuracy are necessary but not sufficient"
- "The third pillar - empathy - is what preserves trust"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Speed: Sets expectations, shows responsiveness
- Accuracy: Builds credibility, prevents secondary crises
- Empathy: Demonstrates care, preserves relationships
- Research shows: "What matters in a social media crisis? Speed and Empathy" (Prevency)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Restaurant food safety incident
  - Without empathy: "We're investigating the situation" → Feels cold, corporate
  - With empathy: "We're deeply sorry for anyone affected. Your health and safety are our top priority. We're investigating immediately and will share findings within 24 hours" → Shows care
- Contrast: Company focusing only on legal protection vs. company showing genuine concern
- ASEAN example: Airlines during flight delays - compare cold operational updates vs. empathetic communication

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Empathy admits liability" → No, you can show care without admitting fault
- "Empathy is soft/weak" → Actually, it's strategic - preserves trust and relationships

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you show empathy without admitting you caused the problem?" [Yes - "We're sorry this happened to you" vs. "We're sorry we caused this"]

**Transition:**
- "We've covered when and how to respond. Now let's talk about WHO you're responding to..."

**SLIDE 14: Part 3: Stakeholder Communication**

<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

TITLE: Part 3: Stakeholder Communication

SUBTITLE: Different Audiences, Different Messages

[PURPOSE: Signal major section transition]
[TIMING: 1 minute]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Not everyone needs the same message in a crisis"
- "Smart crisis communicators adapt their messages to specific stakeholder groups"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- This section covers internal vs. external stakeholders
- We'll learn how to prioritize and adapt messages
- Approximately 20 minutes of content

**Transition:**
- "First, let's identify who your stakeholders are in a crisis..."

---

**SLIDE 15: Mapping Your Crisis Stakeholders**

TITLE: Identifying Crisis Stakeholders

CONTENT:

**Internal Stakeholders:**
- **Employees** (all levels - they're your frontline ambassadors)
- **Management/Leadership** (decision-makers and visible representatives)
- **Board of Directors** (governance and oversight responsibilities)

**External Stakeholders:**
- **Customers** (current and potential - your revenue source)
- **Media** (traditional press, bloggers, influencers - shape public narrative)
- **Investors/Shareholders** (financial stakeholders concerned about impact)
- **Government/Regulators** (compliance and legal obligations)
- **Community/Public** (broader society, activist groups)
- **Partners/Suppliers** (business continuity implications)

**Priority Rule:** Communicate with internal stakeholders FIRST, before external announcements (Argenti, 2002).

[PURPOSE: Identify all stakeholder groups]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's map out who needs to hear from you during a crisis"
- Draw two columns on board: "Internal" and "External"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Internal first: Argenti's research shows employees must hear from leadership before media does
- Employees become brand ambassadors or critics based on how you treat them
- Different stakeholders care about different aspects of the crisis
- Vietnamese context: Government/regulators often play larger role than in Western markets
- ASEAN context: Community and social media influencers have significant power

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Tech company data breach
  - Employees learn from media instead of leadership → They feel disrespected, share frustrations on social media
  - Employees briefed first → They become informed defenders: "My company told us immediately and here's what they're doing"
- Crisis prioritization: Employee accident in factory
  - Priority 1: Affected family and employees (internal)
  - Priority 2: Government/labor authorities (regulatory)
  - Priority 3: Media and public (external)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I should tell everyone at the same time" → No, strategic sequencing matters
- "Customers are always first priority" → No, employees are - they serve customers

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why must employees hear first?" [They're your frontline, they'll be asked questions, they need to represent you accurately]
- "Who might you forget in a crisis?" [Partners/suppliers who depend on you for business continuity]

**Transition:**
- "Now that we know WHO to communicate with, let's talk about WHAT each group needs to hear..."

---

**SLIDE 16: What Employees Need to Hear**

TITLE: Internal Crisis Communication: What Employees Need

CONTENT:

**Four Essential Messages for Employees:**

**1. Current State of Business**
- Candid, frequent updates (at least daily) about business status
- Employees need to know the company's actual condition as soon as reasonably possible
- If you don't provide updates, they'll fill the information vacuum with assumptions (Leschke-Kahle, 2020)

**2. Personal Impact**
- How this crisis affects their job, their team, their safety
- What's expected of them during the crisis response
- What support is available to them

**3. Leadership Visibility**
- Hear from both top organizational leaders AND direct team leaders
- Authentic voice matters more than polished messages (Leschke-Kahle, 2020)
- Seeing you care matters more than perfect communication

**4. Meaningful Work**
- How they can contribute to the response
- Purpose-driven tasks restore routine and reinforce company pride (Argenti, 2002)

*Leschke-Kahle, A. (2020, April 9). What employees need to hear from leaders in times of crisis. MIT Sloan Management Review. https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-employees-need-to-hear-from-leaders-in-times-of-crisis/*

[PURPOSE: Specify internal stakeholder needs]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Employees aren't just workers - they're your most important stakeholders in a crisis"
- "Research from MIT Sloan Management Review identifies exactly what they need to hear"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Current state: Don't sugarcoat, don't hide - employees can handle truth better than uncertainty
- Personal impact: The first question every employee asks is "How does this affect ME?"
- Leadership visibility: Vietnamese culture particularly values face-to-face leadership
- Meaningful work: People want to help, not just wait - give them purpose

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Tech company facing server issues
  - BAD: Leadership sends one email and disappears for 3 days
  - GOOD: CEO sends daily video updates, team leaders hold brief check-ins, employees assigned specific response tasks
- Dell example from Argenti research: Internal website received 54,947 hits with 90% positive feedback because employees felt connected to response
- ASEAN example: Grab during pandemic - frequent CEO updates, clear guidance on driver safety

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I'll worry employees with too much information" → No, lack of information creates MORE worry
- "I need perfect communication" → No, authentic is better than polished (MIT Sloan research)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What happens if you only send one update per week during a crisis?" [Employees assume the worst, create their own narratives]
- "Who should communicate with employees - CEO or direct managers?" [BOTH - they need to hear from multiple levels]

**Transition:**
- "Employees need internal updates. But what about external stakeholders - customers and the public?"

---

**SLIDE 17: What External Stakeholders Need**

TITLE: External Crisis Communication: Customers, Media, Public

CONTENT:

**Five Essential Elements:**

**1. Acknowledgment**
- Immediate recognition that the situation exists
- Don't wait for complete information to acknowledge

**2. Empathy**
- Express genuine concern for those affected
- "We understand the impact this has on you..."

**3. Action**
- What you're doing RIGHT NOW to address the situation
- Concrete, specific steps (not vague promises)

**4. Accountability**
- Who is responsible for fixing this
- Transparency about what went wrong (when appropriate)

**5. Timeline**
- When they can expect updates and resolution
- Commit to specific timeframes and honor them

**Channel Selection:** Use platforms where your stakeholders are most active - social media for customers, press releases for media, investor calls for shareholders.

[PURPOSE: Specify external communication needs]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "External stakeholders need different information than employees"
- "They care less about internal processes, more about impact on THEM"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Acknowledgment: Shows you're aware and engaged (not ignoring)
- Empathy: Humanizes your organization, preserves relationships
- Action: Demonstrates competence and commitment
- Accountability: Builds trust through transparency
- Timeline: Sets expectations, gives people something to hold onto

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: E-commerce platform crash during sale
  - Social media post (5 minutes): "We're aware checkout is down. Our team is working to fix this. We'll update you in 30 minutes."
  - Update 1 (30 minutes): "Issue identified in payment gateway. Estimated resolution: 2 hours. All orders will be honored at sale prices."
  - Update 2 (2 hours): "System restored. Here's what happened and how we're preventing it..."
- Compare: Company that tweets once vs. company with regular updates
- Vietnamese consumer expectation: Real-time updates on Zalo, Facebook, or company app

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Accountability means admitting we're at fault" → No, it means taking responsibility for response (different from blame)
- "Timeline commitments lock us in" → Yes, that's the point - accountability builds trust

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between acknowledgment and accountability?" [Acknowledgment = we know it happened; Accountability = we're taking responsibility for fixing it]

**Transition:**
- "We've covered what to say to different stakeholders. Now let's talk about social media specifically..."

---

**SLIDE 18: Social Media Crisis Management**

TITLE: Managing Crises on Social Media

CONTENT:

**Social Media Realities:**

**Speed Expectation:** 69% think agencies should monitor social media to offer quick help; 74% expect response within one hour (American Red Cross, 2012)

**Detection Advantage:** Detecting a brewing crisis 30 minutes faster can stop a rumor before it goes viral

**Channel Characteristics:**
- **Facebook/Zalo:** Most-used platforms in Vietnam - priority for consumer crises
- **LinkedIn:** Professional stakeholders - B2B or employment-related crises
- **Twitter:** Real-time updates, media monitoring (limited Vietnam reach)
- **Company Website:** Authoritative source for detailed information

**Best Practices:**
1. Monitor social media 24/7 during crisis
2. Respond publicly AND privately (DMs for individual concerns)
3. Don't delete negative comments (shows you're hiding)
4. Use consistent messaging across all platforms
5. Provide social media team clear talking points

*Research: Vietnamese organizations often post on official websites but forget social media channels, making messages less relatable to stakeholders (EloQ, 2021).*

[PURPOSE: Address social media specific strategies]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "In Vietnam's digital economy, social media IS your crisis battleground"
- "77% of Vietnam's population uses social media - you can't ignore this channel"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Speed: Vietnamese consumers expect faster response than global average
- Platform selection: Facebook and Zalo dominate in Vietnam (not Twitter)
- Monitoring: Crises often emerge on social media before traditional channels
- Vietnamese organizational tendency: Focus on press releases, neglect social media (this is a mistake)
- EloQ research: Vietnamese companies post on websites, forget social media is where their audience is

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Café disability discrimination incident
  - Crisis started on Facebook, victim's Facebook update resolved it
  - Official press releases were too slow and wrong channel
- Positive example: VNG Corporation using Facebook for real-time game server status
- Bad example: Company deleting negative comments → Screenshot evidence goes viral: "They're hiding!"
- ASEAN example: Shopee responding to delivery complaints via Facebook Messenger + public page

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "We can control the narrative by deleting comments" → No, screenshots exist, deletion proves guilt
- "One person can handle social media in crisis" → No, you need team with clear shifts and talking points

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Should you respond to every negative comment?" [Respond to legitimate concerns publicly, move specific cases to DM, ignore trolls]
- "What platform should a Vietnamese restaurant use for food safety crisis?" [Facebook - where customers are]

**Transition:**
- "Social media is immediate and public. But there's one more stakeholder group with special needs..."

**SLIDE 19: Vietnamese Context - Cultural Considerations**

TITLE: Vietnamese Context: Crisis Communication Culture

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

CONTENT:

**Cultural Factors in Vietnamese Crisis Response:**

**1. Apology Avoidance**
Research shows apology is the least-used strategy among Vietnamese organizations. Companies tend to ignore crises hoping they will fade away, but social media prevents this approach from working (EloQ, 2021).

**2. Hierarchy and Face**
Vietnamese business culture values hierarchy and "saving face." Crisis communication must balance transparency with respect for leadership dignity. Publicly blaming leaders damages organizational cohesion.

**3. Government Relations**
Vietnamese companies must consider regulatory authorities as primary stakeholders in many crises (data privacy, labor issues, product safety).

**4. Social Media Dominance**
77% social media penetration means Vietnamese consumers expect real-time, informal communication on Facebook and Zalo - not just official press releases.

**5. Community and Reputation**
Collective culture means reputation damage spreads through networks quickly. Word-of-mouth (digital and traditional) can make or break crisis response.

[PURPOSE: Apply crisis principles to Vietnamese context]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Crisis communication principles are universal, but execution must adapt to Vietnamese culture"
- "Let's talk about what makes crisis communication different in Vietnam"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Apology avoidance: Traditional Vietnamese approach (ignore and hope it fades) fails in social media era
- Modern Vietnamese consumers, especially younger generation, expect transparency
- Face-saving: Can't throw leaders under the bus publicly - damages morale
- Government: More involved in Vietnamese business than Western markets
- Social media: Vietnamese consumers LIVE on Facebook and Zalo - official websites alone won't reach them

**Examples/Stories:**
- Café disability discrimination case: Organization hoped it would fade away → It didn't, social media kept it alive
- Food safety incidents: Vietnamese consumers share widely on Facebook, tag friends, create viral spread
- Contrast: Traditional Vietnamese company (official press release only) vs. modern approach (social media + website)
- ASEAN comparison: Vietnamese consumers expect more informal, frequent communication than Singapore or Japanese markets

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may be taught to avoid direct confrontation → In business, transparent crisis response is necessary
- "Saving face" doesn't mean hiding truth → It means communicating with dignity and respect
- Collective culture means your employees' families will hear about crisis → Another reason for internal communication first

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you be transparent AND respectful of hierarchy?" [Yes - focus on organizational response, not blaming individuals]
- "Why is ignoring a crisis no longer viable in Vietnam?" [Social media, 77% penetration, information spreads instantly]

**Transition:**
- "We've covered how to respond during a crisis. Now let's talk about what happens AFTER..."

TITLE: Part 4: Post-Crisis Communication & Learning

SUBTITLE: The Crisis Isn't Over When It's Over

[PURPOSE: Signal major section transition]
[TIMING: 1 minute]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The crisis may be resolved, but your work isn't done"
- "Post-crisis communication is where you rebuild trust and prevent future crises"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- This section covers post-crisis analysis and organizational learning
- Approximately 15 minutes of content

**Transition:**
- "Let's talk about what to do after the immediate crisis passes..."

---

**SLIDE 21: The Post-Crisis Analysis Process**

TITLE: Post-Crisis Analysis: Learning from the Experience

CONTENT:

**Four-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Incident Documentation (24-48 hours after resolution)**
- Create detailed timeline of crisis events
- Document all communication sent (internal and external)
- Gather stakeholder feedback and media coverage
- Record decisions made and rationale

**Step 2: Stakeholder Debrief (1 week after resolution)**
- Survey employees: What did they need that they didn't get?
- Interview key stakeholders: How did they perceive our response?
- Analyze social media sentiment and customer feedback
- Review media coverage tone and accuracy

**Step 3: Process Evaluation (2 weeks after resolution)**
- What worked well in our crisis response?
- What failed or fell short of expectations?
- Were our crisis communication plans adequate?
- Did we have the right people, tools, and authority?

**Step 4: Prevention Planning (3-4 weeks after resolution)**
- Update crisis communication plans based on lessons learned
- Implement preventive measures to avoid recurrence
- Train team members on new protocols
- Communicate improvements to stakeholders

[PURPOSE: Structure post-crisis learning]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Most organizations celebrate when the crisis ends and move on"
- "The best organizations systematically learn from every crisis"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Documentation: Memory fades quickly, write everything down within 48 hours
- Stakeholder feedback: Ask what they needed - don't assume you know
- Process evaluation: Separate what you can control (plans, training) from what you can't (the crisis itself)
- Prevention: Some crises are preventable, but all responses can improve
- This is exactly what Vietnam's disaster management authority does after natural disasters (JICA, 2024)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Tech company after server outage
  - Documented: Crisis began at 2:47 PM, first acknowledgment 3:15 PM (28 min delay - TOO SLOW)
  - Learned: Need 24/7 social media monitoring, not just business hours
  - Implemented: Hired night shift social media manager
- Positive: After food safety scare, restaurant chain implemented real-time kitchen monitoring with customer-facing cameras
- ASEAN example: Airlines after service disruptions create "crisis playbooks" for specific scenarios

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Post-crisis analysis is blaming people" → No, it's improving systems
- "We did fine, no need to review" → Every crisis teaches something, even successful responses

**Check for Understanding:**
- "When should you document the crisis timeline?" [Within 24-48 hours while memory is fresh]
- "Who should you get feedback from?" [All stakeholder groups - employees, customers, media, anyone affected]

**Transition:**
- "Post-crisis analysis is internal. But you also need external follow-up communication..."

---

**SLIDE 22: Post-Crisis Stakeholder Communication**

TITLE: Closing the Loop with Stakeholders

CONTENT:

**What to Communicate After Crisis Resolves:**

**To Employees:**
- Acknowledgment of their contribution during crisis
- What was learned and what will change
- How this experience makes the organization stronger
- Appreciation for their resilience and adaptability

**To Customers:**
- Confirmation that issue is fully resolved
- Explanation of what caused the crisis (appropriate level of detail)
- Specific actions taken to prevent recurrence
- Compensation or goodwill gesture if appropriate

**To Media/Public:**
- Transparent post-crisis report summarizing events
- Organizational changes or improvements implemented
- Reaffirmation of commitment to stakeholders
- Availability for follow-up questions

**To Government/Regulators:**
- Formal incident report with findings
- Compliance with any regulatory requirements
- Preventive measures implemented
- Ongoing monitoring plan

**Timeline:** Post-crisis communication should occur within 1-2 weeks of resolution (while still relevant) but after immediate urgency passes.

[PURPOSE: Structure post-crisis stakeholder communication]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "After the crisis ends, you need to 'close the loop' with stakeholders"
- "This is your opportunity to restore trust and demonstrate learning"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Don't just disappear when crisis ends - stakeholders want closure
- Different stakeholders need different levels of detail
- Timing matters: Too soon (looks defensive), too late (they've moved on)
- This is where you shift from "crisis response" to "trust rebuilding"

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: E-commerce platform after outage
  - Email to customers: "Here's what happened, here's how we fixed it, here's your 10% discount for the inconvenience"
  - Internal memo: "Thank you for working through the weekend. Here's what we learned and what we're changing."
- Good example: Company publishes transparent incident report on blog
- Bad example: Company goes silent after crisis ends → Customers assume they're hiding something
- ASEAN example: Financial services company after data breach - published detailed security improvement plan

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Bringing it up again reminds people of the crisis" → No, closure builds trust
- "We don't owe them an explanation" → Yes you do - stakeholders deserve to know what you learned

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the risk of NOT communicating after crisis ends?" [Stakeholders assume you didn't learn anything, trust isn't rebuilt]
- "Should post-crisis communication be different for employees vs. customers?" [Yes - employees deserve more detail and appreciation]

**Transition:**
- "We've covered the entire crisis lifecycle. Let's look at how organizations prepare BEFORE crises strike..."

**SLIDE 23: Crisis Preparedness Framework**

TITLE: Framework: Building Crisis Readiness

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

CONTENT:

**Four Pillars of Crisis Preparedness:**

**Pillar 1: Crisis Communication Plan**
Documented protocols for who communicates what, through which channels, to which stakeholders. Include contact lists, holding statement templates, channel access credentials.

**Pillar 2: Designated Crisis Team**
Identified team members with defined roles: spokesperson, social media manager, internal communicator, stakeholder liaison. Train them quarterly.

**Pillar 3: Monitoring Systems**
24/7 social media monitoring, media alerts, customer feedback channels, employee reporting mechanisms. Early detection prevents escalation.

**Pillar 4: Scenario Planning**
Pre-developed response plans for likely crisis scenarios (e.g., data breach, product recall, workplace accident, social media backlash). Practice with simulation exercises.

**Testing Requirement:** Crisis plans must be tested annually through tabletop exercises or simulations. Plans that aren't practiced will fail under pressure.

[PURPOSE: Provide preparedness framework]
[TIMING: 5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The best crisis response begins before the crisis happens"
- "Argenti's principle 4: Have a plan in place - let's break down what that means"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Crisis plan: Must be documented, accessible, and up-to-date (not gathering dust in a drawer)
- Crisis team: Can't assign roles during crisis - decide in advance, train regularly
- Monitoring: Vietnamese companies often lack 24/7 monitoring - crisis can start at 2 AM
- Scenario planning: Can't plan for every crisis, but can plan for categories (tech, HR, product, etc.)
- Testing: Plans look good on paper but fail in practice without rehearsal

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnam example: Tech startup holds quarterly "crisis simulation day"
  - Scenario: Simulated data breach at 9 AM Friday
  - Team practices entire response: holding statement, employee communication, customer notification
  - Finds gaps: Social media manager doesn't have login credentials, legal team takes too long to approve messages
- ASEAN example: Singapore Airlines conducts crisis drills for various scenarios
- Bad example: Company has 50-page crisis plan that no one has read or practiced

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "We're too small to need a crisis plan" → Size doesn't matter, crises happen to all organizations
- "Crisis planning is just for big disasters" → No, includes social media backlash, employee incidents, etc.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the minimum crisis team for a small company?" [Minimum 3: someone for internal communication, someone for external, someone for social media]
- "How often should you test your crisis plan?" [At least annually, ideally quarterly]

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at a real Vietnamese business example of crisis communication in action..."

**SLIDE 24: Case Study - Vietnamese Business Crisis Response**

TITLE: Case Study: Café Disability Discrimination Incident

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

CONTENT:

**The Crisis:**
A Vietnamese café franchise was accused of discriminating against a disabled person through a Facebook post. The public outrage grew rapidly on social media.

**What Happened:**
- Accusation posted on Facebook → Viral spread within hours
- Company initially ignored the situation (traditional Vietnamese approach)
- Public anger intensified as company remained silent
- Victim updated situation on his personal Facebook account
- Only after victim's update did public sentiment cool down

**Analysis Using Today's Frameworks:**

**Speed:** Company was too slow (Argenti's Principle 2: Choose channels) ✗
**Accuracy:** Company didn't establish facts or share their perspective ✗
**Empathy:** No acknowledgment of victim's experience ✗
**Stakeholder Adaptation:** Ignored social media channel where crisis emerged ✗
**Cultural Context:** Applied old "ignore it" strategy that no longer works ✗

**What Should Have Happened:**
1. **Immediate (30 min):** Holding statement on Facebook: "We're aware of this situation and investigating immediately. Inclusion and respect are our core values."
2. **Short-term (3 hours):** Update with facts and action: "We've spoken with all involved. Here's what happened and here's how we're addressing it."
3. **Follow-up:** Policy changes to prevent recurrence, staff training on accessibility

[TIMING: 6 minutes]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's analyze a real Vietnamese crisis using today's frameworks"
- "This case shows exactly what NOT to do - and why traditional approaches fail"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Speed failure: Ignoring crisis allowed it to escalate unchecked
- Channel failure: Crisis was on Facebook, but company didn't use Facebook to respond
- Traditional Vietnamese approach (ignore, hope it fades) documented by research as common but ineffective
- The victim had to solve it himself by posting update - company lost control of narrative
- This violated every principle: speed, accuracy, empathy, stakeholder adaptation

**Examples/Stories:**
- Connect to today's frameworks:
  - Argenti: Get on the scene → Company was invisible ✗
  - Speed vs. Accuracy: Too slow, never even tried ✗
  - Three Pillars: No speed, no accuracy, no empathy ✗
  - Stakeholder Adaptation: Wrong channel (or no channel) ✗
- Contrast with what SHOULD have happened (tiered response)
- Similar Vietnamese cases: Food safety incidents where silence made it worse

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students might think ignoring is "polite" or avoids confrontation
- Emphasize: Modern Vietnamese consumers, especially young people, expect transparency
- "Saving face" by ignoring crisis actually LOSES more face than honest response

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What was the company's biggest mistake?" [Staying silent - violates speed principle]
- "Which stakeholder group did they ignore?" [Customers on social media - their primary audience]
- "If you were the café manager, what would your first action be?" [Facebook post within 30 min acknowledging situation]

**Transition:**
- "This case shows what NOT to do. Now let's synthesize everything we've learned..."

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "We've covered a lot of frameworks and principles today"
- "Let's synthesize the key takeaways you need to remember for Quiz 2 and for your careers"

**Transition:**
- "Here are the five critical lessons from today..."

---

**SLIDE 26: Five Critical Lessons**

TITLE: Five Critical Crisis Communication Lessons

CONTENT:

**1. Speed + Accuracy + Empathy (The Three Pillars)**
Respond within 15-30 minutes with holding statement. Share only verified information. Show genuine care for those affected. All three are required for effective crisis response.

**2. Employees First, Then Externals**
Internal communication precedes external announcements. Employees become your ambassadors or critics based on how you treat them (Argenti, 2002).

**3. Tiered Response Solves Speed vs. Accuracy**
Immediate: Acknowledge (5-15 min). Short-term: Initial findings (1-3 hours). Medium-term: Detailed response (24-48 hours). Long-term: Post-crisis analysis (1-2 weeks).

**4. Adapt Messages to Stakeholder Needs**
Employees need business status and personal impact. Customers need acknowledgment and action. Government needs compliance. Media needs facts. One message doesn't fit all.

**5. Social Media Is Primary Channel in Vietnam**
77% social media penetration means Facebook and Zalo are crisis battlegrounds, not optional channels. Vietnamese consumers expect real-time, informal updates.

[PURPOSE: Synthesize key learnings]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These five lessons summarize everything we've covered today"
- "Write these down - they're testable on Quiz 2 and applicable throughout your career"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Lesson 1: Can't have two of three - need all three pillars
- Lesson 2: Argenti's most important principle based on 9/11 research
- Lesson 3: Solves the central tension - you CAN be fast and accurate
- Lesson 4: Different stakeholders = different information needs
- Lesson 5: Vietnam-specific - social media isn't optional here

**Examples/Stories:**
- Quick recall of examples from today:
  - Three Pillars: 74% expect one-hour response (speed), verify before sharing (accuracy), show you care (empathy)
  - Employees first: Dell's internal website, Starbucks opening stores
  - Tiered response: E-commerce platform example
  - Stakeholder adaptation: Employees need different info than customers
  - Social media: Café case study, 77% penetration

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which pillar do organizations most often forget?" [Empathy - they focus on speed and facts, forget to show they care]
- "What's the risk of communicating externally before internally?" [Employees feel disrespected, become critics instead of ambassadors]

**Transition:**
- "Let's preview what you'll practice in today's tutorial..."
