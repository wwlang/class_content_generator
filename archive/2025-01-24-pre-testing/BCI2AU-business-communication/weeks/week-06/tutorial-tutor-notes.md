## Quiz Solutions

### Question 1: Crisis Definition
**Correct: A**

**Why A is correct:**
Lecture defined a crisis using exactly these three characteristics: (1) Threat to organization - significant potential for negative consequences; (2) Surprise element - often unexpected with limited decision time; (3) Short decision time - requires rapid response. This definition was presented on Slide 7 with the formula "Crisis = Threat + Surprise + Short Time."

**Why wrong:**
- B: These are potential OUTCOMES of crises, not defining characteristics. Not all crises involve financial loss or media attention.
- C: These are consequences, not defining features. Crises can occur without legal liability or employee turnover.
- D: These are modern crisis manifestations, but don't define what makes something a crisis vs. a regular problem.

**Common confusion:** Students conflate crisis outcomes (what happens) with crisis characteristics (what defines it). Emphasize: many problems have negative outcomes, but only crises have threat + surprise + short time together.

**Teaching tip:** Use the analogy: "A flat tire is a problem. A tire blowout at 100 km/h is a crisis. Why? Same outcome (flat tire), but crisis has surprise + threat + short decision time."

### Question 2: Argenti's Framework
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Argenti's Principle 3 explicitly states "Communicate with Employees First" - internal employee communication must precede all external announcements. This was emphasized on Slide 9 and reinforced throughout lecture with the quote "Organizations face 'a human crisis' requiring focus on people before customers or investors."

**Why wrong:**
- A: "Get on the Scene" refers to leadership visibility during crises, not communication sequencing.
- B: "Choose Your Channels Carefully" is about using multiple communication channels (voice mail, website, social media), not who to communicate with first.
- D: "Have a Plan in Place" refers to crisis preparedness (contingency sites, backup communication infrastructure), not communication order.

**Common confusion:** Students remember all five principles but mix up which principle addresses which aspect of crisis response. The key word here is "precede" - that's sequencing, which is Principle 3.

**Teaching tip:** Ask: "Why employees first?" Answer: They're your frontline, they'll be asked questions, they become ambassadors or critics based on how you treat them. If they learn from media, they feel disrespected.

### Question 3: Speed Expectations
**Correct: D**

**Why D is correct:**
Lecture Slide 11 featured this exact statistic from American Red Cross (2012): "74% of people expect organizations to respond within ONE HOUR on social media during a crisis." This was the big number slide emphasizing the collapse of the "golden hour."

**Why wrong:**
- A, B, C: These are plausible percentages but not the actual research finding cited in lecture.

**Common confusion:** Students remember "most people expect fast response" but not the specific percentage. Emphasize: 74% is a supermajority - you can't ignore this expectation.

**Teaching tip:** Connect to Vietnamese context: "In Vietnam with 77% social media penetration, this expectation is even HIGHER. Vietnamese consumers expect response in 15-30 minutes, not hours."

### Question 4: Three Pillars
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
The Three Pillars framework was presented on Slide 13: Speed (respond within 15-30 minutes), Accuracy (share only verified information), and Empathy (show genuine care for those affected). Lecture emphasized all three are REQUIRED, not optional.

**Why wrong:**
- A: These are crisis management phases, not the Three Pillars of response quality.
- C: These are stakeholder categories, not response pillars.
- D: These are elements of crisis messages, but not the Three Pillars framework from lecture.

**Common confusion:** Students remember "three things matter in crisis" but mix up which framework. The Three Pillars are about response QUALITY (how you respond), not process (when you respond) or audience (who you respond to).

**Teaching tip:** Hand motion: Hold up three fingers. "Speed" (1st finger), "Accuracy" (2nd finger), "Empathy" (3rd finger). Ask: "Can you have just two? No - all three required."

### Question 5: Tiered Response
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Lecture Slide 12 explained tiered response: "Immediate (5-15 min): Holding statement - 'We're aware and investigating.'" Purpose is to ACKNOWLEDGE the situation and COMMIT to providing updates, not to provide complete details (that comes in later tiers).

**Why wrong:**
- A: Complete details come in medium-term response (24-48 hours), not holding statement. The point of holding statement is you DON'T have complete info yet.
- C: Assigning blame and taking full responsibility is not appropriate for a holding statement issued within 15 minutes - you haven't investigated yet.
- D: Announcing resolution happens only after crisis is actually resolved, which is not within 15 minutes.

**Common confusion:** Students think holding statements should contain more information. Clarify: Holding statement = "We know + We care + We're working on it + We'll update you." That's it. Details come later.

**Teaching tip:** Analogy: "If your friend texts 'Emergency, need help,' you don't write a 500-word response plan. You reply immediately: 'I'm here, what do you need, I'll help.' That's a holding statement."

### Question 6: Stakeholder Prioritization
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Argenti's Principle 3 (Slide 9): "Communicate with Employees First - Internal communication must precede external statements." Slide 16 reinforced: "Priority Rule: Communicate with internal stakeholders FIRST, before external announcements (Argenti, 2002)."

**Why wrong:**
- A: Customers are external stakeholders - they come AFTER employees.
- B: Media are external stakeholders - definitely after employees.
- D: Investors are external stakeholders - after employees.

**Common confusion:** Students think "customers pay our salaries, so customers first." Clarify: Employees are your front line. If they learn from media, they feel disrespected and become critics. Dell example from lecture: 54,947 internal website hits with 90% positive because employees were informed first.

**Teaching tip:** Scenario: "Your company has a data breach. Your customer service team is fielding calls. Should they learn about the breach from customers calling in (because you told customers first)? Or should they already know so they can provide accurate information?"

### Question 7: Vietnamese Context
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Slide 19 (Vietnamese Context) quoted EloQ (2021) research: "Apology is the least-used strategy among Vietnamese organizations. Companies tend to ignore crises hoping they will fade away, but social media prevents this approach from working."

**Why wrong:**
- A: Social media monitoring wasn't identified as least-used (though lecture noted Vietnamese companies often lack 24/7 monitoring).
- B: Press releases are commonly used by Vietnamese companies (lecture noted they use press releases but forget social media).
- D: Legal consultation wasn't discussed as least-used strategy.

**Common confusion:** Students might think Vietnamese companies don't use social media (A) because lecture said they neglect it. Clarify: They use official websites and press releases but neglect SOCIAL MEDIA specifically. Apology is the strategy they avoid.

**Teaching tip:** Connect to Vietnamese cultural context: "Why do Vietnamese organizations avoid apology? Face-saving culture, hierarchy respect, fear of liability. But modern Vietnamese consumers, especially young people, expect transparency and accountability. The old approach no longer works."

### Question 8: Social Media Crisis Management
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
Slide 18 (Social Media Crisis Management) listed best practices, including: "Respond publicly AND privately (DMs for individual concerns)." This balances transparency (public response) with personalized support (private DMs).

**Why wrong:**
- A: Slide 18 explicitly said "Don't delete negative comments (shows you're hiding)." Deletion creates screenshot evidence and proves guilt.
- B: This violates speed principle - you should issue holding statement within 15 minutes, not wait for complete information.
- D: During crisis, more frequent updates are better (every 1-3 hours in active crisis phase), not once per day.

**Common confusion:** Students think private DMs mean "hide the conversation." Clarify: Respond publicly to acknowledge (shows transparency), then move to DMs for personal details like account numbers, specific case resolution.

**Teaching tip:** Example: "Customer tweets: 'Your product broke and customer service won't help!' You reply publicly: 'We're sorry to hear this. Please DM us your order number so we can resolve this.' Then handle specifics privately. Public = you care, Private = specific resolution."

---

### Question 9: Crisis Types
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Slide 8 defined six crisis categories. Food contamination = Product/Service Failure crisis. Social media backlash = Reputational crisis. Lecture emphasized: "One crisis type can span multiple categories. Example: Data breach (technological) quickly becomes reputational crisis."

**Why wrong:**
- A: No technological or financial elements in this scenario.
- C: No human resource issue (not employee-related) or natural disaster (not external force).
- D: No financial crisis or HR crisis.

**Common confusion:** Students pick only one crisis type, forgetting that crises can span multiple categories. Food contamination is the PRIMARY crisis (product), but social media backlash creates a SECONDARY reputational crisis.

**Teaching tip:** Draw Venn diagram on board showing crisis type overlap. Ask: "Can a crisis be multiple types at once?" Yes. "Does it change your response?" Yes - product crisis needs technical accuracy, reputational crisis needs speed and empathy on social media.

### Question 10: Post-Crisis Communication
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Slide 22 specified: "Timeline: Post-crisis communication should occur within 1-2 weeks of resolution (while still relevant) but after immediate urgency passes."

**Why wrong:**
- A: Immediately (same day) is too soon - you haven't had time for proper analysis and learning.
- C: One month is too late - stakeholders have moved on, communication loses relevance.
- D: Waiting for stakeholders to request it is passive - you should proactively close the loop.

**Common confusion:** Students think post-crisis communication is optional or reactive. Clarify: It's proactive and strategic - this is where you rebuild trust and demonstrate learning.

**Teaching tip:** Analogy: "After a medical emergency, doctors don't just discharge you. They schedule follow-up: 'Here's what happened, here's what we learned, here's how we're preventing it next time.' Same with crisis communication - close the loop."

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

This activity asks students to design a multi-stakeholder crisis communication plan for a realistic technology security scenario. The VietTech Solutions case is deliberately open-ended with multiple valid approaches - students must make strategic decisions about stakeholder prioritization, channel selection, message adaptation, and timing. The goal is application of frameworks (Argenti, Three Pillars, Tiered Response), not finding "the one right answer."

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- **Applies Argenti's "employees first" principle:** Internal communication precedes external announcements, with clear rationale
- **Uses tiered response structure:** Holding statement (5-15 min) → Initial update (1-3 hours) → Detailed response (24 hours), showing progression of information
- **Adapts messages for stakeholder groups:** Employee message focuses on business status and personal impact; client message acknowledges risk and commits to action; media statement provides facts without speculation
- **Incorporates all Three Pillars:** Speed (specific timestamps showing rapid response), Accuracy (acknowledges what's known vs. unknown, no speculation), Empathy (shows genuine concern for affected parties)
- **Strategic channel selection:** Uses email for employees (internal, detailed), social media for public/customers (immediate, transparent), direct calls for key clients (personalized), press release for media (authoritative)

**Critical Moments:**

**During Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes):** Students will struggle most with stakeholder adaptation - writing different messages for different audiences. Around the 10-minute mark, circulate and check: Are pairs writing identical messages for all stakeholders, or are they adapting? If you see copy-paste messages, prompt: "What does an employee need to know that a customer doesn't? What does a customer care about that media doesn't?" Vietnamese students may default to formal, identical messages across all audiences due to cultural emphasis on consistency and risk aversion. Encourage: "Different stakeholders have different needs - it's okay to customize messages. That's strategic, not inconsistent."

**During Peer Review (15 minutes):** Students may focus on grammar and wording rather than strategic application of frameworks. Redirect peer reviewers: "Don't focus on perfect sentences. Ask: Did they apply the Three Pillars? Did they communicate with employees first? Did they use tiered response timing?" Vietnamese students may be hesitant to give critical feedback to peers (face-saving culture). Frame peer review as "comparing strategies and approaches" rather than "finding mistakes." Provide sentence starters in tutorial content to reduce discomfort. If you notice pairs saying only positive things with no suggestions, prompt: "What would you do DIFFERENTLY in your approach? Share that as an alternative strategy."

**During Debrief (5 minutes):** This is where you draw out the key learning. Ask: "Who communicated with employees first? Raise hands." Then: "Who went external first? Why?" Surface the variety of approaches: Some will prioritize clients (feeling pressure to protect business relationships), others will prioritize employees (applying Argenti correctly). Don't judge immediately - ask students to defend their choices using frameworks. THEN connect to Argenti's research: "The research shows employees first because they're your front line. If they learn from clients calling in, they feel disrespected and become critics on social media." Draw out Vietnamese context: "In collectivist culture, word-of-mouth spreads fast. If your employees feel disrespected, their families and networks hear about it. Internal communication isn't just nice - it's strategic."

**Timing Flexibility:**

The main activity is designed for 55 minutes (25 individual/pair + 15 peer review + 15 revision/debrief), but you may find students need more time for the design phase or want extended debrief discussion. If you're running long at 50 minutes into tutorial, you have two options: (1) Shorten revision time to 5 minutes and debrief to 5 minutes (total 10 min), giving you 60 minutes for activity + 15-20 for quiz practice; or (2) Assign quiz practice as homework with answer key provided, allowing full 70 minutes for the activity. The activity is where the deep learning happens - prioritize it over quiz practice if you must choose. Quiz practice can be self-directed with answer key, but the case analysis requires facilitated discussion.
