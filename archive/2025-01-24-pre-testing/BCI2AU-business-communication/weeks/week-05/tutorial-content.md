## OPENING (10 minutes)

### Quick Concept Review

**Three Key Concepts from Lecture:**

1. **AI Is a Tool, Not a Replacement for Thinking**
   - Research shows 14% productivity gain, 35% for beginners (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023)
   - Your value = Strategic thinking + Cultural intelligence + Authentic voice

2. **Four Ethical Principles for AI Use**
   - Transparency: Disclose AI use appropriately
   - Accountability: You own the results
   - Authenticity: Preserve your unique voice
   - Skill Development: Learn from AI, don't depend on it

3. **Strategic Decision Framework**
   - Use AI when: Efficiency matters + You can verify output
   - Do it yourself when: Authenticity + Deep context + High stakes matter most

## MAIN ACTIVITY: AI Ethics Case Analysis (55 minutes)

### The Scenario

You're a junior business analyst at **VinaTech Solutions**, a Vietnamese technology consulting firm with international clients. You frequently communicate with both Vietnamese and international stakeholders.

Over the past month, you've been using AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grammarly) to help with business communication tasks. Your manager has noticed and asked you to document your AI use practices for the team's new "Ethical AI Guidelines."

**Your task:** Analyze four real business communication situations you faced this month. For each scenario, evaluate your AI use decisions and recommend best practices.

**Note:** There may be multiple valid approaches depending on your priorities and risk tolerance. What matters most is your ethical reasoning and understanding of tradeoffs.

---

### The Scenarios & Materials

**SCENARIO 1: Client Proposal with Sensitive Data**

**Context:**
You're writing a proposal to **FPT Corporation** (Vietnamese client) recommending cloud migration strategy for their customer database (contains 2 million customer records with personal data).

**What You Did:**
- Copied actual client database schema and migration plan into ChatGPT
- Asked: "Write professional proposal recommending this cloud migration, include ROI analysis and risk mitigation"
- ChatGPT generated 4-page proposal
- You edited company names and submitted to client

**Result:** Client accepted proposal, project moving forward.

---

**SCENARIO 2: Crisis Communication Under Time Pressure**

**Context:**
VinaTech's project delivery to international client delayed 2 weeks due to unexpected technical issues. Client sent angry email at 5:00 PM threatening contract cancellation if no response by 9:00 AM next day (16 hours). You're the assigned project manager.

**What You Did:**
- 5:30 PM: Asked ChatGPT: "Write crisis communication email apologizing for delay, explaining technical issues, offering solutions"
- ChatGPT generated empathetic response
- 6:00 PM: You reviewed quickly, changed a few words, sent to client
- Didn't verify technical explanation accuracy (assumed AI was correct)
- Didn't consult with technical team or legal department

**Result:** Client accepted explanation but later discovered technical details in email were partially incorrect.

---

**SCENARIO 3: Cross-Cultural Email to Vietnamese Business Partner**

**Context:**
You need to inform **Viettel** (state-owned Vietnamese telecom company) that VinaTech cannot attend important partnership meeting next week due to scheduling conflict. This is sensitive—Viettel is high-status partner, relationship-oriented culture, and your CEO personally committed to attend.

**What You Did:**
- Asked ChatGPT: "Write professional email declining meeting invitation"
- ChatGPT generated direct, Western-style email: "We cannot attend the meeting on May 15 due to scheduling conflicts. Please reschedule."
- You added "Dear Mr. Nguyen" and "Best regards" but kept AI's direct tone
- Sent without adding relationship language or face-saving elements

**Result:** Viettel partner seemed offended (short, cold response), relationship tension increased.

---

**SCENARIO 4: LinkedIn Post About Industry Controversy**

**Context:**
Recent news: Major tech company accused of using AI to write employee performance reviews without disclosure. Industry debate about AI transparency. Your manager suggested you (as emerging AI expert) write LinkedIn post sharing VinaTech's perspective.

**What You Did:**
- Asked ChatGPT: "Write LinkedIn post about ethics of AI in workplace communication, share balanced perspective"
- ChatGPT generated 300-word thoughtful post with 3 key principles
- You posted directly without adding personal experience or VinaTech-specific examples
- Did not disclose that AI wrote the post about AI ethics

**Result:** Post got good engagement, but one commenter asked: "Did you practice what you preach? Did AI write this post about AI ethics?"

### Individual/Pair Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:** Complete the AI Ethics Analysis Worksheet for all four scenarios.

**For each scenario, analyze:**

1. **Ethical Issues**: Which of the 4 ethical principles were violated or upheld?
   - Transparency: Was AI use disclosed appropriately?
   - Accountability: Who owns the outcome? Were facts verified?
   - Authenticity: Was authentic voice and expertise evident?
   - Skill Development: Did this help or hinder learning?

2. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong (or did go wrong)?
   - Data privacy breaches?
   - Factual errors?
   - Damaged relationships?
   - Reputational harm?
   - Legal liability?

3. **Decision Framework**: Should AI have been used differently?
   - Refer to lecture Slide 20: When to use AI vs. when not to
   - What's the appropriate level of AI assistance for this situation?

4. **Better Approach**: How would you handle this situation ethically?
   - Specific workflow steps
   - What YOU do vs. what AI does
   - Disclosure approach
   - Verification steps

**Worksheet Format:**

```
SCENARIO [#]: [Title]

Ethical Issues:
- Transparency: [Analysis]
- Accountability: [Analysis]
- Authenticity: [Analysis]
- Skill Development: [Analysis]

Risk Assessment:
- What went wrong or could go wrong: [List specific risks]
- Severity (Low/Medium/High): [Rating with justification]

Decision Framework:
- Should AI have been used? [Yes/No/Differently - explain]
- Appropriate AI role: [None / Brainstorm / Draft / Polish / Other]

Better Approach:
[Step-by-step workflow showing ethical AI use, including what you verify, what you add, how you disclose]
```

**Considerations:**
- Think about Vietnamese business culture for Scenario 3
- Consider data privacy regulations for Scenario 1
- Balance speed vs. accuracy for Scenario 2
- Reflect on irony of Scenario 4 (AI writing about AI ethics)

---

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**Exchange worksheets with another pair.**

**Review using these criteria:**

- [ ] **Ethical Analysis**: Did they identify all relevant ethical issues for each scenario?
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Are risks realistic and severity ratings justified?
- [ ] **Decision Framework**: Is the "should AI be used?" reasoning clear and logical?
- [ ] **Better Approach**: Is the recommended workflow specific, actionable, and ethical?

**Provide feedback:**

**One specific strength:** "I appreciated how you [specific analysis or insight]..."

**One area to strengthen:** "For Scenario [#], you could strengthen your analysis by considering [specific factor]..."

**Different perspective:** "For Scenario [#], I took a different approach: [brief explanation]. What do you think of that alternative?"

**Remember:** Multiple valid approaches exist depending on priorities (efficiency vs. risk mitigation vs. authenticity). Compare reasoning, don't critique differences as "wrong."

---

### Revision & Debrief (15 minutes)

**Revision (10 minutes):**

Review peer feedback and strengthen your analysis. Focus on:
- Adding ethical considerations you missed
- Clarifying your reasoning for controversial decisions
- Ensuring "Better Approach" is specific and actionable

**You don't need to change your approach if you disagree with peer feedback—but be able to defend your reasoning.**

**Class Debrief (5 minutes):**

Instructor will lead discussion on:
- Most controversial scenario (where did perspectives differ most?)
- Common ethical pitfalls identified
- Best practices that emerged across all analyses
- How these lessons apply to your Written Portfolio

## WRAP-UP (5 minutes)

### Self-Assessment Against Rubric

**Reflect on these questions:**

**For your Written Portfolio due this week:**

1. **Strategic Framework Application**: Have you explicitly applied course frameworks (Cialdini's principles, BLUF, crisis communication principles, audience analysis) in your portfolio pieces?
   - Can you point to specific examples of framework application?
   - If you used AI, did AI apply the frameworks or did YOU?

2. **Appropriate Tone & Audience Adaptation**: Does your tone match the audience and cultural context?
   - Email Series: Professional and audience-appropriate?
   - Persuasive Proposal: Right level of formality and persuasion?
   - Crisis Communication: Empathetic, transparent, action-oriented?

3. **Authenticity & Voice**: Does your portfolio reflect YOUR thinking and expertise?
   - Can only YOU have written this (specific examples, insights, context)?
   - Or could anyone with AI have produced this?

4. **Ethical Disclosure**: Have you disclosed AI use appropriately?
   - If you used AI beyond grammar checking, did you document what role it played?
   - Is your disclosure specific about what AI did vs. what you did?

**Rate yourself (1-5 scale):**
- 5 = Excellent (rubric "Excellent" level)
- 4 = Good (rubric "Good" level)
- 3 = Satisfactory (rubric "Satisfactory" level)
- 2 = Needs improvement
- 1 = Significant revision needed

**If you rated yourself below 4 on any criterion, what will you revise before submission?**

---

### What to Revise Before Portfolio Submission

**Common Revisions Needed:**

**If Strategic Framework Application is weak:**
- Add explicit references to course frameworks by name
- Show WHY you chose specific persuasion principles (Cialdini)
- Demonstrate audience analysis thinking
- Apply BLUF structure clearly in emails
- Reference crisis communication principles explicitly

**If Tone is inappropriate:**
- Review for formality level (too casual or too formal?)
- Check Vietnamese cultural elements if relevant audience
- Ensure empathy in crisis communication
- Verify confidence without arrogance in persuasive proposal

**If Authenticity is lacking:**
- Add specific examples only you would know
- Include your analytical insights (not generic AI logic)
- Reference personal or company-specific context
- Ensure your unique voice comes through

**If Disclosure is missing:**
- Add AI disclosure statement if you used AI beyond grammar checking
- Be specific: What tool, what role, what YOU contributed

---

### Next Steps for Assessment Preparation

**Before Portfolio Submission (This Week):**
- [ ] Verify all facts, sources, statistics (check for AI hallucinations)
