# Week 9 Tutorial: Tutor Notes

**Course:** Business Communication (BCI2AU)
**Tutorial:** Presentations Part I - Design & Structure
**Duration:** 90 minutes

---

## Tutorial Goals

- Provide hands-on practice with presentation storyboarding using evidence-based frameworks from lecture
- Prepare students for Week 11 Group Presentation design requirements
- Build confidence in applying storytelling structures, slide design principles, and opening/closing techniques

## Key Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, students should be able to:
- Create a complete presentation storyboard that demonstrates strategic structure choice (Duarte vs. rule of three based on purpose)
- Apply cognitive load principles to plan slide content (≤6 elements, one idea per slide, graphics over text)
- Craft compelling opening hooks using one of five techniques taught in lecture
- Design specific, achievable calls-to-action with three-part structure (synthesize, inspire, direct)

## Quiz Solutions

### Question 1: Anderson's Three Elements
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Chris Anderson's core principle states "Presentations rise or fall on the quality of the idea, the narrative, and the passion of the speaker." This was emphasized as the foundational principle - substance over style. Reference: Lecture Slide 7.

**Why wrong:**
- A: These are delivery mechanics, not Anderson's core elements
- C: These are supporting elements, not the three he identified as primary
- D: These are structural components, not Anderson's foundation

**Common confusion:** Students may confuse structural elements (hook, body, CTA) with Anderson's foundational principle (idea, narrative, passion).

**Teaching tip:** Remind students: "Before you worry about slides or delivery, ask: Do I have a compelling IDEA? Can I structure it as a NARRATIVE? Am I genuinely PASSIONATE about it?"

### Question 2: Duarte's Structure Purpose
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Duarte's "What is/What could be" framework explicitly creates tension by contrasting current painful reality with improved future possibility. This contrast is what makes it persuasive - the gap creates energy for change. Reference: Lecture Slide 10.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Not chronological - alternates between present and future possibility
- C: Not traditional thesis/evidence - uses emotional contrast
- D: Not character-driven story - focuses on states (current vs. future)

**Common confusion:** Students may think any alternating structure = Duarte, but it specifically alternates reality with possibility to create tension.

**Teaching tip:** Use simple diagram: "What is ↔ What could be ↔ What is ↔ What could be → New Bliss. The back-and-forth creates growing desire for the 'could be' state."

### Question 3: Cognitive Load Increase
**Correct: D**

**Why D is correct:**
The research by Krammer et al. (2021) specifically states: "the human brain can easily interpret 6 elements and more than that requires a 500% increase in human cognition load." This dramatic statistic explains why slides with 10+ bullet points overwhelm audiences. Reference: Lecture Slide 15.

**Why wrong:**
- A, B, C: All underestimate the cognitive burden - it's much more dramatic than 100-300%

**Common confusion:** The number seems extreme, which is the point - cognitive overload is a massive barrier to comprehension.

**Teaching tip:** Demonstrate with example: "Show a slide with 12 complex bullet points and ask students to read it while you talk. They'll realize they can't process both - that's the 500% overload in action."

---

### Question 4: One Minute Per Slide Rule
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
The "one minute per slide" rule from Krammer et al. (2021) is a pacing guideline: a 20-minute presentation should have approximately 20 slides. This helps with planning and maintains audience engagement through regular fresh information. Reference: Lecture Slide 16.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Not about video content duration
- C: Not about audience reading time - slides shouldn't require reading
- D: Not about forced transitions - natural pacing

**Common confusion:** Students may interpret literally as "exactly 60 seconds per slide" when it's actually a rough planning guideline.

**Teaching tip:** Clarify: "Some slides may take 30 seconds, others 90 seconds, but AVERAGE should be ~1 minute. For your 15-minute Group Presentation, aim for ~15 slides."

### Question 5: Meaningful Headlines
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
"Sales increased 40% after campaign launch" is a meaningful headline - it states the conclusion/insight of the slide, not a generic category. This follows Rule #3 from the Ten Simple Rules: transform generic titles into specific conclusions. Reference: Lecture Slide 16.

**Why wrong:**
- A, B, D: All generic category labels that don't tell audience the slide's conclusion

**Common confusion:** Students default to generic section labels ("Results," "Analysis") instead of stating the actual finding.

**Teaching tip:** Ask: "If someone only read your slide titles without seeing content, would they understand your main points? Good headlines = yes. Generic labels = no."

### Question 6: Reading and Listening Cognitive Conflict
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
Reading text and listening to speech both require language processing in the same cognitive channel, creating competition and overload. The research explains this is why "Death by PowerPoint" (text-heavy slides read aloud) fails - audiences must choose: read OR listen, can't do both effectively. Reference: Lecture Slide 17.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Reading is visual, but the processing is linguistic, not purely visual
- C: True but not the specific mechanism - doesn't explain WHY multitasking fails here
- D: Distraction is a symptom, not the cognitive mechanism

**Common confusion:** Students may think the problem is visual competition when it's actually linguistic processing competition.

**Teaching tip:** Explain: "Your brain has separate channels for visual (images) and auditory (speech), but reading and listening BOTH use the language channel. That's why image + speech works, but text + speech conflicts."

### Question 7: Three-Part CTA Structure
**Correct: C**

**Why C is correct:**
The lecture taught effective CTAs have three parts: (1) Synthesize - reinforce 2-3 key takeaways, (2) Inspire - paint "new bliss" vision of transformed future, (3) Direct - specific action to take. This structure moves from summary to vision to concrete next steps. Reference: Lecture Slide 21.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Too generic and passive - doesn't inspire or direct
- B: Close but doesn't include inspirational vision component
- D: Too abstract - lacks specific direction

**Common confusion:** Students may think a simple summary + "thank you" is sufficient closing.

**Teaching tip:** Use analogy: "Think of CTA like landing an airplane - you don't just stop flying (summarize), you guide them to specific destination (inspire), then tell them which gate to go to (direct)."

### Question 8: Why Avoid Animations
**Correct: B**

**Why B is correct:**
The research explicitly states: survey research shows "no one likes them," they create processing burdens for visually impaired audiences (accessibility issues), and introduce software compatibility risks. All three reasons combined make animations a poor choice. Reference: Lecture Slide 18.

**Why wrong:**
- A: Not about professionalism - can look professional but still problematic
- C: Not primarily about delivery speed
- D: They're actually easy to create - that's part of the problem (overuse)

**Common confusion:** Many students think animations make presentations more engaging, contrary to research findings.

**Teaching tip:** Acknowledge: "This surprises many people - we think animations are engaging. But research shows audiences find them distracting and they create real accessibility problems. Simple, clean slides are more effective."

## Facilitating the Main Activity

**Context:**

The storyboarding activity is deliberately open-ended to mirror the real creative process students will use for their Group Presentations. Unlike Week 2's BLUF email exercise (which had one optimal structure), this activity has multiple valid approaches - persuasive presentations might use Duarte structure while informative ones might use rule of three. The goal is for students to make strategic choices aligned with their purpose and defend those choices with reasoning from lecture frameworks.

**What Good Work Looks Like:**

- **Clear purpose definition:** Student explicitly chooses persuade, inform, or inspire as primary purpose and structure aligns with that choice (Duarte for persuasive, rule of three for informative)
- **Strong opening hook:** Uses one of five techniques from lecture (provocative question, surprising statistic, story, bold statement, visual) - creates genuine tension or curiosity, not generic "Today I'll talk about..."
- **Cognitive load awareness:** Each slide planned with ≤6 elements, one main idea, identifies potential visual/graphic support
- **Specific CTA:** Three-part structure evident (synthesize, inspire, direct) with concrete achievable action, not vague "let me know if you have questions"
- **Vietnamese context integration:** Considers audience (junior employees at VNG/FPT-type company), culturally relevant examples, local business practices

**Critical Moments:**

**During Individual Work (25 minutes):** Monitor for students who spend too long choosing topics (decision paralysis) or rush through without applying frameworks. Around the 5-minute mark, ensure everyone has chosen a topic and defined their purpose - this is the foundation for everything else. At the 15-minute mark, check that students are working on their hook and CTA, not just the body slides. Many students will focus entirely on body content and leave opening/closing as afterthoughts - redirect them. Vietnamese students may need encouragement to make bold choices (provocative hooks, inspirational CTAs) as cultural norms emphasize modesty - validate that professional presentations require some boldness. If a student seems stuck, ask: "What's your purpose - persuade, inform, or inspire?" and "Which structure matches that purpose?" This usually unsticks them.

**During Peer Review (15 minutes):** Emphasize this is about comparing strategic approaches, not error-finding. Vietnamese students may be hesitant to give critical feedback to peers - reframe as "helping your partner strengthen their work" and provide sentence starters. Listen for productive dialogue: students should be discussing WHY they made choices ("I chose Duarte structure because I'm persuading them to change behavior") not just describing WHAT they did. If you hear surface-level feedback like "looks good," intervene with deeper questions: "What makes the hook compelling? How could the CTA be more specific?" Watch for pairs who finish in 5-7 minutes (too superficial) - push them to dig deeper into one criterion rather than checking boxes quickly.

**During Revision & Debrief (15 minutes):** Give students full 10 minutes for revision - resist urge to start debrief early even if some finish quickly. This reflection time is where learning consolidates. During 5-minute debrief, draw out 2-3 different examples that made different strategic choices - celebrate the variety rather than looking for one "right" answer. Ask: "Who chose Duarte structure? Why? Who chose rule of three? Why?" Highlight how purpose drove structure choice. Address the most common struggle you observed during the activity (likely: making hooks specific enough, or making CTAs concrete rather than vague). Connect explicitly to their Group Presentation: "You'll use this exact process to storyboard your team presentation - storyboard first, THEN divide slide creation."

**Timing Flexibility:**

The 55-minute main activity is intentionally structured with some flexibility. If students are deeply engaged in peer review and producing high-quality feedback, let it run 18-20 minutes rather than cutting it at 15. Conversely, if quiz prep needs to be assigned as homework due to time constraints, that's acceptable - quiz questions are primarily for individual practice. What cannot be shortened: the 25-minute individual work (they need time to think and create) and 10-minute revision (consolidation phase). If running short on time, reduce debrief to 3 minutes of highlighting key patterns observed, then transition to quiz as homework: "Complete the 8 quiz questions tonight and we'll review answers at the start of next class."
