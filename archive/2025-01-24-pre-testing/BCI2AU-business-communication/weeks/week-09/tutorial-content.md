**Course**: Business Communication (BCI2AU)
**Week**: 9 of 11
**Tutorial Focus**: Designing Presentation Storyboards Using Evidence-Based Frameworks
**Duration**: 90 minutes

---

## LEARNING GOALS

## OPENING: REVIEW & ASSESSMENT CONNECTION (10 minutes)

### Quick Concept Review

**Three key principles from today's lecture:**

1. **Substance over style** — Quality of idea + narrative + passion (Anderson, 2013)
   - Choose primary purpose: persuade, inform, or inspire
   - Use Duarte's "what is/what could be" structure or rule of three

2. **Design for cognition** — Avoid cognitive overload (Krammer et al., 2021)
   - ≤6 elements per slide
   - One idea per slide, one minute per slide
   - Graphics over text

3. **Hook and land** — Strong openings and closings matter most
   - Hook: question, stat, story, statement, or visual
   - CTA: synthesize → inspire → direct

### Connection to Your Group Presentation

**Week 11 Group Presentation (30% + 15% individual grade):**

Your team will deliver a 15-minute presentation + 10-minute Q&A. Today's activity directly prepares you for these rubric criteria:

**Simplified Rubric Focus for Today:**

✓ **Organization & Structure** — Apply storytelling frameworks (Duarte, rule of three, hooks, CTAs)
✓ **Visual Aids** — Design slides following cognitive load principles (10 simple rules)
✓ **Content Quality** — Develop compelling message with clear strategic thinking

**For complete rubric and all performance levels, see syllabus pages 9-11.**

**Note:** We're practicing the DESIGN phase today. Next week (Week 10), we'll practice DELIVERY techniques (vocal variety, body language, handling Q&A).

## MAIN ACTIVITY: CREATE A PRESENTATION STORYBOARD (55 minutes)

### The Scenario

You are preparing a 5-minute presentation on a business communication topic for a professional development workshop at a Vietnamese technology company (similar to VNG or FPT). Your audience consists of 20-30 junior employees (ages 23-28) who want practical skills they can use immediately.

**Your task:** Create a complete presentation storyboard (not actual slides - just the structural blueprint) following the frameworks from today's lecture.

**Note:** There are multiple valid approaches to this task. Your strategic choices and reasoning matter more than following a single "correct" template.

---

### Choose Your Topic (Pick ONE)

Select one communication topic that interests you:

1. **Email Etiquette for Remote Teams** — How to write effective emails in virtual work environments
2. **Giving Constructive Feedback** — How to deliver feedback that improves performance without damaging relationships
3. **Managing Difficult Conversations** — How to navigate disagreements professionally
4. **Personal Branding on LinkedIn** — How to build professional credibility through social media
5. **Cross-Cultural Communication** — How to communicate effectively across Vietnamese and Western business cultures
6. **Presentation Anxiety Management** — How to manage nervousness and deliver confidently
7. **Data Storytelling Basics** — How to present numbers in compelling ways
8. **Meeting Facilitation Skills** — How to run productive meetings that don't waste time

### Storyboard Template

Use this structure to plan your 5-minute presentation (~5-6 slides at one-minute-per-slide pace):

---

**PRESENTATION STORYBOARD**

**Topic:** [Your chosen topic]

**Primary Purpose:** □ Persuade  □ Inform  □ Inspire  [Check ONE]

**Target Audience:** Vietnamese tech company junior employees (ages 23-28)

---

**OPENING (1 minute, Slide 1):**

**Hook Technique:** [Choose: Provocative Question | Surprising Statistic | Story | Bold Statement | Visual]

**Hook Content:** [Write your actual opening hook - what will you say/show in first 30 seconds?]

**Preview:** [Brief statement of what presentation will cover - "Today I'll share X framework/principles"]

---

**BODY (3 minutes, Slides 2-4):**

**Storytelling Structure:** [Choose: Duarte "What is/What could be" OR Rule of Three Sections]

**Slide 2:**
- **Content:** [What is this slide about? One idea only]
- **Key Visual:** [What image/graphic would support this? Graphics over text]
- **Text on Slide:** [Keep to ≤6 elements, short phrases only - what would actually appear on slide?]

**Slide 3:**
- **Content:** [What is this slide about? One idea only]
- **Key Visual:** [What image/graphic would support this?]
- **Text on Slide:** [≤6 elements, short phrases]

**Slide 4:**
- **Content:** [What is this slide about? One idea only]
- **Key Visual:** [What image/graphic would support this?]
- **Text on Slide:** [≤6 elements, short phrases]

**Optional Slide 5 (if needed):**
- **Content:**
- **Key Visual:**
- **Text on Slide:**

---

**CLOSING (1 minute, Final Slide):**

**Part 1 - Synthesize (20 seconds):** [Reinforce 2-3 key takeaways using rule of three]

**Part 2 - Inspire (20 seconds):** [Paint "new bliss" vision - how will their work life improve if they apply this?]

**Part 3 - Direct CTA (20 seconds):** [Specific, achievable action they should take this week]

---

**DESIGN CHECKLIST (review against 10 Simple Rules):**

- [ ] One idea per slide
- [ ] One minute per slide (5 min = 5-6 slides)
- [ ] Meaningful headlines (not generic like "Benefits")
- [ ] Essential points only (no distracting elements)
- [ ] Graphics over text where possible
- [ ] ≤6 elements per slide
- [ ] Strong opening hook
- [ ] Specific closing CTA

---

### Individual Work (25 minutes)

**Deliverable:** Complete storyboard using template above

**Considerations:**
- **Purpose choice matters**: Persuasive topics need Duarte structure (problem→solution alternation); informative topics can use rule of three
- **Vietnamese context**: Consider what resonates with Vietnamese junior employees - examples, cultural norms, local business practices
- **Cognitive load**: When planning "Text on Slide," keep it minimal - you'll SAY more than what appears on screen
- **Hook selection**: Choose hook technique that matches your topic and audience

**Tips:**
- Spend 5 minutes choosing topic and defining purpose
- Spend 10 minutes on body structure (slides 2-4)
- Spend 5 minutes each on opening hook and closing CTA
- Use lecture examples as inspiration, but make it your own

---

### Peer Review (15 minutes)

**Exchange storyboards with a partner (different topic preferred).**

**Review using these criteria:**

**Organization & Structure:**
- [ ] Clear purpose (persuade, inform, or inspire)?
- [ ] Appropriate storytelling structure chosen (Duarte vs. rule of three)?
- [ ] Logical flow from opening → body → closing?
- [ ] Rule of three applied (3 sections, 3 takeaways, etc.)?

**Slide Design Principles:**
- [ ] One idea per slide?
- [ ] ≤6 elements per slide?
- [ ] Graphics identified for visual support?
- [ ] Meaningful headlines (not generic)?

**Opening & Closing:**
- [ ] Hook creates tension/curiosity (not boring)?
- [ ] CTA is specific and achievable (not vague)?
- [ ] CTA appropriate for the purpose?

**Provide feedback:**

**One specific strength:** "Your hook [describe specific element] immediately grabbed my attention because..."

**One area to strengthen:** "Your CTA could be more specific by..."

**One question:** "I'm curious why you chose [X structure/approach] - how does that serve your purpose?"

**Remember:** We're comparing different strategic approaches, not finding errors. Your partner may have made different but equally valid choices.

---

### Revision & Debrief (15 minutes)

**Revision (10 minutes):**

Based on peer feedback, strengthen your storyboard. Focus on:
- Making your hook more compelling
- Ensuring each slide has ONE clear idea
- Making your CTA specific and achievable
- Confirming your structure matches your purpose

**Note:** You don't need to change your overall approach - focus on strengthening the reasoning and execution within your chosen strategy.

**Debrief Discussion (5 minutes):**

We'll discuss as a class:
- Which hook techniques were most popular? Why?
- How did purpose (persuade vs. inform vs. inspire) influence structure choices?
- What challenges did you face applying cognitive load principles?
- How will you use storyboarding for your Group Presentation?

## WRAP-UP: SELF-ASSESSMENT & NEXT STEPS (5 minutes)

### Self-Assessment

**Reflect on today's tutorial:**

1. **Structure confidence:** On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you in choosing and applying storytelling structures (Duarte vs. rule of three) for different presentation purposes?

2. **Design principles:** Which of the 10 Simple Rules feels most challenging to apply? (One idea per slide? Graphics over text? Cognitive load management?)

3. **Hook & CTA skills:** Do you feel prepared to craft compelling openings and closings for your Group Presentation?

### Next Steps for Your Group Presentation

**Before Week 10:**
1. **Meet with your group** — Discuss presentation topic and create initial storyboard together
2. **Define purpose** — Decide if your presentation primarily persuades, informs, or inspires
3. **Assign roles** — Who will create which slides based on storyboard sections?

**Week 10 Class:**
- **Topic:** Presentations Part II - Delivery & Executive Presence (vocal variety, body language, Q&A strategies)
- **Due:** Your Group Presentation slides (upload to Moodle)
- **Quiz 3:** Covers Weeks 7-9 (data storytelling, business reports, presentations design)

**Week 11:**
- **Group Presentations** — 15 minutes + 10 minutes Q&A

### Final Reminders

- **Storyboard first, slides second** — Don't let your group skip this planning step
- **Apply today's principles** — Duarte structure, cognitive load rules, hooks, CTAs
- **Practice early** — Rule #9 (iterative practice) requires multiple rehearsals

**Your Group Presentation is worth 45% of your final grade (30% group + 15% individual). Invest time in excellent design and delivery.**
