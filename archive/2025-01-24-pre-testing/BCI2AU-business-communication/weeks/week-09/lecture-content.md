Week 9: Presentations Part I - Design & Structure

Andrews University - National Economics University Campus
Fall 2025

Instructor: William Winterton Lang

[PURPOSE: Orient]
[TIMING: 1 minute]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome to Week 9 where we shift from written to oral communication
- Two-week presentation sequence: this week = design/structure, next week = delivery/presence

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Today's focus: crafting the presentation itself (content, story, slides)
- Next week: delivering it effectively (voice, body language, handling Q&A)
- Both are essential for your Group Presentation in Week 11
- Vietnamese context: Many students feel nervous about presentations - we'll build confidence systematically

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with a question that may resonate with many of you..."

---

**SLIDE 2: Opening Question**

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

"Have you ever sat through a presentation where the speaker read every word on their slides, and you found yourself checking your phone instead of listening?"

— Common experience we'll learn to avoid today

[PURPOSE: Hook]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Show of hands: "How many have experienced this?" [Most hands will go up]
- Validate: "You're not alone - this is called 'Death by PowerPoint'"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Today we'll learn WHY this happens (cognitive science)
- More importantly, HOW to avoid it in your presentations
- Your Group Presentation is Week 11 - these principles apply directly

**Examples/Stories:**
- Share brief story: "I once attended a conference where the speaker had 60 slides for 30 minutes, each with 200 words. After 5 minutes, the entire audience was on their laptops doing email."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What makes a presentation boring or ineffective?" [Take 2-3 responses: too much text, monotone reading, no visuals, unclear message]

**Transition:**
- "Before we fix the problem, let's make sure we understand key presentation terms..."

---

**SLIDE 3: Key Vocabulary**

<!-- LAYOUT: vocab-table-slide -->

**CONTENT**:

| **English Term** | **Vietnamese Translation** | **Definition** |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Storytelling structure** | Cấu trúc kể chuyện | Organizing presentation as a narrative arc with beginning, middle, end |
| **Cognitive load** | Tải nhận thức | Mental effort required to process information |
| **Hook** | Mở đầu thu hút | Opening element that captures audience attention |
| **Call-to-action (CTA)** | Lời kêu gọi hành động | Specific request for what audience should do next |
| **Narrative arc** | Cung chuyện | The emotional journey of a presentation from beginning to resolution |
| **Visual hierarchy** | Thứ bậc hình ảnh | Arrangement of elements to show importance and guide attention |
| **Death by PowerPoint** | Thuyết trình nhàm chán | Ineffective presentations with text-heavy slides read verbatim |

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Introduce vocabulary to build confidence for English-language business presentations
- These terms are used globally in professional settings

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Storytelling structure**: Not just facts - presentations need narrative flow like a good story
- **Cognitive load**: Key concept for today - our brains have limited processing capacity
- **Hook & CTA**: Bookends of your presentation - grab attention early, direct action at end
- **Death by PowerPoint**: We'll learn the science behind why this fails

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnamese context: "When FPT Techday 2024 presented their AI strategy, they used storytelling structure - starting with customer problem, building to solution"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can someone use 'cognitive load' in a sentence related to presentations?" [Expected: "Reading slides while listening creates too much cognitive load"]

**Transition:**
- "Now that we have our vocabulary, let's establish what we're trying to achieve today..."

---

**SLIDE 4: Learning Objectives**

<!-- LAYOUT: objectives-slide -->

**CONTENT**:

By the end of today's session, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Nancy Duarte's "What is/What could be" storytelling structure to organize persuasive presentations
2. **Design** slides that minimize cognitive load using evidence-based principles
3. **Construct** effective opening hooks and closing calls-to-action
4. **Analyze** the differences between presentations that persuade, inform, and inspire
5. **Evaluate** presentation designs using the "rule of three" and other structural frameworks

[PURPOSE: Orient]
[TIMING: 2 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- These objectives directly prepare you for Week 11 Group Presentations
- Notice the action verbs: apply, design, construct, analyze, evaluate (Bloom's taxonomy)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Objective 1 (Duarte framework): Core storytelling structure used by TED speakers
- Objective 2 (cognitive load): Science-based slide design to keep audience engaged
- Objectives 3-5: Practical skills you'll practice in tutorial today

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which objective feels most challenging to you?" [Show of hands for each - helps gauge anxiety levels]

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect these skills to your upcoming assessment..."

---

**SLIDE 5: Connection to Your Group Presentation**

**CONTENT**:

**Your Week 11 Group Presentation (30% + 15% individual):**

Your team will deliver a **15-minute presentation + 10-minute Q&A** on a business communication topic.

**Today's skills directly address the rubric:**

✓ **Content Quality** → Storytelling structure ensures compelling message
✓ **Organization & Structure** → Duarte's framework, rule of three, opening hooks, CTAs
✓ **Visual Aids** → Slide design principles from research
✓ **Time Management** → "One minute per slide" rule helps planning

**In tutorial today:** You'll practice designing a presentation storyboard using these frameworks.

[PURPOSE: Persuade]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Make explicit connection: "Everything today = direct practice for your graded presentation"
- Show syllabus Group Presentation rubric criteria (pull up PDF if possible)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Content quality**: Great content poorly structured = ineffective
- **Organization**: Rubric specifically mentions "storytelling frameworks from course"
- **Visual aids**: "Avoids 'death by PowerPoint'" is literally in rubric
- **Time management**: 15 minutes requires ~15 slides

**Examples/Stories:**
- Past example: "Last year, a group had brilliant research but 40 text-heavy slides. They rushed, audience was confused, lost 15 points on Organization & Visual Aids."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How many slides should you aim for in a 15-minute presentation?" [Answer: ~15, using one-minute-per-slide rule]

**Transition:**
- "Now let's dive into the substance - what makes presentations rise or fall..."

**SLIDE 6: Part 1: Presentation Fundamentals**

**The Foundation of Killer Presentations**

[PURPOSE: Transition]
[TIMING: 0.5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Clear transition to main content
- This section covers foundational principles before specific techniques

**Transition:**
- "Chris Anderson, curator of TED Talks - which have been viewed over 1 billion times - distilled what makes presentations work..."

---

**SLIDE 7: The Core Principle of Great Presentations**

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

"Presentations rise or fall on the quality of the idea, the narrative, and the passion of the speaker. It's about substance, not style."

— Chris Anderson, TED Curator (2013)

[PURPOSE: Inspire]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Read quote slowly and deliberately
- Let it sink in: "Read that again silently to yourself" [pause 5 seconds]

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Substance over style**: No amount of fancy slides can compensate for weak ideas
- **Quality of idea**: Must have something worth saying - research, insight, solution
- **Narrative**: How you structure and tell the story (today's focus)
- **Passion**: Genuine enthusiasm - can't be faked (next week's focus)

**Examples/Stories:**
- TED context: Anderson has coached thousands of speakers, identified these three as non-negotiable
- Vietnamese context: "When Tran Dang Hoa (FPT Chairman) presented on AI talent development at Vietnam Innovation Day 2024, his passion for the topic was evident - that's what made the presentation memorable, not the slides"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- Students think: "If I make beautiful slides, my presentation will be good"
- Reality: "Beautiful slides + weak idea = still a bad presentation"
- Slides should SUPPORT your idea, not replace it

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between substance and style in presentations?" [Substance = idea/content, Style = delivery/design]

**Transition:**
- "So if substance is most important, what exactly is the substance? Three types of presentations serve different purposes..."

---

**SLIDE 8: Three Types of Presentations**

**CONTENT**:

Presentations can **persuade**, **inform**, or **inspire**. Understanding your primary purpose shapes structure and content.

| **Purpose** | **Goal** | **Structure** | **Example Context** |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Persuade** | Change minds, drive action, overcome objections | Problem → Solution → Benefit; What is → What could be | Sales pitch, proposal, recommendation |
| **Inform** | Transfer knowledge, explain concepts, share data | Logical sequence, topic breakdown, Q&A | Training, report presentation, update |
| **Inspire** | Motivate, energize, create emotional connection | Story arc, vision, call-to-action | Keynote, vision statement, commencement |

**Most business presentations blend all three, but one is primary.**

<!-- LAYOUT: comparison-table -->

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Draw on board: "Persuade | Inform | Inspire" as three columns
- Ask class: "What's your Group Presentation's primary purpose?" [Most will say "inform" - challenge them to consider persuasion]

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Persuade**: You want audience to DO something or believe something different after
- **Inform**: You want audience to KNOW something they didn't know before
- **Inspire**: You want audience to FEEL something - motivation, hope, urgency
- **Blended**: Example - Steve Jobs' iPhone launch (2007): Informed about features, Persuaded to buy, Inspired about future

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnamese context: "VNG Corporation's investor presentations = primarily persuade (buy stock), secondarily inform (company performance)"
- Student context: "Your group presentation may feel like 'inform' but you're also persuading us you understand the topic deeply and can apply it"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Academic presentations only inform" → False, you're also persuading professor you've learned
- "I can't inspire in a business presentation" → False, closing with inspiring vision is powerful

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If I'm presenting a crisis communication plan to my CEO, what's my primary purpose?" [Answer: Persuade - convince them to approve the plan]
- "If I'm training new employees on email etiquette, what's my primary purpose?" [Answer: Inform, with some persuasion on why it matters]

**Transition:**
- "Now that we know WHAT we're trying to achieve, let's learn HOW to structure presentations that persuade..."

**SLIDE 9: Part 2: Storytelling Structures**

**From What Is to What Could Be**

[PURPOSE: Transition]
[TIMING: 0.5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Transition:**
- "We're moving from theory to practical frameworks you'll use to structure your presentations"

---

**SLIDE 10: Nancy Duarte's Storytelling Framework**

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**The "What is/What could be" Structure**

**Beginning:** Describe current reality (What is) → Reveal better future (What could be)
*Creates tension by contrasting present with possibility*

**Middle:** Alternate between "What is" and "What could be"
*Each cycle makes the future state more compelling*

**End:** Describe "new bliss" - the transformed world
*Call-to-action with concrete next steps*

*Duarte, N. (2012). Structure your presentation like a story. Harvard Business Review. https://hbr.org/2012/10/structure-your-presentation-li*

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Draw on board: "What is ↔ What could be ↔ What is ↔ What could be → New Bliss"
- Introduce Duarte: "Communication expert who analyzed great speeches - Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **The contrast creates persuasion**: By showing gap between reality and possibility, you create tension that needs resolution
- **Beginning**: Establish rapport by describing their world accurately ("People should be nodding their heads")
- **Middle**: Each alternation builds desire for the "what could be"
- **End**: Don't just list tasks - paint picture of transformed world

**Examples/Stories:**
- Real example: "Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech used this structure perfectly"
  - What is: Segregation, inequality, injustice
  - What could be: Children of different races playing together, judged by character not color
  - Alternated throughout, built to climactic vision of "new bliss"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why does alternating between 'what is' and 'what could be' work better than just describing the future once?" [Answer: Repetition builds desire, contrast creates tension, audience gets increasingly attracted to "what could be"]

**Transition:**
- "Let me show you how this works in a business context with a real example..."

---

**SLIDE 11: Duarte Framework in Action: FPT Example**

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

**Vietnamese Context: Duarte's Structure**

**Hypothetical FPT Techday 2024 AI Presentation Structure:**

**What is:** "Vietnamese companies struggle to find AI talent - 80% of positions unfilled for 6+ months"

**What could be:** "Imagine graduating students who are job-ready with AI skills from Day 1"

**What is:** "Current training doesn't match industry needs - students learn theory without practical application"

**What could be:** "Our AI bootcamp combines hands-on projects with real client problems"

**New Bliss (Closing):** "One year from now, Vietnam could be Southeast Asia's AI talent hub, with your graduates leading the transformation"

**Call-to-action:** "Partner with us to design the curriculum your industry needs"

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Connect to Vietnamese context: "FPT is one of Vietnam's largest tech companies - they present frequently to investors, partners, government"
- Note: "This is a hypothetical structure based on FPT's actual AI initiatives in 2024"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **What is (Problem 1)**: Start with painful current reality - talent shortage
- **What could be (Solution 1)**: Show possibility - job-ready graduates
- **What is (Problem 2)**: Deepen the pain - training gap
- **What could be (Solution 2)**: Show how to bridge gap
- **New Bliss**: Paint the aspirational future state (Vietnam as AI hub)
- **CTA**: Specific action request (partner with us)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Real data: Vietnam tech sector is growing 15-20% annually, talent shortage is real challenge
- FPT actually did host Techday 2024 with AI focus and 20+ presentations

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I need to present ALL problems before ANY solutions" → No, alternate for persuasive rhythm
- "New bliss sounds too idealistic for business" → Actually, aspirational vision is powerful in business

**Check for Understanding:**
- "In your Group Presentation, what might be your 'what is' vs 'what could be'?" [Take 1-2 examples from class]

**Transition:**
- "Duarte's framework is one powerful structure. Let me show you Chris Anderson's five pillars that work with any structure..."

---

**SLIDE 12: Anderson's Five Pillars Framework**

**CONTENT**:

Chris Anderson, TED Curator, identifies five essential elements for great presentations (Anderson, 2013):

1. **Frame Your Story** — Determine where to begin and conclude; position as a journey
2. **Plan Your Delivery** — Choose: memorize, use bullets, or script (but never read)
3. **Develop Stage Presence** — Focus on authenticity over perfection
4. **Plan Multimedia** — Use visuals strategically; avoid reading slides
5. **Put It Together** — Rehearse extensively; stay authentic

**Key insight:** Go deep, not broad. Avoid covering too much ground; use specific examples instead.

*Anderson, C. (2013). How to give a killer presentation. Harvard Business Review, 91(6), 121-125. https://hbr.org/2013/06/how-to-give-a-killer-presentation*

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 4 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Remind: "TED Talks = over 1 billion views, Anderson coached these speakers"
- Context: "These five pillars apply whether you use Duarte's structure or any other framework"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Frame your story (#1)**: Most important - determines success or failure
- **Plan delivery (#2)**: Three options, but NEVER read from slides or script verbatim
- **Stage presence (#3)**: Authenticity beats polish (we'll practice next week)
- **Multimedia (#4)**: Slides should enhance, not replace your message
- **Rehearsal (#5)**: Non-negotiable for important presentations

**Examples/Stories:**
- TED example: "Many successful TED speakers use no slides at all - the story is enough"
- Vietnamese context: "In Vietnamese business culture, reading from slides is seen as unprepared - audience expects you to KNOW your content"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I should memorize every word" → Only for very important talks; usually bullet points work better
- "Perfect delivery matters most" → Substance + authenticity matter more than perfection

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why does Anderson say 'go deep, not broad'?" [Answer: Better to cover one topic thoroughly with examples than skim five topics superficially]
- "What's wrong with reading from your slides?" [Audiences detect distance, lose engagement, create cognitive overload]

**Transition:**
- "Both Duarte and Anderson emphasize STORY. Let's explore one more powerful technique - the rule of three..."

---

**SLIDE 13: The Rule of Three in Presentations**

**CONTENT**:

**The Rule of Three:** People understand and remember concepts better when presented in groups of three.

**Why it works:**
- **Cognitive processing:** Our brains expect patterns of three - easier to process and recall
- **Narrative satisfaction:** Beginning, middle, end feels complete
- **Persuasive rhythm:** One point = weak, two = incomplete, three = convincing, four+ = overwhelming

**Applications in presentations:**

**Structure:** Divide into three main sections
**Supporting points:** Three reasons, three benefits, three examples per claim
**Message hierarchy:** Three key takeaways in summary

**Example:** This course organizes learning objectives into three categories (Understand & Apply, Analyze & Evaluate, Create & Present)

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Quick activity: "I'm going to say a list. Notice what feels complete: Red, blue. Red, blue, green. Red, blue, green, yellow." [Most will say three feels right]

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Not arbitrary**: Based on cognitive science - working memory comfortably holds ~3 chunks
- **Classic examples**: "Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness" (US); "Liberty, equality, fraternity" (France); "Blood, sweat, and tears" (Churchill)
- **Business applications**: "People, process, technology" common in consulting frameworks

**Examples/Stories:**
- Vietnamese context: "FPT's 2024 focus areas: AI, semiconductors, green transformation - three pillars"
- Student application: "Your Group Presentation should have ~3 main sections for 15 minutes"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I have five important points - I must include all" → Choose the three most important; cut or combine the rest
- "Three is just a superstition" → No, it's cognitive science (cite working memory research)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What are three ways you could apply the rule of three in your presentation?" [Answers: 3 sections, 3 examples per point, 3 takeaways, etc.]

**Transition:**
- "We've covered storytelling structures. Now let's tackle the other half of effective presentations - slide design..."

## Speaker Notes

**Transition:**
- "Remember our opening question about boring presentations? Now we'll learn the science behind why they fail - and how to design slides that work WITH your audience's brain, not against it."

**SLIDE 15: The Problem: Cognitive Overload**

<!-- LAYOUT: big-number-slide -->

**500%**

Increase in cognitive load when processing more than 6 elements simultaneously

*Krammer, G., et al. (2021). Ten simple rules for effective presentation slides. PLOS Computational Biology, 17(12), e1009554. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009554*

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Write on board: "500%" in huge numbers
- Ask: "What do you think this number represents?" [Take guesses]

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Cognitive load**: Mental effort required to process information
- **The magic number 6**: Brain easily interprets ≤6 elements; 7+ requires 500% more effort
- **Why "Death by PowerPoint" happens**: Slides with 10 bullet points, each with 20 words = massive cognitive overload
- **The conflict**: Reading and listening use the SAME cognitive resources (language processing)

**Examples/Stories:**
- Demonstrate: Show example slide with 50 words and try to talk while students read - they'll miss what you say
- Research context: PLOS Computational Biology published "Ten Simple Rules" in 2021 based on cognitive science

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "More information on slide = better" → False, causes overload
- "I can multitask reading and listening" → False for most people - they compete for same brain resources

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why can't your brain read a slide AND listen to the speaker simultaneously?" [Answer: Both require language processing - same cognitive channel]
- "How many main elements should each slide have?" [Answer: ≤6 for easy processing]

**Transition:**
- "Now that we know the problem - cognitive overload - let's look at ten research-backed solutions..."

---

**SLIDE 16: Ten Simple Rules for Slide Design (Part 1)**

**Rules 1-5: Optimizing Slide Scope**

1. **One idea per slide** — Break complex concepts into progressive reveals
2. **One minute per slide** — 20-minute talk = ~20 slides for good pacing
3. **Meaningful headlines** — Transform "Results" into "CTNND1 is central to metastasis"
4. **Essential points only** — Include only content you'll discuss; remove distractions
5. **Proper attribution** — Always cite sources, names, credits consistently

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Context: "Published in peer-reviewed journal, based on cognitive science and teaching research"
- Relevance: "These rules directly improve your Group Presentation slides"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Rule 1 (One idea)**: If explaining complex framework, show it piece by piece across 2-3 slides, not all at once
- **Rule 2 (One minute)**: Easy math - 15-minute presentation = ~15 slides
- **Rule 3 (Headlines)**: Your slide title should be the conclusion, not generic label
- **Rule 4 (Essential only)**: Delete anything you won't actually explain
- **Rule 5 (Attribution)**: Builds credibility, required for academic integrity

**Examples/Stories:**
- **Rule 1 violation**: "I once saw a slide with a 12-step process diagram - impossible to absorb"
- **Rule 3 example**: Instead of "Data Analysis," use "Sales increased 40% after campaign"
- Vietnamese context: "FPT presentations use meaningful headlines - not 'Q4 Results' but 'Record Revenue Growth in AI Division'"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I should put everything I want to say on slides so I don't forget" → Use speaker notes instead
- "If I only put key points, slides will look empty" → Minimalism is professional and effective

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How many slides should your 15-minute Group Presentation have?" [Answer: ~15, using one-minute rule]
- "What's better: slide titled 'Benefits' or 'Three Ways This Saves Time'?" [Answer: Second - meaningful headline]

**Transition:**
- "Rules 1-5 were about WHAT to put on slides. Rules 6-8 are about HOW to design them..."

---

**SLIDE 17: Ten Simple Rules for Slide Design (Part 2)**

**Rules 6-8: Design Elements**

6. **Graphics over text** — Presentations are visual; prioritize images over words
7. **Avoid cognitive overload** — Use short text fragments redundant with verbal; reading + listening compete
8. **Distraction-resistant design** — Ask: "If they heard nothing, would they understand the key concept?"

**Design specifics (Rule 7):**
- High-contrast colors, simple backgrounds
- Sans serif fonts, large sizes (avoid italics, ALL CAPS)
- Color-blind accessible palettes
- ≤6 elements per slide

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Remind about cognitive overload: "Reading and listening compete - same brain channel"
- Show example: Display slide with just image + 3-word caption while talking - much easier to process

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Rule 6 (Graphics)**: One powerful image > 100 words; but don't overcrowd
- **Rule 7 (Avoid overload)**: Key phrase "short text fragments, redundant with verbal" - repeat what you say, don't add new info
- **Rule 8 (Distraction-resistant)**: Main message should be clear even without narration
- **Font choice**: Sans serif (Arial, Helvetica, Calibri) more readable than serif (Times New Roman) on screens

**Examples/Stories:**
- **Rule 6 example**: Instead of bulleted list of "Characteristics of good leaders," show photo of respected leader with 3-word caption "Integrity, Vision, Empathy"
- **Rule 7 violation**: Slide says "Market share increased 32%" while you say "Revenue grew 45%" - audience confused
- Vietnamese context: "Many Vietnamese presentations use decorative backgrounds - research says simple is better"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I need full sentences on slides as backup" → Use handouts or speaker notes for details
- "Fancy fonts look more professional" → Simple sans serif fonts are most professional for presentations

**Check for Understanding:**
- "True or False: You should put additional information on slides that you don't say out loud" [Answer: False - creates cognitive overload]
- "Which is better for presentation slides: Times New Roman or Arial?" [Answer: Arial (sans serif)]

**Transition:**
- "Rules 9-10 are about preparing to deliver your carefully designed presentation..."

---

**SLIDE 18: Ten Simple Rules for Slide Design (Part 3)**

**Rules 9-10: Presentation Preparation**

9. **Iterative practice** — Rehearse with live audiences; reveals timing issues, weak transitions
10. **Technical disaster mitigation** — Save as PDF backup; avoid animations; screenshot videos

**Why practice matters:**
- Reveals which slides take longer than expected
- Identifies confusing transitions
- Exposes Rule 2, 4, 5 violations (too many/too few slides, extra content, missing credits)

**Why avoid animations:**
- "No one likes them" (research surveys)
- Create accessibility issues for visually impaired
- Introduce software compatibility risks
- Add no real value

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Emphasize: "Rules 1-8 won't matter if you don't practice (#9) or your tech fails (#10)"
- Connect to their assessment: "Your Group Presentation requires rehearsal time - plan for it"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Rule 9 (Practice)**: Practice alone first, then with friend/classmate - fresh eyes catch issues
- **Rule 10 (Tech backup)**: Murphy's Law in action - if it can fail, it will (especially fonts, videos)
- **Animation advice**: Controversial but research-backed - avoid fancy transitions
- **PDF backup**: Ensures fonts, layout preserved across computers

**Examples/Stories:**
- **Practice story**: "Group last semester practiced once the night before - discovered they were 8 minutes over time limit, had to cut frantically"
- **Tech failure story**: "Student's embedded video wouldn't play on classroom computer - 5 minutes wasted troubleshooting"
- Vietnamese context: "In professional settings in Vietnam, technical issues reflect poorly on preparation - always have backup"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Animations make presentations more engaging" → Research shows audiences dislike them
- "One practice run is enough" → Multiple rehearsals reveal different issues each time

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why should you save presentation as PDF backup?" [Answer: Ensures compatibility, preserves fonts/layout]
- "When should you practice your presentation?" [Answer: Multiple times, ideally with audience, well before delivery date]

**Transition:**
- "We've covered what makes slides effective. Now let's talk about how to START and END your presentation powerfully..."

**The Critical First and Last Minutes**

[PURPOSE: Transition]
[TIMING: 0.5 minutes]

---

## Speaker Notes

**Transition:**
- "Research shows audiences decide within the first 30 seconds whether to pay attention. And they remember most what you say last. So openings and closings are critical."

---

**SLIDE 20: Opening Hooks: Five Proven Techniques**

**CONTENT**:

Your opening 30-60 seconds determines audience engagement for the entire presentation.

**Five effective hook techniques:**

1. **Provocative Question** — "What would you do if your company's data was breached right now?"
2. **Surprising Statistic** — "90% of online courses are never completed - here's why"
3. **Relevant Story** — Brief anecdote (30-45 seconds) that illustrates your topic
4. **Bold Statement** — "Everything you learned about email communication is wrong"
5. **Visual Hook** — Powerful image that creates curiosity without explanation (yet)

**What NOT to do:**
❌ "Today I'm going to talk about..." (boring)
❌ Long apologies or self-deprecation

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Remind: "Your opening hook is the first element of Duarte's structure - it establishes 'what is' and creates tension"
- Show examples from your own presentation: "Notice I started today with a question about boring presentations - that was a hook"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **30-second rule**: Research shows attention decisions made quickly
- **Hook = tension**: You're creating a gap (curiosity, concern, interest) that your presentation will resolve
- **Choose ONE technique**: Don't combine multiple hooks - pick your strongest
- **Avoid apologies**: "I'm not prepared" or "This might be boring" kills engagement immediately

**Examples/Stories:**
- **Provocative question**: Chris Anderson's TED talk on presentations opens with "What makes presentations effective?"
- **Surprising stat**: "Did you know 67% of employees say poor communication is their biggest workplace frustration?"
- **Story example**: "When Steve Jobs introduced iPhone, he started: 'Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything'"
- Vietnamese context: "In Vietnamese business culture, starting with too much self-deprecation can undermine credibility - balance humility with confidence"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I should introduce myself and my credentials first" → Brief intro OK, but hook comes first
- "Story hooks should be long and detailed" → 30-45 seconds maximum, just enough to create interest

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which hook technique would work best for a presentation on crisis communication?" [Answers could vary: provocative question "What would you do if...?", story about real crisis, surprising stat about crisis failures]
- "Why should you avoid starting with 'Today I'm going to talk about...'?" [Answer: Boring, no tension, audience knows you're talking to them already]

**Transition:**
- "You've hooked them at the start. Now you need to land the ending with a strong call-to-action..."

**SLIDE 21: Closing Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**

**CONTENT**:

Your closing should inspire action, not just summarize. **Strong CTAs are specific, achievable, and aligned with your presentation's purpose.**

**Three-part closing structure:**

1. **Synthesize (30 seconds)** — Briefly reinforce 2-3 key takeaways (rule of three)
2. **Inspire (30 seconds)** — Paint "new bliss" vision (Duarte) of transformed future
3. **Direct (30 seconds)** — Specific call-to-action with concrete next steps

**Examples of specific CTAs:**

✓ **Persuasive:** "Schedule a meeting with your team this week to discuss implementation"
✓ **Informative:** "Review the handout and try technique #2 in your next email"
✓ **Inspirational:** "Commit to one small change today - message me what you choose"

**Weak CTAs to avoid:**
❌ "So that's everything - any questions?"
❌ "Thank you for listening" [ends abruptly]
❌ "Let me know if you want to learn more"

[PURPOSE: Inform]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Remind: "Audiences remember beginnings and endings most - make them count"
- Connect to Duarte: "The CTA is where you deliver the 'new bliss' and tell them how to get there"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Three-part structure**: Synthesize → Inspire → Direct (another rule of three)
- **Specific, not vague**: "Email me your questions" is better than "Let me know if interested"
- **Achievable action**: Don't ask for huge commitment; one small step is better
- **Align with purpose**: Persuasive presentations need stronger, more direct CTAs

**Examples/Stories:**
- **Strong CTA example**: "Your Group Presentation CTA might be: 'Before next class, identify one communication habit you'll change based on what we shared today'"
- **Weak CTA story**: "Student presentation ended with 'Thanks for listening' - no clear takeaway, audience forgot content within 5 minutes"
- Vietnamese context: "In Vietnamese culture, being too direct can seem pushy - frame CTAs as invitations: 'I invite you to try...' vs. 'You must...'"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Questions should come after my last point" → No, deliver CTA first, THEN invite questions
- "Thank you for listening is a good closing" → It's polite but weak - use it AFTER your CTA
- "My CTA should be big and ambitious" → Small, specific actions have higher compliance

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What are the three parts of a strong closing?" [Answer: Synthesize, Inspire, Direct]
- "Which CTA is better: 'Think about this topic' or 'Write down one insight from today'?" [Answer: Second - specific and achievable]

**Transition:**
- "Let's see all of these principles in action with a complete presentation storyboard example..."

## Speaker Notes

**Transition:**
- "We've covered storytelling structures, slide design rules, and opening/closing techniques. Now let's integrate everything into a practical example."

**SLIDE 23: Sample Storyboard: Crisis Communication Presentation**

<!-- LAYOUT: dark-bg -->

**Complete 10-Minute Presentation Structure**

**Opening (1 min):**
- **Hook:** "At 3 AM, your company's database is breached. What's your first move?"
- **Preview:** "Today: 3-step crisis communication framework you can use immediately"

**Body (7 min, ~7 slides using Duarte structure):**
- **Slide 1 - What is:** Most companies respond to crises reactively and slowly
- **Slide 2 - What could be:** Imagine having a pre-built response protocol ready to activate
- **Slide 3 - What is:** 48% of companies lose customer trust due to delayed crisis response (Argenti, 2002)
- **Slide 4 - What could be:** The First 24 Hours Framework - speed AND accuracy
- **Slides 5-7:** Three elements of framework (rule of three) with examples

**Closing (2 min):**
- **Synthesize:** "Speed, transparency, action - the three crisis essentials"
- **Inspire:** "Your next crisis doesn't have to be a disaster - it can be a trust-building moment"
- **CTA:** "This week, draft your crisis communication template using our framework"

**Total:** 10 slides for 10 minutes = one-minute-per-slide rule ✓

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Explain: "This is a storyboard - outline of presentation structure before creating actual slides"
- Purpose: "Creating storyboard first (like an architect's blueprint) ensures logical flow before design work"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Hook (provocative question)**: Creates immediate tension - "What would I do?"
- **Duarte structure**: Alternates "what is" (problem) with "what could be" (solution)
- **Rule of three**: Three crisis essentials, three framework elements
- **Slide design**: 10 slides in 10 minutes follows one-minute rule
- **CTA (specific)**: "Draft your template this week" - achievable action

**Examples/Stories:**
- Walk through each section: "Notice how slide 1 describes current painful reality (reactive, slow), then slide 2 immediately contrasts with better possibility (prepared protocol)"
- Research integration: "Argenti's 2002 HBR article provides the 48% statistic - builds credibility"
- Vietnamese context: "This structure would work for FPT presenting crisis protocols to clients"

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "I should create slides first, then figure out structure" → No, storyboard first
- "10 slides sounds too simple for 10 minutes" → Simplicity is strength; one idea per slide

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Where do you see Duarte's 'what is/what could be' structure in this storyboard?" [Slides 1-4 alternate]
- "Where's the rule of three?" [Three crisis essentials, three framework elements]
- "Is the CTA specific or vague?" [Specific - draft template this week]

**Transition:**
- "This storyboard integrates all of today's principles. In tutorial, you'll create your own storyboard for practice..."

**SLIDE 24: Creating Your Presentation Storyboard**

**CONTENT**:

**Storyboard = Blueprint for your presentation before designing slides**

**Five-step storyboard process:**

1. **Define purpose** — Persuade, inform, or inspire? (Choose primary)
2. **Choose structure** — Duarte "what is/what could be" OR Anderson's 5 pillars OR rule of three sections
3. **Craft opening hook** — Select technique (question, stat, story, statement, visual)
4. **Outline body** — List key points (≤6), assign ~1 minute per slide
5. **Design closing CTA** — Synthesize, inspire, direct (three parts)

**Tutorial preview:** You'll practice this process by creating a storyboard for a 5-minute presentation on a communication topic.

[PURPOSE: Inform]
[TIMING: 3 minutes]

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Emphasize practicality: "Storyboarding takes 20-30 minutes but saves hours of slide redesign later"
- Connect to assessment: "Your Group Presentation should start with storyboard - THEN divide slide creation among team members"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Step 1 (Purpose)**: Everything flows from this - persuade requires different structure than inform
- **Step 2 (Structure)**: Choose ONE framework - Duarte works well for persuasive, rule of three for informative
- **Step 3 (Hook)**: Spend time on this - weak opening dooms entire presentation
- **Step 4 (Body)**: One-minute-per-slide rule simplifies planning
- **Step 5 (CTA)**: Don't skip this - even informative presentations should have takeaway action

**Examples/Stories:**
- Process example: "I spent 30 minutes storyboarding this lecture - identified 25 slides needed, then created them in 2 hours"
- Student mistake: "Groups often skip storyboarding, each member creates slides independently, then discover overlap and gaps"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the first step in storyboarding?" [Answer: Define purpose - persuade, inform, or inspire]
- "Should you create slides or storyboard first?" [Answer: Storyboard first]

**Transition:**
- "Let's synthesize everything we've learned today..."

---

**SLIDE 25: Key Takeaways**

**CONTENT**:

**Three essential principles for effective presentations:**

1. **Substance over style** — Quality of idea + narrative + passion (Anderson, 2013)
   - Choose persuade, inform, or inspire as primary purpose
   - Structure with Duarte's "what is/what could be" or rule of three

2. **Design for cognition** — Avoid cognitive overload (Krammer et al., 2021)
   - ≤6 elements per slide
   - Graphics over text
   - One idea per slide, one minute per slide

3. **Hook and land** — Strong openings and closings are critical
   - Hook techniques: question, stat, story, statement, visual
   - CTA structure: synthesize → inspire → direct

**Your challenge:** Apply these frameworks in your Week 11 Group Presentation to demonstrate depth of understanding, strategic thinking, and professional communication skills.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Remind: "These aren't just theories - they're research-backed principles used by TED speakers, top executives, successful presenters worldwide"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- **Takeaway 1**: All the fancy slides in the world won't save a presentation with weak ideas
- **Takeaway 2**: Cognitive science explains why "Death by PowerPoint" fails - design WITH brain, not against it
- **Takeaway 3**: First impression (hook) and last impression (CTA) determine whether audience remembers and acts

**Examples/Stories:**
- Success story: "Group last semester used Duarte structure + cognitive load principles - scored 92% on presentation"
- Failure story: "Another group had great content but 50-word slides and weak opening - scored 76%"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "If you remember only ONE thing from today, what should it be?" [Take responses - validate various answers]

**Transition:**
- "In tutorial today, you'll practice creating a presentation storyboard. Next week, we'll focus on delivery techniques to bring your well-designed presentation to life. Let's preview what's coming..."
