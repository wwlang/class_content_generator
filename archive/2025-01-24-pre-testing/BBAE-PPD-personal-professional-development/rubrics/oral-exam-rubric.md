## Time Management Guide

**Suggested 10-Minute Structure:**

| Time | Section | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0:00-1:00 | Opening | Hook + introduce yourself + preview |
| 1:00-3:00 | Self-Discovery Journey | Key insights from assessments, values, strengths |
| 3:00-5:00 | Career Vision & Goals | Your 1-3-5 year plan, why these goals |
| 5:00-7:00 | Learning Integration | Mentorship impact, course insights, growth |
| 7:00-9:00 | Strategies & Commitment | How you'll achieve goals, your commitment |
| 9:00-10:00 | Closing | Synthesis, memorable closing thought |

**Practice tip:** If you go over 10:30 in practice, you WILL go over in the actual presentation due to nerves. Cut content until you're at 9:30-10:00 in practice.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Reading slides word-for-word** - Slides should support, not be your script
2. **Too much content** - Better to go deep on fewer points than rush through many
3. **No personal story** - This is about YOUR journey, make it personal
4. **Generic goals** - "Get a good job" is not compelling; be specific
5. **Ignoring the audience** - Make eye contact, engage, read the room
6. **No energy** - This is your future! Show some passion
7. **Unprepared for questions** - Think ahead about what might be asked
8. **Going way over/under time** - Practice timing!

## What Makes an Excellent Presentation?

**Authenticity:** We want to see the real you, not a performance
**Clarity:** We should understand your goals and why they matter to you
**Growth:** We should see evidence you've learned and changed this semester
**Professionalism:** We should see you're ready to enter the professional world
