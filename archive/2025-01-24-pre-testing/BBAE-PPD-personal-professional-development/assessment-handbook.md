# **SECTION 1: Individual Assignment - Reflective Essay (10%)**

## **Assignment Overview**

Write a reflective essay on the field trip to MISA Joint Stock Company and the guest speaker session with Ms. Ha Linh, focusing on the question:

**"What do these activities inform you about your preparation for your future career?"**

## **Requirements**

- **Length:** Maximum 1,500 words
- **Format:** Use a clear reflective framework (Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, or Driscoll & Bolton's "What? So what? Now what?" model)
- **Academic Integrity:** You may use AI to find examples or clarify concepts, but you must write your own reflection. Using AI to write your essay defeats the purpose entirely.
- **Due:** TBD (will be announced after completion of field trip and guest speaker sessions)

## **Content Structure**

### **1. Brief Activity Description (200-300 words)**

- Concise overview of both the field trip and guest speaker session
- Focus on key moments rather than detailed chronological accounts
- Set the context for your reflection

### **2. Critical Reflection & Analysis (900-1000 words)**

**Quality reflection includes:**

- **Self-awareness:** Honest examination of your thoughts, feelings, assumptions, and reactions
- **Critical thinking:** Going beyond "what happened" to analyze "why it matters" and "what it means"
- **Integration:** Connecting experiences to your existing knowledge, skills, and personal insights
- **Evidence-based insights:** Using specific examples from the activities to support your reflections

**Include:**

- Key insights, observations, and learning points from each activity
- How these insights relate to your personal development and future career preparation
- Integration with course concepts (e.g., your MBTI personality type, emotional intelligence scores, communication styles)
- Critical analysis of challenges, surprises, or contradictions you experienced
- Honest evaluation of your current strengths and areas for development

### **3. Future Action Planning (300-400 words)**

- Specific, measurable actions you will take to improve your career readiness
- Timeline for implementation
- How you will measure progress or success

## **Writing Tips**

- **Use first person ("I")** - this is a personal reflection
- **Balance description with analysis** - spend more time on "so what?" than "what?"
- **Use specific examples** rather than general statements
- **Connect your experiences** to broader concepts and theories
- **Maintain an academic tone** while being personally honest

## **Submission Requirements**

- **Format:** Microsoft Word (.docx) or PDF
- **File Naming:** StudentNumber_FirstName_ReflectiveEssay_Date.docx
- **Submit via:** Moodle
- **Deadline:** 11:59 PM on due date (TBD)

## **Time Management Guide**

**Suggested 10-Minute Structure:**

| Time | Section | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0:00-1:00 | Opening | Hook + introduce yourself + preview |
| 1:00-3:00 | Self-Discovery Journey | Key insights from assessments, values, strengths |
| 3:00-5:00 | Career Vision & Goals | Your 1-3-5 year plan, why these goals |
| 5:00-7:00 | Learning Integration | Mentorship impact, course insights, growth |
| 7:00-9:00 | Strategies & Commitment | How you'll achieve goals, your commitment |
| 9:00-10:00 | Closing | Synthesis, memorable closing thought |

**Practice tip:** If you go over 10:30 in practice, you WILL go over in the actual presentation due to nerves. Cut content until you're at 9:30-10:00 in practice.

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Reading slides word-for-word** - Slides should support, not be your script
2. **Too much content** - Better to go deep on fewer points than rush through many
3. **No personal story** - This is about YOUR journey, make it personal
4. **Generic goals** - "Get a good job" is not compelling; be specific
5. **Ignoring the audience** - Make eye contact, engage, read the room
6. **No energy** - This is your future! Show some passion
7. **Unprepared for questions** - Think ahead about what might be asked
8. **Going way over/under time** - Practice timing!

## **What Makes an Excellent Presentation?**

- **Authenticity:** We want to see the real you, not a performance
- **Clarity:** We should understand your goals and why they matter to you
- **Growth:** We should see evidence you've learned and changed this semester
- **Professionalism:** We should see you're ready to enter the professional world
- **Inspiration:** Your commitment to development should be contagious

**Remember:** This is not just an exam. This is practice for job interviews, pitch presentations, and professional communication you'll do throughout your career. Take it seriously and use it as a growth opportunity.
