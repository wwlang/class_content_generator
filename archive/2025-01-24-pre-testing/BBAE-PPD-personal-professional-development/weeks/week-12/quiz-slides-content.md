## Speaker Notes

This is a practice quiz covering Week 12 concepts on personal mastery frameworks, Drive Theory, and sustainable learning systems. Students should answer individually before discussing with partners.

**SLIDE 2: Question 1 - Creative Tension**

TITLE: Question 1: Creative Tension

CONTENT:

According to Senge's personal mastery framework, "creative tension" refers to:

**A)** Stress from having too many goals

**B)** The gap between current reality and personal vision that motivates growth

**C)** Tension between work and personal life

**D)** Conflict with family over career choices

---

## Speaker Notes

Give students 30-45 seconds to consider the question. This tests understanding of Senge's personal mastery concept from today's lecture. Creative tension is a key concept for the Development Plan presentation.

---

**SLIDE 3: Question 2 - Drive Theory**

TITLE: Question 2: Drive Theory

CONTENT:

Pink's Drive Theory identifies three elements of intrinsic motivation. Which is NOT one of them?

**A)** Autonomy

**B)** Mastery

**C)** Salary

**D)** Purpose

---

## Speaker Notes

Students should recognize the three drives (autonomy, mastery, purpose) from the lecture. Salary is an external motivator, not intrinsic. This concept is crucial for explaining WHY goals matter in the oral exam.

---

**SLIDE 4: Question 3 - Sustainable Learning Systems**

TITLE: Question 3: Sustainable Learning Systems

CONTENT:

A sustainable learning system includes all of these components EXCEPT:

**A)** Clear outcomes (SMART goals)

**B)** Feedback loops (regular self-assessment)

**C)** Perfect execution without mistakes

**D)** Adaptive adjustment (revising goals based on learning)

---

## Speaker Notes

This question tests understanding that perfectionism is NOT part of sustainable systems. Growth comes from learning from mistakes, not avoiding them. Students often struggle with this in Vietnamese educational context where mistakes are sometimes seen negatively.

---

**SLIDE 5: Question 4 - Rubric Criteria**

TITLE: Question 4: Rubric Criteria

CONTENT:

In your Final Oral Exam, explaining WHY your goals matter using Drive Theory (autonomy, mastery, purpose) primarily addresses which rubric criterion?

**A)** Content Depth & Self-Awareness

**B)** Goal Clarity & Strategic Thinking

**C)** Integration of Learning

**D)** Delivery & Professional Presence

---

## Speaker Notes

This connects quiz content to the actual assessment rubric. Strategic Thinking (25% of rubric) specifically evaluates explanation of WHY goals matter. This helps students understand how to structure their presentation for maximum points.

---

**SLIDE 6: Question 5 - Growth Mindset**

TITLE: Question 5: Growth Mindset

CONTENT:

Dweck's growth mindset is essential for personal mastery because:

**A)** It makes you smarter

**B)** It ensures you never fail

**C)** It helps you believe abilities can be developed through practice

**D)** It eliminates creative tension

---

## Speaker Notes

Growth mindset (belief that abilities can be developed) is foundational for personal mastery. This concept appeared in multiple weeks but is especially relevant for the Development Plan's focus on continuous improvement.

---

**SLIDE 7: Question 6 - Habit Stacking**

TITLE: Question 6: Habit Stacking

CONTENT:

James Clear's "habit stacking" technique involves:

**A)** Adding many new habits at once

**B)** Only focusing on big changes

**C)** Connecting a new habit to an existing routine

**D)** Avoiding routines to stay flexible

---

## Speaker Notes

Habit stacking connects new habits to existing routines. This is a practical implementation technique students can use in their Development Plans. Example: "After morning coffee, review one Development Plan goal."

---

**SLIDE 8: Question 7 - Cultural Context**

TITLE: Question 7: Cultural Context

CONTENT:

In Vietnamese cultural context, "autonomy" in career planning means:

**A)** Rejecting all family input on career decisions

**B)** Self-direction while still honoring family values and seeking guidance

**C)** Making decisions completely independently without mentors

**D)** Avoiding traditional career paths entirely

---

## Speaker Notes

This culturally-sensitive question clarifies that autonomy = self-direction, not isolation. In collectivist Vietnamese culture, students can honor family values and seek guidance while still making autonomous choices. Important distinction for Development Plans.

---

**SLIDE 9: Question 8 - System Components**

TITLE: Question 8: System Components

CONTENT:

The four components of a sustainable learning system are:

**A)** Goals, grades, certificates, salary

**B)** Clear outcomes, feedback loops, deliberate practice, adaptive adjustment

**C)** Reading, writing, presenting, testing

**D)** Autonomy, mastery, purpose, vision

---

## Speaker Notes

Final question reinforces the complete framework for sustainable learning systems. Students should be able to list all four research-backed components. This system should be reflected in their Development Plan implementation section.
