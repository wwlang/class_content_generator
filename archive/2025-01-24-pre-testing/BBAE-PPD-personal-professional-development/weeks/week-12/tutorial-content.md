### MAIN ACTIVITY: Practice Oral Presentations (60 minutes)

**Setup** (5 minutes):

1. Find a partner you're comfortable practicing with
2. Bring out your Development Plan document
3. Bring out presentation slides (draft is fine) OR detailed outline
4. Set timer on phone for 10-minute presentations
5. Get Peer Feedback Form from instructor (simplified rubric)

**Round 1: First Presentation Practice** (35 minutes total)

**Individual Presentation (10 min each = 20 min total):**
- Partner A presents for 10 minutes (timed)
- Partner B listens, takes notes on feedback form
- Switch: Partner B presents for 10 minutes
- Partner A listens, takes notes

**Presentation Structure Reminder:**
1. Opening (1 min): Hook + overview
2. Self-Discovery (2 min): Key assessment insights
3. Values & Vision (2 min): Core values, 5-year vision (include purpose!)
4. Goals (3 min): 1-3-5 year goals (explain autonomy, mastery, purpose)
5. Integration (1.5 min): Mentorship, course concepts, frameworks
6. Implementation (30 sec): Your sustainable learning system
7. Closing (30 sec): Commitment to personal mastery

**Peer Review Using Simplified Rubric (15 minutes):**

Partners exchange feedback using these sentence starters:

**Content Depth (35%):**
- "One strength in your self-awareness was..."
- "Your growth narrative was authentic when you..."
- "To strengthen content depth, consider..."

**Strategic Thinking (25%):**
- "Your goals were clear, especially..."
- "I understood WHY your goals matter when you explained..."
- "To improve strategic thinking, you could..."

**Integration (15%):**
- "You effectively integrated [specific framework/concept]..."
- "To show more integration, consider mentioning..."

**Delivery (25%):**
- "Your delivery strengths: eye contact / vocal variety / confidence / professional presence"
- "Timing: [under 10 min / perfect / over 10 min by X seconds]"
- "To improve delivery: [specific suggestion]"

---

**Break (5 minutes)**

Get water, stretch, review peer feedback privately

---

**Round 2: Revised Presentation Practice** (20 minutes total)

**Instructions:**
- Incorporate ONE piece of feedback from your partner
- Focus on improving your weakest rubric area
- Present again for 10 minutes each (timed)

**Individual Presentation (10 min each = 20 min total):**
- Partner A presents revised version (10 min)
- Partner B observes improvements
- Switch: Partner B presents revised version (10 min)
- Partner A observes improvements

**Quick Feedback (5 min total):**
- 2 minutes per person
- Share: "One improvement I noticed..." and "One suggestion for actual exam..."

---

**Instructor Debrief** (10 minutes):

**Common Strengths Observed:**
- Most students have strong content (Development Plans are well-developed)
- Good use of personal examples and authentic storytelling
- Clear SMART goals with appropriate timeframes

**Typical Areas Needing Work:**
- **Timing:** Many go over 10 minutes (cut examples, not key content)
- **Framework Integration:** Some presentations list goals without explaining WHY they matter (use Drive Theory!)
- **Delivery:** Reading slides word-for-word (practice without script)
- **Professional Presence:** Need stronger eye contact, vocal variety

**How This Connects to Graded Assessment:**

Today's practice = LOW STAKES. Actual exam = 30% of grade.

**Key differences:**
- Today: Practice with peer, informal feedback
- Actual exam: Present to instructors, formal grading
- Today: Draft slides acceptable
- Actual exam: Professional, polished slides required
- Today: Can restart if you mess up
- Actual exam: One chance, must stay composed

**Three Actions Before Exam:**
1. **Practice OUT LOUD 3 more times** (alone or with friend) - timing yourself
2. **Revise slides** based on today's feedback - mostly visual, not text-heavy
3. **Integrate frameworks** from today's lecture - personal mastery, Drive Theory, learning systems

### QUIZ PREPARATION (15 minutes)

**Practice Questions** (10 minutes):

Answer these questions individually. Check answers with partner after.

**Question 1:** According to Senge's personal mastery framework, "creative tension" refers to:
A) Stress from having too many goals
B) The gap between current reality and personal vision that motivates growth
C) Tension between work and personal life
D) Conflict with family over career choices

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Creative tension is the productive gap between where you are now and where you want to be. This tension creates natural energy for change and growth (Senge, 2006).

---

**Question 2:** Pink's Drive Theory identifies three elements of intrinsic motivation. Which is NOT one of them?
A) Autonomy
B) Mastery
C) Salary
D) Purpose

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Pink's three drives are autonomy (self-direction), mastery (getting better at skills), and purpose (connecting to larger meaning). Salary is an external motivator that doesn't sustain long-term (Pink, 2009).

---

**Question 3:** A sustainable learning system includes all of these components EXCEPT:
A) Clear outcomes (SMART goals)
B) Feedback loops (regular self-assessment)
C) Perfect execution without mistakes
D) Adaptive adjustment (revising goals based on learning)

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Sustainable systems include clear outcomes, feedback loops, deliberate practice, and adaptive adjustment. Perfectionism is not required - growth comes from learning from mistakes (Zimmerman, 2002).

---

**Question 4:** In your Final Oral Exam, explaining WHY your goals matter using Drive Theory (autonomy, mastery, purpose) primarily addresses which rubric criterion?
A) Content Depth & Self-Awareness
B) Goal Clarity & Strategic Thinking
C) Integration of Learning
D) Delivery & Professional Presence

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Strategic Thinking (25% of rubric) looks for clear explanation of WHY goals matter and how they connect to values/vision. Using Drive Theory demonstrates strategic thinking about intrinsic motivation.

---

**Question 5:** Dweck's growth mindset is essential for personal mastery because:
A) It makes you smarter
B) It ensures you never fail
C) It helps you believe abilities can be developed through practice
D) It eliminates creative tension

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Growth mindset = belief that abilities can be improved through effort and strategy. This belief is necessary for personal mastery, which assumes continuous development is possible (Dweck, 2006).

---

**Question 6:** James Clear's "habit stacking" technique involves:
A) Adding many new habits at once
B) Only focusing on big changes
C) Connecting a new habit to an existing routine
D) Avoiding routines to stay flexible

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Habit stacking connects a new tiny habit to an existing routine you already do automatically (e.g., "After morning coffee, review one Development Plan goal"). This makes new habits stick (Clear, 2018).

---

**Question 7:** In Vietnamese cultural context, "autonomy" in career planning means:
A) Rejecting all family input on career decisions
B) Self-direction while still honoring family values and seeking guidance
C) Making decisions completely independently without mentors
D) Avoiding traditional career paths entirely

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Autonomy = self-direction, not isolation. In collectivist Vietnamese culture, you can honor family values and seek guidance while still making autonomous choices about HOW to integrate that input (Pink, 2009).

---

**Question 8:** The four components of a sustainable learning system are:
A) Goals, grades, certificates, salary
B) Clear outcomes, feedback loops, deliberate practice, adaptive adjustment
C) Reading, writing, presenting, testing
D) Autonomy, mastery, purpose, vision

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Sustainable learning systems have four research-backed components: clear outcomes (Locke & Latham), feedback loops (Hattie), deliberate practice (Ericsson), and adaptive adjustment (Zimmerman).

---

**Review & Discussion** (5 minutes):

**Quick poll:** How many got 6+ correct? (Most should)

**Key concepts to remember:**
- Personal mastery = lifelong discipline, not one-time achievement
- Intrinsic motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose) sustains better than external rewards
- Sustainable systems require clear goals + feedback + deliberate practice + adaptation
- Growth mindset enables personal mastery
- Autonomy ≠ independence; you can be autonomous while honoring guidance

**Connection to Exam:**
These frameworks help you articulate your Development Plan with depth and strategic thinking = higher rubric scores.

### WRAP-UP (5 minutes)

**Self-Assessment Against Rubric** (3 minutes):

Reflect privately:

1. **Content Depth:** On a scale 1-10, how well do I show genuine self-awareness and authentic growth narrative?
   - If <7: What specific example from self-assessments should I add?

2. **Strategic Thinking:** On a scale 1-10, how clearly do I explain WHY my goals matter?
   - If <7: Which goal needs Drive Theory explanation (autonomy/mastery/purpose)?

3. **Integration:** On a scale 1-10, how well do I connect course concepts and mentorship?
   - If <7: Which framework from today will I explicitly mention?

4. **Delivery:** On a scale 1-10, how confident and professional is my delivery?
   - If <7: What will I practice 3x before exam (timing/eye contact/vocal variety)?

**What to Revise Before Exam** (1 minute):

Based on today's practice, write down:
- ONE content improvement (add specific example or explanation)
- ONE delivery improvement (timing, confidence, eye contact, etc.)
- ONE framework from today's lecture to integrate

**Next Steps for Assessment Preparation** (1 minute):

**Before the Exam:**
1. **Practice 3x OUT LOUD** alone or with friend, timing yourself (9:30-10:30 is ideal)
2. **Revise slides** - professional design, mostly visual, not text-heavy (use Canva if needed)
3. **Integrate frameworks** - explicitly mention personal mastery OR Drive Theory OR learning systems
4. **Review rubric** - Assessment Handbook Section 4, understand all four criteria
5. **Arrive 5 min early** - set up, breathe, compose yourself before presenting

**Remember:** You have strong content (your Development Plan). Today gave you practice with DELIVERY and strategies to show DEPTH and INTEGRATION.

**Final encouragement:** Your 12 weeks of work are evident in your Development Plans. The exam is your chance to SHARE your growth story confidently. Use today's feedback to refine your presentation. Practice out loud. You're ready!

## TUTORIAL NOTES FOR INSTRUCTOR

**Materials Needed:**
- Peer Feedback Forms (simplified rubric with 4 criteria) - 1 per student
- Timer (for 10-minute presentations)
- Copy of Assessment Handbook Section 4 rubric for reference

**Room Setup:**
- Students in pairs spread out (enough space for presentations)
- Access to projector if students want to practice with slides

**Cultural Considerations for Vietnamese Students:**
- Presentations can be anxiety-inducing in Vietnamese educational context (less emphasis on oral presentation skills)
- Provide structured feedback frameworks (sentence starters) - helps students give constructive feedback without causing loss of face
- Emphasize LOW STAKES nature of today's practice - mistakes are learning opportunities
- Model confident delivery if students seem nervous - "Watch how I present this slide..."
- Affirm cultural values (family, contribution) as legitimate parts of purpose/autonomy discussion

**Differentiation:**

**For Struggling Students:**
- Provide detailed outline template for presentation structure
- Allow extra practice round if time permits
- Focus on ONE rubric criterion to improve (usually timing or delivery)
- Reassure: Content is strong, just need practice delivering it

**For Advanced Students:**
- Challenge: Integrate multiple frameworks (Senge + Pink + learning systems) seamlessly
- Focus on Q&A practice: "What questions might instructors ask you?"
- Suggest adding specific research citations during presentation (like today's lecture did)
- Encourage mentoring struggling peers during practice rounds

**Common Instructor Observations:**
- Students often go 12-14 minutes on first try (need to cut examples, practice pacing)
- Many read slides word-for-word (need to practice without script, use slides as visual support only)
- Some forget to explain WHY goals matter (just listing what goals are - need Drive Theory application)
- Vocal variety often weak (monotone delivery) - model using pauses, emphasis, enthusiasm
- Eye contact varies culturally - some students look down out of respect (clarify: exam requires eye contact with instructors as professional skill)

**Time Management:**
- Opening: 10 min (strict)
- Round 1: 35 min (20 present + 15 feedback)
- Break: 5 min
- Round 2: 25 min (20 present + 5 quick feedback)
- Debrief: 10 min
- Quiz prep: 15 min
- Wrap: 5 min
- **Total: 90 min**

If running over time: Cut break to 3 min or reduce quiz prep to 10 min (fewer questions).
