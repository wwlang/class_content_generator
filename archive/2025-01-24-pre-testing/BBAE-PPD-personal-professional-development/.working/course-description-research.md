## Draft Course Description

*Personal and Professional Development* prepares you to navigate your career with clarity, confidence, and adaptability in an era of rapid technological change. Drawing on research from leading business schools, this course recognizes that self-awareness, intentional development, and a growth mindset are essential foundations for professional success. As artificial intelligence reshapes the workplace and career paths become increasingly dynamic, the ability to understand yourself, continuously learn, and strategically develop your capabilities has never been more critical.

This course integrates theory with intensive practical application. You will engage in evidence-based self-assessment (MBTI, VIA Character Strengths, CliftonStrengths, Holland Code) to understand your personality, values, motivations, and strengths. Through reflective writing, experiential learning activities, and a structured mentorship program with business professionals, you will develop key transferable skills including emotional intelligence, time and energy management, and adaptive thinking. The course explores frameworks for learning how to learn (self-managed learning), building resilience through growth mindset, and designing evidence-based career development strategies. A field trip to a company or innovation hub and guest speaker sessions provide real-world perspectives on workplace expectations and career trajectories.

By the end of this course, you will have created a comprehensive Personal and Professional Development Plan with concrete 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year goals aligned with your authentic values and strengths. You will present your development plan in a professional TED-talk format, demonstrating both your self-knowledge and communication capabilities. More importantly, you will have established habits of reflection, continuous learning, and intentional development that will serve you throughout your career. This course doesn't just prepare you for your first job—it equips you with the mindset and tools to thrive across a lifetime of professional growth and adaptation.
