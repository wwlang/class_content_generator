## Detailed Assessment Breakdown

### 1. Individual Assignment - Reflective Essay (10%)

**Task:** Write a reflective essay on the field trip to MISA Joint Stock Company and the guest speaker session with Ms. Ha Linh, focusing on the question: *What do these activities inform you about your preparation for your future career?*

**Requirements:**
- **Length:** Maximum 1,500 words
- **Format:** Use a clear reflective framework (Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, or Driscoll & Bolton's "What? So what? Now what?" model)
- **Academic Integrity:** You may use AI to find examples or clarify concepts, but you must write your own reflection. Using AI to write your essay defeats the purpose entirely.

**Content Structure:**

1. **Brief Activity Description (200-300 words)**
   - Concise overview of both the field trip and guest speaker session
   - Focus on key moments rather than detailed chronological accounts

2. **Critical Reflection & Analysis (900-1000 words)**

   Quality reflection includes:
   - **Self-awareness:** Honest examination of your thoughts, feelings, assumptions, and reactions
   - **Critical thinking:** Going beyond "what happened" to analyze "why it matters" and "what it means"
   - **Integration:** Connecting experiences to your existing knowledge, skills, and personal insights
   - **Evidence-based insights:** Using specific examples from the activities to support your reflections

   Include:
   - Key insights, observations, and learning points from each activity
   - How these insights relate to your personal development and future career preparation
   - Integration with course concepts (e.g., your MBTI personality type, emotional intelligence scores, communication styles)
   - Critical analysis of challenges, surprises, or contradictions you experienced
   - Honest evaluation of your current strengths and areas for development

3. **Future Action Planning (300-400 words)**
   - Specific, measurable actions you will take to improve your career readiness
   - Timeline for implementation
   - How you will measure progress or success

**Writing Tips:**
- Use first person ("I") - this is a personal reflection
- Balance description with analysis (spend more time on "so what?" than "what?")
- Use specific examples rather than general statements
- Connect your experiences to broader concepts and theories
- Maintain an academic tone while being personally honest

**Submission:**
- Format: Microsoft Word (.docx) or PDF
- File Naming: StudentNumber_FirstName_ReflectiveEssay_Date.docx
- Deadline: TBD (will be announced after completion of field trip and guest speaker sessions)
