# Course Package Guide
## {course_name} ({course_code})

This package contains everything you need to deliver the course. You'll find the syllabus, assessment materials, weekly lecture slides, tutorial activities, and quizzes—all ready to upload to Moodle and use in your teaching.

Before semester starts, upload the syllabus, handbook, and week-01 materials to Moodle. Test that the GIFT quiz files import correctly, and share the tutor guide with your teaching team. Each week, review the slides and speaker notes a few days ahead, make sure tutors have the tutorial materials, and release the weekly quiz after tutorials.

Feel free to adapt examples to your local context and adjust timings for your class size. The content builds progressively week by week, and tutorials deliberately scaffold assessment skills—these connections matter, so keep them intact when making changes.
