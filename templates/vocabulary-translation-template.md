## Guidelines for Term Selection

**Select 5-8 terms per lecture that are:**

1. **Central to the topic** - Used multiple times in lecture
2. **Technically complex** - Not everyday English
3. **Potentially confusing** - Multiple meanings or discipline-specific
4. **Essential for assessment** - Students need to know for exams/projects

**Avoid:**
- Basic English words students likely know
- Terms that are cognates (similar in Vietnamese)
- Too many terms (overwhelming)

---

## Translation Resources

### Primary Resources:

1. **Business English-Vietnamese Dictionary**
   - Online: tracau.vn, vdict.com
   - Look for business/economics context

2. **Academic Glossaries**
   - Vietnamese university business textbooks
   - Existing course materials from Vietnamese institutions

3. **Google Translate** (with verification)
   - Use as starting point
   - Verify with Vietnamese business sources
   - Check multiple translations

4. **Vietnamese Business Publications**
   - vnexpress.net/business (bilingual)
   - Vietnamese newspapers' business sections
   - How terms are actually used in Vietnamese business context

### Translation Quality Check:

- Does this match how Vietnamese business people use the term?
- Is this the academic translation or colloquial?
- Would a Vietnamese business student recognize this?
- Is there more than one valid translation? (List both if so)

## Best Practices

### Pronunciation Guide:
- Use simplified phonetic spelling
- Break into syllables
- Mark tone if relevant (Vietnamese is tonal)
- Optional: Record audio pronunciation for online materials

### Visual Support:
- Consider icons or simple images next to terms
- Color-code by concept type (e.g., financial terms in blue)
- Use Vietnamese and English in consistent formatting

### Interactive Element:
- Ask students to repeat terms aloud (builds confidence)
- Quick practice: "Turn to partner and use one term in a sentence"
- Reference vocabulary slide throughout lecture ("Remember our term 'leverage'?")

### Digital Support:
- Provide vocabulary list in Moodle before class
- Create flashcards (Quizlet) with Vietnamese translations
- Include in tutorial handouts with space for notes

---

## Integration with Tutorial

**Tutorial Opening** should also reference vocabulary:

```markdown
### OPENING (10 minutes)

**Quick Review:**
- [Concept 1 in English] (Remember: [Vietnamese term])
- [Concept 2 in English] (Remember: [Vietnamese term])
- [Concept 3 in English] (Remember: [Vietnamese term])

**Check understanding:** "Can someone explain [term] in their own words?"
```

## Research Process for Translations

When generating vocabulary translations:

1. **Identify key terms** from lecture content (5-8 most important)

2. **Use WebSearch to verify translations:**
   ```
   "[English term]" "Vietnamese translation" business
   "[English term]" tiếng Việt business English
   "[English term]" định nghĩa [academic context]
   ```

3. **Cross-reference with Vietnamese sources:**
   - Check Vietnamese business textbooks
   - Look at Vietnamese university materials
   - Verify in Vietnamese business news

4. **Provide alternative translations** if term has multiple valid translations:
   ```
   **Differentiation** → Khác biệt hóa / Sự khác biệt
   (Both are correct; first is more common in business context)
   ```

5. **Note contextual usage:**
   - Academic context vs. business context
   - Formal vs. informal usage
   - Regional variations (Northern vs. Southern Vietnam)
