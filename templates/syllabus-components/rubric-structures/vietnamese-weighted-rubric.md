# Vietnamese Weighted Rubric Template

**For Vietnamese grading systems where assessments are scored out of 10 marks with weighted criteria.**

## **Vietnamese Weighted Scoring System**

### **Core Principle:**
- Each assessment is scored out of **10 marks** total
- Each criterion/component is scored **0-10**, then **weighted**
- Weighted scores sum to the total out of 10
- Total score is multiplied by assessment weight for final grade contribution

### **Formula:**
```
Total Score = (Criterion₁/10 × Weight₁) + (Criterion₂/10 × Weight₂) + ... + (Criterionₙ/10 × Weightₙ)
Final Grade Contribution = (Total Score / 10) × Assessment Weight %
```

## **Template Structure**

### **Assessment Rubric (Total: 10 marks)**

| **Criteria** | **Weight** | **9-10 (Excellent)** | **7-8 (Good)** | **5-6 (Satisfactory)** | **3-4 (Limited)** | **0-2 (Inadequate)** |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **[Criterion 1 Name]** | XX% | [Descriptor for excellent performance] | [Descriptor for good performance] | [Descriptor for satisfactory performance] | [Descriptor for limited performance] | [Descriptor for inadequate performance] |
| **[Criterion 2 Name]** | XX% | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] |
| **[Criterion 3 Name]** | XX% | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] |
| **[Criterion 4 Name]** | XX% | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] | [Descriptor] |

**Calculation:** Each criterion is scored 0-10, then weighted:
- (Criterion 1/10 × 0.XX) + (Criterion 2/10 × 0.XX) + (Criterion 3/10 × 0.XX) + (Criterion 4/10 × 0.XX) = **Total out of 10**

**Scoring:** This assessment is scored out of 10 marks. Your final grade contribution is calculated as: **(Score / 10) × XX% = Your contribution to course grade**

*Example: If you score 8/10, your contribution = (8/10) × XX% = X.X% toward your final course grade*

## **Example: Written Assignment Rubric (Total: 10 marks)**

| **Criteria** | **Weight** | **9-10 (Excellent)** | **7-8 (Good)** | **5-6 (Satisfactory)** | **3-4 (Limited)** | **0-2 (Inadequate)** |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Content & Analysis** | 30% | Exceptional depth of analysis. Complex understanding demonstrated. Insightful connections made. All key points thoroughly addressed. | Good analytical depth. Clear understanding shown. Meaningful connections made. Most key points well addressed. | Basic analysis present. Adequate understanding. Some connections made. Key points addressed but may lack depth. | Limited analysis. Surface-level understanding. Few connections. Some key points missing or weak. | No meaningful analysis. Poor understanding. No connections. Most key points missing. |
| **Organization & Structure** | 25% | Exceptionally clear and logical structure. Perfect flow and transitions. Guides reader effortlessly through argument. | Clear structure with good flow. Effective transitions. Generally easy to follow. | Adequate structure. Basic organization evident. Some transitions. Generally followable. | Weak structure. Poor organization. Few transitions. Difficult to follow. | No clear structure. Confusing organization. No transitions. Very difficult to follow. |
| **Evidence & Support** | 25% | Excellent use of relevant, credible evidence. All claims strongly supported. Sources expertly integrated. | Good use of evidence. Claims generally well supported. Sources appropriately used. | Basic evidence provided. Some claims supported. Sources used but may be limited. | Limited evidence. Weak support for claims. Poor use of sources. | No meaningful evidence. Claims unsupported. Sources absent or inappropriate. |
| **Writing Quality** | 15% | Excellent writing with clear, engaging prose. Virtually error-free. Appropriate academic tone throughout. | Good writing with clear expression. Minor errors. Generally appropriate tone. | Adequate writing with some clarity issues. Some errors but meaning clear. Generally appropriate tone. | Weak writing with frequent issues. Regular errors impede understanding. Inappropriate tone. | Poor writing that impedes understanding. Numerous serious errors. Tone completely inappropriate. |
| **Formatting & Citations** | 5% | Perfect formatting. All citations correct and complete. Follows style guide exactly. | Good formatting. Citations mostly correct. Minor style guide deviations. | Adequate formatting. Some citation errors. Some style guide issues. | Poor formatting. Many citation errors. Significant style guide problems. | No proper formatting. Citations missing or incorrect. No adherence to style guide. |

**Calculation:** Each criterion is scored 0-10, then weighted:
- (Content/10 × 0.30) + (Organization/10 × 0.25) + (Evidence/10 × 0.25) + (Writing/10 × 0.15) + (Formatting/10 × 0.05) = **Total out of 10**

**Scoring:** This assessment is scored out of 10 marks. Your final grade contribution is calculated as: **(Score / 10) × 20% = Your contribution to course grade**

*Example: If you score 8/10, your contribution = (8/10) × 20% = 16% toward your final course grade*

## **Guidelines for Creating Vietnamese Weighted Rubrics**

### **1. Determine Weights**

**Weight criteria by importance:**
- Primary criteria (content, analysis, core competencies): 25-35%
- Secondary criteria (organization, methodology): 15-25%
- Supporting criteria (writing quality, formatting): 10-15%
- Minor criteria (formatting, citations): 5-10%

**Ensure weights sum to 100%**

### **2. Performance Bands**

**Use consistent bands across all criteria:**
- **9-10 (Excellent)**: Exceptional, sophisticated, expertly executed
- **7-8 (Good)**: Strong, clear, well-executed
- **5-6 (Satisfactory)**: Adequate, basic, acceptable
- **3-4 (Limited)**: Weak, poor, below expectations
- **0-2 (Inadequate)**: Missing, very poor, unacceptable

### **3. Write Clear Descriptors**

**Each descriptor should:**
- Be specific to the criterion
- Differentiate clearly from adjacent bands
- Use consistent language across criteria
- Avoid vague terms ("nice," "okay")
- Focus on observable evidence

**Good descriptor:** "Demonstrates exceptional self-awareness with honest, insightful self-evaluation"
**Poor descriptor:** "Good reflection shown"

### **4. Provide Calculation Formula**

**Always include:**
- Weighted calculation formula showing how to combine criterion scores
- Final grade contribution formula
- Example calculation with actual numbers

### **5. Number of Criteria**

**Recommended:**
- **Simple assessments**: 3-4 criteria
- **Standard assessments**: 4-6 criteria
- **Complex assessments**: 6-8 criteria (maximum)

**Too many criteria** → Grading becomes tedious, distinctions blur
**Too few criteria** → Assessment lacks nuance, feedback is vague

## **Conversion Between Systems**

### **Vietnamese (40% pass) → US (60% pass)**

| Vietnamese | % | US Letter | % |
|------------|---|-----------|---|
| A (Xuất Sắc) | 85-100 | A | 90-100 |
| B (Giỏi) | 70-84 | B | 80-89 |
