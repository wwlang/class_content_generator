## Customization Instructions

When adapting this rubric for specific projects:

1. **Adjust criteria based on project type** (research paper vs. business plan vs. case analysis)
2. **Add discipline-specific criteria** (e.g., "Financial Analysis" for business plans, "Literature Review" for research papers)
3. **Modify weight of criteria** based on project emphasis
4. **Clarify technical requirements** in rubric or separate document

## Example Customizations

### For Research Papers:
- Add criterion: "Literature Review Quality"
- Add criterion: "Methodology & Research Design"
- Emphasize "Use of Evidence & Citations"
- Add "Contribution to Field" if graduate-level

### For Business Plans:
- Add criterion: "Financial Projections & Analysis"
- Add criterion: "Market Analysis & Competitive Positioning"
- Add criterion: "Feasibility & Implementation Plan"
- Modify "Research & Analysis" to focus on market research

### For Case Analyses:
- Add criterion: "Problem Identification"
- Add criterion: "Alternative Solutions Analysis"
- Add criterion: "Recommendations & Implementation"
- Modify "Content & Argumentation" to emphasize case-specific reasoning

### For Group Projects:
- Add "Individual Contribution" criterion
- Include peer evaluation component
- Consider milestone grades (proposal, draft, final)

## Milestone Grading Framework

For projects with multiple milestones:

| Milestone | Weight | Criteria Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Proposal** | 15-20% | Topic selection, preliminary research, project scope, feasibility |
| **Draft** | 25-30% | Structure, content development, research progress, citation format |
| **Final** | 50-60% | All criteria fully applied; completion, polish, depth |
