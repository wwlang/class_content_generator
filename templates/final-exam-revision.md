## How to Prepare

All weekly practice quizzes are now set to **unlimited attempts**. These are your main revision tool.

**Revision strategy:**
1. Complete each week's quiz
2. For any unfamiliar terms, search for that term within the slides
3. Watch the NotebookLM summary videos for extra help on difficult concepts
4. Re-take the quiz until you're confident

The exam draws from the same material as the practice quizzes. If you know the quizzes, you'll do well.
