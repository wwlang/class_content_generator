# Course Evaluation Survey: Distribution Method Evaluation

## Executive Recommendation: LMS Integration (Moodle/Blackboard)

Based on empirical research, **LMS-embedded surveys are strongly recommended** over external tools like Google Forms for course evaluations. Here's the evidence-based analysis:

## Comparison Matrix

| Factor | LMS-Embedded (Moodle/Blackboard) | Google Forms |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| **Response Rates** | Higher (up to 200% improvement with integration) | Lower (students must navigate away) |
| **Friction** | Minimal - students already logged in | Higher - requires separate login/link |
| **Reminders** | Automated within LMS, pop-up reminders | Manual email reminders only |
| **Anonymity Trust** | Institutional credibility | May raise privacy concerns |
| **In-Class Administration** | Native support, visible in course | Requires sharing external link |
| **Data Integration** | Links to student records, course data | Standalone, manual export |
| **Reporting** | Built-in analytics, longitudinal tracking | Basic charts, requires Sheets |
| **Cost** | Included with LMS | Free (100 response limit on some features) |
| **Mobile-Friendly** | Yes (native apps) | Yes |
| **ESL Accessibility** | Same as content language | Same |

## Key Research Findings

### 1. LMS Integration Dramatically Improves Response Rates
- Universities using LMS integration have seen **sustained improvement in evaluation response rates**
- Pop-up reminders in Blackboard Ultra made a "substantial difference" in student participation
- One university reported a **200% increase** in response rates after implementing LMS-integrated evaluations

### 2. Reducing Friction is Critical
- The **biggest obstacle** is getting students to actively navigate to a separate system
- LMS surveys appear when students log in for coursework - no extra steps
- Students can complete evaluations **in the same environment** they use daily

### 3. In-Class Time Allocation Works Best
- Research shows giving students **10-15 minutes in class** yields near-perfect completion rates
- LMS surveys can be completed on any device during class time
- QR codes linking to LMS surveys provide the best of both approaches

### 4. Google Forms Advantages (Limited)
- More detailed open-ended responses (students take more time)
- Simpler setup for instructors unfamiliar with LMS tools
- Automatic summarization in Google Sheets

## Recommendation for Your Context

Since you use **both Moodle and Blackboard**, I recommend:

1. **Primary Distribution**: Use the native Feedback activity (Moodle) or Survey tool (Blackboard)
2. **Administration**: Allocate 10 minutes of class time near course end
3. **Reminders**: Enable LMS notifications 1 week before deadline
4. **Anonymity**: Configure for anonymous responses (both platforms support this)

## Files Provided

I've created importable files for both platforms:

| File | Platform | How to Import |
|------|----------|---------------|
| `moodle_feedback_survey.xml` | Moodle 3.x/4.x | Feedback activity → Templates → Import questions |
| `blackboard_survey.txt` | Blackboard Original/Ultra | Surveys → Create Survey → Upload Questions |

### Moodle Import Instructions
1. Create a new Feedback activity in your course
2. Go to Templates tab → Import questions
3. Upload the XML file
4. Configure anonymity and availability dates

### Blackboard Import Instructions
1. Go to Course Tools → Tests, Surveys, and Pools → Surveys
2. Click Build Survey, enter name and instructions
3. Click Upload Questions on the survey canvas
4. Upload the TXT file (tab-delimited format)
5. Set default point value (ignored for surveys but required)

## Response Rate Targets

Based on research, aim for these benchmarks:
- **Minimum viable**: 50% (usable but limited reliability)
- **Good**: 70% (reliable for most class sizes)
- **Excellent**: 85%+ (high confidence in results)

For classes with fewer than 15 students, aim for 80%+ to ensure adequate reliability.
