## UK Grading System (40% Pass)

**Standard UK university classification:**

| Classification | First Class | Upper Second (2:1) | Lower Second (2:2) | Third Class | Pass | Fail |

| **%** | 70-100 | 60-69 | 50-59 | 40-49 | 40-49 | < 40 |

**Characteristics:**
- Pass threshold: 40%
- First Class (70%+) is highest honor (difficult to achieve)
- Upper Second 2:1 (60-69%) is strong performance
- Lower Second 2:2 (50-59%) is satisfactory
- Third Class (40-49%) is minimum pass

**Common in:**
- UK universities
- Commonwealth countries (Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore)
- Some European universities

**Note:** In UK system, grades above 80% are very rare. A 70% is considered excellent work.

## European ECTS System

**ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) grading:**

| ECTS Grade | Definition | % of Students | Typical % Range |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| A | Excellent | Top 10% | 90-100 |
| B | Very Good | Next 25% | 80-89 |
| C | Good | Next 30% | 70-79 |
| D | Satisfactory | Next 25% | 60-69 |
| E | Sufficient (Pass) | Next 10% | 50-59 |
| F/FX | Fail | - | < 50 |

**Characteristics:**
- Pass threshold: 50%
- Relative grading (based on cohort performance)
- C (70-79%) is considered good work
- Common in European universities

## Vietnamese System (With US Scale Adaptation)

**Many Vietnamese universities use adapted US scale:**

| Grade | Xuất Sắc (Excellent) | Giỏi (Very Good) | Khá (Good) | Trung Bình (Average) | Yếu (Weak) | Kém (Fail) |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Letter** | A | B | C | D | E | F |
| **%** | 85-100 | 70-84 | 55-69 | 40-54 | 30-39 | < 30 |
| **4.0 Scale** | 3.6-4.0 | 3.0-3.5 | 2.0-2.9 | 1.0-1.9 | 0.5-0.9 | 0 |

**Alternative Vietnamese Scale:**

| Grade | A | B+ | B | C+ | C | D+ | D | F |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **%** | 90-100 | 85-89 | 80-84 | 75-79 | 70-74 | 65-69 | 60-64 | < 60 |

**Characteristics:**
- Varies by institution
- Some use 4.0 scale, some use 10-point scale
- Pass threshold typically 40-60% depending on institution
- Often adapted from US or French systems

## Quick Comparison

| System | Pass % | Good % | Excellent % | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| **US** | 60% | 80%+ | 90%+ | Higher thresholds |
| **UK** | 40% | 60%+ | 70%+ | Lower thresholds, harder to get high marks |
| **ECTS** | 50% | 70%+ | 90%+ | Relative grading |
| **Vietnamese** | 40-60% | 70-80%+ | 85-90%+ | Institution-dependent |

## Selecting the Right System

### For Andrews University - NEU Campus (Vietnam)

**Likely options:**
1. **US System** (if Andrews is primary awarding institution)
2. **Vietnamese adapted system** (if NEU has specific requirements)
3. **Hybrid** (UK pass threshold 40% with US letter grades)

### Questions to Ask During Syllabus Generation:

1. **"Which grading system does your institution use?"**
   - US (60% pass)
   - UK (40% pass)
   - Vietnamese adapted
   - Other

2. **"What is the pass threshold?"**
   - Verify the exact percentage

3. **"Are there any institutional requirements for grade distribution?"**
   - Some institutions limit % of A grades
   - Some require normal distribution

4. **"Should rubrics reflect the grading scale?"**
   - UK: Rubric "Excellent" = 70%+
   - US: Rubric "Excellent" = 90%+

## Implementation in Syllabus

### US System Example:
```markdown
| Grade | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D- | F |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **%** | 94-100 | 90-93 | 87-89 | 84-86 | 80-83 | 77-79 | 74-76 | 70-73 | 67-69 | 64-66 | 60-63 | < 60 |
```

### UK System Example:
```markdown
| Classification | First Class | Upper Second (2:1) | Lower Second (2:2) | Third Class | Fail |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | ---- |
| **%** | 70-100 | 60-69 | 50-59 | 40-49 | < 40 |
```

### Vietnamese Adapted Example:
```markdown
| Grade | Xuất Sắc | Giỏi | Khá | Trung Bình | Kém |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | --- | ---------- | --- |
| **Letter** | A | B | C | D | F |
| **%** | 85-100 | 70-84 | 55-69 | 40-54 | < 40 |
```

## Rubric Alignment

**Important:** Rubric descriptions must align with grading scale!

### US System Rubric:
- Excellent (94-100%): "Outstanding work, exceeds all expectations"
- Good (84-93%): "Strong work, meets all requirements well"
- Satisfactory (74-83%): "Acceptable work, meets basic requirements"

### UK System Rubric:
- Excellent/First (70-100%): "Outstanding work showing mastery" ← Note: 70%, not 94%!
- Good/2:1 (60-69%): "Strong work demonstrating solid understanding"
- Satisfactory/2:2 (50-59%): "Acceptable work meeting requirements"

## Notes for Vietnamese Context

**Cultural considerations:**
- Vietnamese students familiar with 10-point scale (0-10)
- May need explanation of letter grade system
- UK system (40% pass) may seem "too easy" initially
- US system (60% pass) may seem very strict
- Clear explanation needed in syllabus

**Best practice:**
- Include both percentage AND letter grades
- Provide Vietnamese translations if using Vietnamese scale
- Explain what each grade level means in practice
- Give examples of what work at each level looks like
