## MAIN ACTIVITY: Final Presentation Practice (55-60 minutes)

### Activity Overview

**Objective:** Practice delivering a condensed version of your Final Oral Exam presentation and receive structured peer feedback using rubric criteria to improve your final version.

**Structure:** You'll work in pairs. Each person presents a 7-minute version of their presentation, receives feedback, has time to revise, then shares insights with the full group.

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces anxiety by practicing in safe environment
- Identifies unclear areas before high-stakes exam
- Peer feedback reveals what's compelling vs. confusing
- Speaking out loud shows gaps in your narrative logic
- Builds confidence through repetition

---

### SETUP (5 minutes)

**Instructor instructions:**

1. **Form pairs:**
   - Find a partner (someone you haven't worked with much this semester is ideal)
   - Sit where you can see and hear each other clearly
   - Designate Person A and Person B

2. **Distribute materials:**
   - Peer Feedback Form (see template below)
   - Simplified Rubric (4 criteria)
   - Timer access (phone or shared timer)

3. **Review presentation structure:**

**Recommended 7-minute structure for today's practice:**
- Self-discovery journey (1 minute) - Key insights from assessments
- Values, strengths & vision (1.5 minutes) - Who you are, where you're going
- 1-3-5 year goals (2.5 minutes) - Specific SMART goals and why they matter
- Learning integration (1.5 minutes) - Mentorship, course concepts, experiences
- Implementation & commitment (30 seconds) - How you'll achieve goals

**Note:** Your actual final exam will be 10 minutes, so practice the essentials today and expand later.

---

### ROUND 1: Person A Presents (15 minutes total)

**Person A: Present (7 minutes)**
- Stand up if comfortable (or remain seated if preferred)
- Deliver your development plan presentation
- Use notes if needed (this is practice!)
- Person B: Listen actively, take notes on feedback form

**Person B: Provide Feedback (5 minutes)**

Use the structured feedback template below. Focus on:

**Strengths (2 minutes):**
- What was particularly clear and compelling?
- Which part showed strong self-awareness?
- What made you engaged as a listener?

**Areas for Improvement (2 minutes):**
- What needed more clarity or examples?
- Where did the narrative feel disconnected?
- What would strengthen the presentation?

**Specific Suggestions (1 minute):**
- One concrete action to improve before final exam

**Person A: Take Notes (3 minutes)**
- Write down key feedback points
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Thank your partner

---

### ROUND 2: Person B Presents (15 minutes total)

**Switch roles. Person B presents, Person A provides feedback.**

Follow the same structure:
- Present (7 minutes)
- Feedback (5 minutes)
- Notes (3 minutes)

---

### INDIVIDUAL REVISION (10 minutes)

**Both partners work independently:**

Based on feedback received:
- Identify 2-3 specific areas to strengthen
- Revise your presentation outline or notes
- Add examples where clarity was lacking
- Adjust time allocation if needed
- Note questions to ask instructor

**Guiding questions for revision:**

**Content & Self-Awareness:**
- Did I provide specific examples from self-assessments?
- Is my personal growth journey authentic and compelling?

**Goal Clarity & Strategy:**
- Are my goals truly SMART? (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Did I explain WHY these goals matter to me?

**Integration of Learning:**
- Did I reference mentorship insights specifically?
- Did I connect course frameworks to my development?

**Delivery & Presence:**
- Did I make eye contact? (or look at camera if presenting remotely)
- Was I speaking conversationally, not reading?
- Did I stay within time limit?

---

### GROUP DEBRIEF (10 minutes)

**Instructor facilitates discussion:**

**Question 1:** "What was the most helpful feedback you received?" (5 responses)

**Question 2:** "What aspect of presenting your development plan felt most challenging?" (4 responses)

**Instructor synthesizes common themes:**

**Common strengths observed:**
- [Instructor notes patterns across presentations]
- Example: "Many of you showed strong self-awareness and authentic reflection"

**Common areas needing work:**
- [Instructor notes patterns]
- Example: "Several presentations need more specific SMART goal statements"
- Example: "Integration of mentorship insights could be more explicit"

**Key tips for final presentations:**
- **Tell stories, don't just list facts:** "My MBTI is ENFJ" vs. "Discovering I'm an ENFJ explained why I'm energized by collaborative projects - like when I led our group presentation and felt most alive"
- **Connect the dots explicitly:** Don't assume instructors see connections - say "This goal directly aligns with my VIA strength of creativity"
- **Practice out loud minimum 3 times:** Silent reading doesn't reveal pacing or clarity issues
- **Time yourself:** Going over time will impact your Delivery & Presence score

**Questions for instructor:** Open floor for clarifications about final presentation requirements

## QUIZ PREPARATION (15-20 minutes)

### Practice Questions - Weeks 9-12 Integration

**Instructions:** Answer these 8 questions individually (8 minutes), then we'll review answers together (7 minutes).

---

**Question 1:** What are the two key components of Senge's "personal mastery" discipline?

**A)** Goal setting and achievement tracking
**B)** Personal vision and creative tension
**C)** Self-assessment and mentor feedback
**D)** Time management and productivity

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: B) Personal vision and creative tension**

**Explanation:** Senge's personal mastery includes (1) Personal vision - clarifying who you want to become and what you want to create, and (2) Creative tension - the productive gap between your current reality and your vision that generates energy for growth. The key insight is using this gap as fuel for development rather than feeling frustrated by it.

**Week 12 Lecture Reference:** Slide 6
</details>

---

**Question 2:** According to Pink's Drive theory, intrinsic motivation comes from three elements. Which of the following correctly identifies all three?

**A)** Rewards, Recognition, Promotion
**B)** Salary, Benefits, Security
**C)** Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose
**D)** Achievement, Affiliation, Power

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: C) Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose**

**Explanation:** Daniel Pink's research shows that for complex, creative 21st-century work, intrinsic motivation comes from: (1) Autonomy - desire to direct our own lives, (2) Mastery - urge to get better at something that matters, and (3) Purpose - yearning to serve something larger than ourselves. Traditional external rewards (carrots and sticks) don't effectively motivate complex knowledge work.

**Week 12 Lecture Reference:** Slide 10

**Application:** When evaluating career opportunities, assess whether roles provide opportunities for autonomy, mastery, and purpose. If your career goals don't satisfy these three elements, you'll struggle with sustained motivation over time.
</details>

---

**Question 3:** In the 70-20-10 model of professional development, what does the "70" represent?

**A)** 70% of learning comes from formal courses and certifications
**B)** 70% of learning comes from social learning (mentors and peers)
**C)** 70% of learning comes from experiential learning (on-the-job challenges)
**D)** 70% of learning comes from self-directed reading and research

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: C) 70% of learning comes from experiential learning (on-the-job challenges)**

**Explanation:** The 70-20-10 model (Center for Creative Leadership) shows that most effective learning happens through: 70% Experiential learning (on-the-job challenges, projects, stretch assignments), 20% Social learning (mentors, coaches, peers, feedback), and 10% Formal learning (courses, certifications, structured programs).

**Week 12 Lecture Reference:** Slide 17

**Key Insight:** Don't wait for formal training opportunities to learn. The majority of your professional development will come from the challenges you take on at work. Volunteer for difficult projects, reflect on experiences using frameworks like Gibbs' cycle, and extract learning from every experience.
</details>

---

**Question 4:** What is the main difference between "personal vision" and "goals" in personal mastery?

**A)** Personal vision is short-term; goals are long-term
**B)** Personal vision is about WHO you want to become; goals are WHAT you want to achieve
**C)** Personal vision is external achievements; goals are internal development
**D)** There is no difference - they are the same concept

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: B) Personal vision is about WHO you want to become; goals are WHAT you want to achieve**

**Explanation:** Personal vision is values-driven and focused on internal transformation - the person you aspire to be (relatively stable over time). Goals are results-driven and focused on external accomplishments - specific milestones you want to reach (change as you progress). When goals flow FROM vision, they have deeper meaning and you're more resilient facing obstacles.

**Week 12 Lecture Reference:** Slide 7

**Example:**
- Personal Vision: "I want to be someone who creates positive impact through ethical business leadership"
- Goal: "Get MBA from top-ranked school by 2028"

The goal serves the vision, not the other way around.

**Question 5:** According to Week 12 lecture, what percentage of Vietnamese workers are willing to adapt to new work practices, and what percentage feel overwhelmed by the pace of transformation? (Vietnam context)

**A)** 75% willing; 50% overwhelmed
**B)** 92% willing; 73% overwhelmed
**C)** 85% willing; 60% overwhelmed
**D)** 100% willing; 80% overwhelmed

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: B) 92% willing; 73% overwhelmed**

**Explanation:** PwC's Asia Pacific Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey 2024 found that 92% of Vietnamese workers are willing to adapt to new work practices, BUT 73% feel overwhelmed by the pace of transformation. The key difference between those who thrive and those who struggle is integrating growth into their identity - seeing learning as part of who they are, not just an external demand.

**Question 6:** Which of the following is NOT a component of a sustainable personal learning system?

**A)** Regular learning time blocks scheduled like meetings
**B)** Diverse learning sources (books, courses, mentors, practice, reflection)
**C)** Waiting for employer to provide formal training programs
**D)** Tracking progress and reflecting on application

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: C) Waiting for employer to provide formal training programs**

**Explanation:** A sustainable personal learning system must be self-directed and proactive, not dependent on external structure. Components include: (1) Regular learning time blocks, (2) Diverse learning sources, (3) Tracking and reflection on learning, (4) Application focus (learn → practice → reflect → adjust), and (5) Community connection (learning with others).

**Week 12 Lecture Reference:** Slide 15

**Key Insight:** After graduation, you lose the structured learning environment (weekly topics, assigned readings, instructor guidance). You must build your own system to maintain continuous learning without external accountability. Don't wait for your employer to provide learning - take ownership of your development.
</details>

---

**Question 7:** In the context of personal mastery, what is "creative tension" and how should it be used?

**A)** The stress caused by having too many goals; should be reduced by lowering expectations
**B)** The gap between current reality and personal vision; should be used as energy for growth
**C)** The conflict between work and personal life; should be eliminated through work-life balance
**D)** The anxiety before presentations; should be avoided through better preparation

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: B) The gap between current reality and personal vision; should be used as energy for growth**

**Explanation:** Creative tension is the productive gap between where you are (current reality) and where you want to be (personal vision). People with personal mastery use this tension as FUEL - they ask "What can I learn to bridge this gap?" rather than feeling frustrated or lowering their vision to match current reality. This tension creates energy for development.

**Week 12 Lecture Reference:** Slide 9

**Example:** VinFast's vision in 2017 was to become Vietnam's first global automotive brand, despite having zero car manufacturing experience (current reality). They used this creative tension to hire international experts, build R&D facilities, invest $3.5B, and launch vehicles - transforming their reality toward their vision rather than abandoning the vision.

**Application to your development:** The gap between "who you are today" and "who you want to become" should energize you, not discourage you. That's personal mastery in action.
</details>

---

**Question 8:** According to the lecture, why is reflection the "core practice" of a sustainable learning system?

**A)** Because it's required for academic assignments
**B)** Because without reflection, experience is just "things that happened"; with reflection, experience becomes wisdom
**C)** Because employers require reflective journals
**D)** Because it helps you remember facts for exams

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer: B) Because without reflection, experience is just "things that happened"; with reflection, experience becomes wisdom**

**Explanation:** Reflection is what transforms raw experience into learning and wisdom. Using frameworks like Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (from Week 3), you systematically extract insights from every experience - successes and failures, projects and conversations - and turn them into actionable learning. Without reflection, experiences don't lead to growth.

**Week 12 Lecture Reference:** Slide 18

**Practical Application:**
Build reflection into your routine through:
- Daily reflection (5 min before bed): What went well? What did I learn? What will I do differently?
- Weekly reflection (15 min Friday): Key learnings, how I grew, focus areas for next week
- Monthly reflection (30 min end of month): Progress toward goals, patterns noticed, adjustments needed

**Vietnamese cultural alignment:** This practice aligns with Buddhist traditions of mindfulness and self-examination prevalent in Vietnamese culture - drawing on cultural strengths.

### Quiz Review (7 minutes)

**Instructor leads review:**

- Show correct answers
- Explain key concepts from questions 1, 2, 3, 7 (most critical)
- Address common misconceptions
- Answer clarifying questions

**Key takeaways to emphasize:**

1. **Personal mastery is a lifelong practice**, not a destination
2. **Intrinsic motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose)** more powerful than external rewards
3. **Most learning comes from experience (70%)**, not formal courses (10%)
4. **Reflection transforms experience into wisdom** - make it a daily habit
5. **Creative tension is fuel for growth**, not something to eliminate

**Connection to assessments:**
- These concepts should appear in your Development Plan (especially sustainable learning system)
- Your final presentation should show how you'll maintain growth after course ends
- Integration of these frameworks demonstrates deep course learning (15% of presentation rubric)

---

### Final Thoughts and Questions (3 minutes)

**Instructor closing:**

"This week is critical for your success in this course. The Development Plan (40%) and Final Oral Exam (30%) together make up 70% of your grade.

**Three keys to success:**

1. **Start now:** 8-10 focused hours this week on Development Plan
2. **Be authentic:** Write YOUR story, not what you think we want to hear
3. **Integrate everything:** Show how all course learning connects

**Remember Week 12's core message:**

You're not just completing a course requirement. You're building a foundation for lifelong professional development. The habits and practices you establish now - reflection, continuous learning, values-aligned goal-setting - will serve you throughout your 40-year career.

Personal mastery is not a destination you reach. It's a way of being you cultivate every day.

**Questions?**"
