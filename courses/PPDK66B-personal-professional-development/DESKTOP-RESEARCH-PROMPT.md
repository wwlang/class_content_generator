# Course Research: PPDK66B Personal & Professional Development

## Your Mission

Complete ALL syllabus research for this course by **synthesizing existing 2024 and 2025 materials** and enhancing with new research where needed.

**Important:** You have THREE excellent source documents to work from:
1. **2025 Syllabus** (complete, well-structured)
2. **2025 Assessment Handbook** (detailed rubrics and scenarios)
3. **Manually-created synthesis syllabus** (combines best of 2024/2025)

Your job: Extract the best from these three, validate/enhance readings with research, then output in the standard format.

## EXISTING MATERIALS TO SYNTHESIZE

### Source Files (Read with MCP filesystem tools)

**All source files are in:** `.working/` folder

1. **2025 Syllabus:** `.working/ppd-syllabus-2025.txt`
2. **2025 Assessment Handbook:** `.working/ppd-assessment-handbook-2025.txt`
3. **Synthesis Syllabus:** `.working/synthesis-syllabus-2026.md`

**ACTION:** Use `mcp__filesystem__read_text_file` to read each of these three files before starting research.

## YOUR APPROACH

### Phase 1: Extract Best Course Description & Learning Objectives

**From the three sources above:**
1. Compare course descriptions - which captures the essence best?
2. Extract learning objectives - the synthesis syllabus has 18 well-structured ones
3. Validate against top school standards (M7, UK Triple Crown)
4. **Output:** Recommended 5-8 course-level outcomes + full description

### Phase 2: Extract & Validate Weekly Structure

**The 2025 syllabus has this 12-week structure:**

| Week | Topic | Current Readings |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Introduction & Future of Work | WEF 2025, Clark HBR, Deloitte |
| 2 | Career Skills in AI Era | Schwab, Daugherty & Wilson, Acemoglu |
| 3 | Reflection & Reflective Learning | Gibbs, Kolb, MDPI |
| 4 | Self-Managed Learning | PMC, Waterloo, Zimmerman |
| 5 | Self-Discovery Through Assessment | VIA Institute, Deci & Ryan, Rounds & Su |
| 6 | Field Trip (Experiential) | No readings |
| 7 | Transferable Skills & EI | Goleman, Tushar, Boyatzis |
| 8 | Time, Energy & Habits | Newport, Clear, Schwartz HBR |
| 9 | Growth Mindset & Adaptability | Dweck, PMC, Yeager |
| 10 | Entrepreneurship + Guest Speaker | No readings |
| 11 | Designing Development Plan | Microsoft Learn, Doerr, Locke |
| 12 | Integration & Continuous Growth | Senge, Pink, Kaplan HBR |

**Your task:** For each week, decide:
- ✓ **Keep as-is** (readings are strong - Weeks 3, 7, 8, 9, 12)
- 🔍 **Validate & possibly replace** (readings are placeholders or weak - Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 11)
- ⏭️ **Skip** (no readings needed - Weeks 6, 10 are experiential)

### Phase 3: Research Priority Weeks (5 total)

**Focus your research effort on these 5 weeks:**

1. **Week 1: Future of Work**
   - Validate WEF 2025 report (is it accessible?)
   - Find peer-reviewed alternatives to Deloitte report
   - Vietnam labor market trends article

2. **Week 2: AI Era**
   - Replace Schwab/Daugherty book excerpts with peer-reviewed articles

   - Practical GenAI applications in careers

3. **Week 4: Self-Managed Learning**

   - Find seminal metacognition research
   - Strategic learning frameworks

4. **Week 5: Self-Discovery**
