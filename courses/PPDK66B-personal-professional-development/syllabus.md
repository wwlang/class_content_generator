## Course Description

Personal and Professional Development prepares you to navigate your career with clarity, confidence, and adaptability in an era of rapid technological change. This course recognizes that self-awareness, intentional development, and a growth mindset are essential foundations for lifelong professional success.

As artificial intelligence reshapes the workplace and career paths become increasingly dynamic, the ability to understand yourself, continuously learn, and strategically develop your capabilities has never been more critical. Drawing on research from leading business schools and organizational psychology, this course integrates evidence-based theory with intensive practical application.

You will engage in validated self-assessment tools (MBTI, VIA Character Strengths, CliftonStrengths, Holland Code) to understand your personality, values, motivations, and career preferences. Through reflective writing, experiential learning activities, field experiences, and a structured mentorship program with business professionals, you will develop essential transferable skills including emotional intelligence, strategic thinking, time and energy management, and adaptive learning capabilities.

By the end of this course, you will have created a comprehensive Personal and Professional Development Plan with concrete 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year goals aligned with your authentic values and strengths. You will present your development plan professionally, demonstrating both self-knowledge and communication capabilities. More importantly, you will have established habits of reflection, continuous learning, and intentional development that will serve you throughout your career. This course doesn't just prepare you for your first job—it equips you with the mindset and tools to thrive across a lifetime of professional growth and adaptation.
