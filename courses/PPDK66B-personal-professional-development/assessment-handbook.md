## Tips for Success

### For Reflective Writing

1. **Start immediately after experiences** - Take notes during/after the field trip and guest speaker while memories are fresh
2. **Go beyond description** - Don't just summarize what happened; analyze WHY it matters and HOW it changes your thinking
3. **Be specific** - Use concrete examples instead of vague generalizations ("Ms. Ha Linh said X, which made me realize Y" not "The speaker was inspiring")
4. **Use your framework** - Let Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll structure your thinking; don't just mention it once
5. **Connect to course concepts** - Reference specific frameworks learned (e.g., "Observing MISA's culture helped me understand Goleman's EI competencies...")

### For Mentorship Success

1. **Prepare thoroughly for every meeting** - Submit forms on time; never wing it
2. **Ask deep questions** - Move from surface ("What's your job like?") to substantive ("How do you decide which opportunities to pursue?")
3. **Take notes during meetings** - You'll need specific details for reflection forms and PDP
4. **Follow through on commitments** - If your mentor suggests reading an article or trying something, DO IT
5. **Integrate feedback continuously** - Don't wait until Week 11 to incorporate mentor advice into your PDP

### For Your Personal Development Plan

1. **Start early** - Begin drafting sections as you complete each self-assessment; don't wait until Week 10
2. **Be authentic** - Your plan should reflect YOUR values and goals, not what you think instructors want to hear
3. **Make goals truly SMART** - "Improve public speaking" is vague; "Present at 3 NEU student conferences by July 2026" is SMART
4. **Get mentor review** - Share draft PDP with your mentor in Meeting 4; incorporate feedback before final submission
5. **Proofread meticulously** - This is 40% of your grade; errors undermine your professionalism

### For Oral Exam Excellence

1. **Practice out loud at least 5 times** - Know your content so well you don't need to read slides
2. **Tell your story** - This is YOUR development journey; make it personal and engaging
3. **Design slides visually** - Use images, graphics, minimal text; avoid bullet-point overload
4. **Prepare for Q&A** - Anticipate questions and practice responses
5. **Time yourself religiously** - Going significantly over or under time suggests poor preparation

### General Success Strategies

1. **Attend every class** - Experiential activities (field trip, guest speaker) are mandatory and cannot be made up
2. **Complete self-assessments thoughtfully** - Honest self-assessment leads to better insights and a stronger PDP
3. **Engage with course readings** - The frameworks you learn (Gibbs, SMART goals, growth mindset) are tools for your development
4. **Build relationships** - Your mentor and classmates are valuable networking connections for your career
5. **Embrace the process** - This course is designed to help you gain clarity about your future; invest in it genuinely

### Time Management Recommendations

**Weekly (Weeks 2-11):**
- 1-2 hours: Mentorship preparation/reflection (as needed)
- 1 hour: Working on PDP sections incrementally

**Week 6:**
- Field trip preparation and immediate reflection notes

**Week 10:**
- Guest speaker preparation and immediate reflection notes
- Begin drafting Reflective Essay

**Week 11:**
- Finalize PDP (major deadline)
- Complete Reflective Essay
- Begin oral exam preparation

**Exam Period:**
- Final oral exam practice and delivery

**Key Principle:** Incremental work throughout the semester beats last-minute cramming. Your PDP should evolve as you learn, not be created in Week 11.
