## Activity Breakdown

### Individual Writing (40 min)

**Setup (3 min):**
- Distribute Self-Assessment Worksheet (or display digital link)
- Clarify deliverable: 300-400 words, 3 sections
- Emphasize: This is for YOUR growth - honest reflection, not performance evaluation

**Student Work (40 min):**
- Students work independently on self-assessment
- Circulate to check progress, answer questions
- Watch for students who finish early or struggle to start (see Facilitation Tips)

**Key Messages to Reinforce:**
- "There are no right or wrong answers in self-reflection"
- "Specific examples > generic statements"
- "It's okay to feel uncertain about your future - this is just the starting point"

### Peer Discussion (25 min)

**Pairs Share (15 min):**
- Pair up students (random or self-selected)
- Each partner shares one insight for 5-7 minutes
- Prompt: "Share one thing you discovered about yourself - a strength, a gap, or something that surprised you"

**Optional Small Group Discussion (10 min):**
- Combine pairs into groups of 4
- Discuss: "What common themes emerged? What differences do you notice in how people define career success?"
- This builds comfort for whole-class sharing

**Purpose:**
- Low-stakes practice before whole-class feedback
- Builds psychological safety for Week 1
- Students hear diverse perspectives on career readiness

## Valid Student Approaches

**1. Skills-Focused Approach**
- **What it looks like:** Student systematically lists technical skills (Python, Excel, data analysis) and soft skills (communication, teamwork, time management). Connects each to WEF growing/declining skills data.
- **Why it's valid:** Concrete, evidence-based, aligns with PDP's skills gap analysis requirement
- **How to support:** Encourage student to add WHY these skills matter to their personal vision

**2. Values-Focused Approach**
- **What it looks like:** Student starts with what matters most (work-life balance, creative expression, social impact) before discussing skills. May say "I don't know what job I want, but I know I need autonomy and purpose."
- **Why it's valid:** Self-awareness of values is critical for PDP vision statement; skills can be developed once direction is clear
- **How to support:** Affirm values clarity, then help connect values to skill development (e.g., "If autonomy matters, what skills enable independent work?")

**3. Gap-Focused Approach**
- **What it looks like:** Student primarily identifies weaknesses and areas for development. May use self-critical language: "I lack..." "I'm not good at..." "I need to improve..."
- **Why it's valid:** Awareness of gaps drives growth; honesty is good
- **How to support:** Redirect to also acknowledge strengths. Ask: "What's one thing you're already doing well?" Normalize that everyone has gaps.

**4. Career Path-Focused Approach**
- **What it looks like:** Student has specific 5-year vision (e.g., "Marketing Manager at tech company") and works backward to identify needed skills
- **Why it's valid:** Goal-oriented thinking; clear direction enables strategic skill-building
- **How to support:** Encourage flexibility - "This is your current vision, but it's okay if it evolves." Ask: "What if this path changes? What transferable skills are you building?"

**5. Uncertain/Exploratory Approach**
- **What it looks like:** Student struggles to articulate skills or 5-year vision. May write: "I'm not sure what I'm good at" or "I don't know what I want to do yet."
- **Why it's valid:** Week 1 self-reflection for students who haven't done career planning; uncertainty is normal
- **How to support:** Normalize uncertainty - "That's why we have 11 weeks and 5 self-assessment tools." Provide sentence starters. Ask about past successes: "Think of a time you felt proud of your work - what skills did you use?"

## Cultural Considerations (Vietnamese Students)

### Modesty About Strengths
- **Context:** Vietnamese cultural norm emphasizes humility; students may be reluctant to claim strengths or achievements
- **What you'll see:** Students downplay accomplishments, use qualifiers ("I'm okay at..." "I guess I can..."), or skip strengths section entirely
- **How to respond:**
  - Explicitly give permission: "In this exercise, it's important to acknowledge what you do well. This isn't bragging - it's self-awareness."
  - Frame strengths as evidence: "What have you successfully completed? What have others asked for your help with?"
  - Share your own example to model self-acknowledgment

### Family Expectations vs. Personal Desires
- **Context:** Career choices often influenced by family expectations (doctor, engineer, stable government job); students may feel conflict
- **What you'll see:** Students write about career paths that don't align with their stated values, or struggle to separate "what I should want" from "what I want"
- **How to respond:**
  - Validate both: "It's okay to consider family input AND your personal goals. They're not mutually exclusive."
  - Ask: "What would a career look like that honors both your values and your family's hopes for you?"
  - Emphasize: PDP is YOUR plan - start with honest self-reflection, then integrate external input

### Group Harmony Valued
- **Context:** Vietnamese culture values collective harmony; students may hesitate to share views that differ from peers
- **What you'll see:** Students wait to hear others' responses before sharing, or give "safe" answers that mirror classmates
- **How to respond:**
  - Create safe space: "Everyone's career vision is different - there's no consensus we're trying to reach."
  - Use individual writing BEFORE group discussion to ensure authentic reflection
  - In peer sharing, emphasize "tell your partner something unique to you"

### Looking for "Right Answer"
- **Context:** Education system emphasizes correct answers; students may seek instructor validation
- **What you'll see:** Students ask "Is this right?" or "What should I write?" or look to you for approval
- **How to respond:**
  - Redirect to self-assessment: "What feels true to you? This is about your experience, not an external standard."
  - If student shares, respond with curiosity, not judgment: "That's interesting - what made you realize that about yourself?"
  - Avoid "good" or "bad" language - use "honest," "specific," "thoughtful"

## Common Misconceptions

### 1. "I need to know my exact career path now"
- **What students say:** "I can't complete this because I don't know what job I want in 5 years."
- **Why it's a misconception:** PDP is about self-discovery and skill development, not career commitment. The course uses 5 assessment tools precisely because no one knows themselves fully in Week 1.
- **How to address:** "This is exploration, not a binding contract. Your vision may change after MBTI, CliftonStrengths, and mentor conversations - and that's expected. Write what feels true today."

### 2. "Technical skills are all that matter"
- **What students say:** Focus entirely on coding, software proficiency, data analysis; ignore soft skills or dismiss them as "obvious"
- **Why it's a misconception:** WEF Future of Jobs 2025 lists analytical thinking (#1), creative thinking (#2), and leadership (#5) as top growing skills - all "soft." HBR emphasizes emotional intelligence and adaptability.
- **How to address:** "Look at the WEF data - what's #1? Analytical thinking. #2? Creative thinking. These aren't technical skills. Employers hire for technical skills and fire for lack of soft skills. Both matter."

### 3. "AI will replace most jobs, so why plan?"
- **What students say:** Fatalistic view: "AI will take over, so there's no point in career planning"
- **Why it's a misconception:** Net +78M jobs by 2030; AI augments more than replaces; humans who can work WITH AI thrive
- **How to address:** "AI replaces tasks, not entire jobs. The question isn't 'Will I be replaced?' but 'What skills make me irreplaceable?' Your self-assessment identifies those skills."

### 4. "My current major determines my career"
- **What students say:** "I'm a [major] student, so I have to work in [field]"
- **Why it's a misconception:** Boundaryless careers mean skills transfer across industries; many people work outside their major field
- **How to address:** "Your major teaches you how to think and develop foundational skills. Many successful people work outside their major - Steve Jobs studied calligraphy, Elon Musk studied physics. What transferable skills is your major building?"

### 5. "I should focus only on my weaknesses"
- **What students say:** Entire self-assessment lists gaps and deficiencies; no mention of strengths
- **Why it's a misconception:** CliftonStrengths philosophy (Week 4) emphasizes building on strengths, not fixing weaknesses. Overemphasis on gaps leads to discouragement.
- **How to address:** "Growth mindset includes recognizing what you already do well. You can't build a career only by fixing weaknesses - you need to leverage strengths. What's ONE thing you're already good at?"

## Facilitation Tips

### If Students Finish Early (before 40 min)
- **Check depth:** "You have 300-400 words - is your response detailed enough? Can you add specific examples?"
- **Expand thinking:** "Pick one skill gap you identified - what's the first step to address it? Add that to your reflection."
- **Connect to course concepts:** "Which of HBR's 5 strategies are you already using? Add a sentence about that."
- **Peer discussion early:** If multiple students finish early, allow them to start peer sharing quietly

### If Students Struggle to Start
- **Provide sentence starters:**
  - "One skill I'm confident about is..."
  - "When I think about 5 years from now, I imagine myself..."
  - "A skill gap I need to address is..."
- **Ask guiding questions:**
  - "Think of a project you completed successfully - what skills did you use?"
  - "What do friends or family ask for your help with?"
  - "If you could design your ideal workday 5 years from now, what would it look like?"
- **Refer to resources:** "Look at WEF's growing skills list on Slide 14 - which of these do you have? Which do you need?"

### For Quiet Groups in Peer Discussion
- **Start with written reflection:** If students hesitate to speak, have them write 2-3 bullet points to share first
- **Model sharing:** Share your own example: "When I did this exercise, I realized I was good at X but needed to develop Y..."
- **Use think-pair-share:** Individual thinking → pair discussion → group share (builds confidence progressively)
- **Name the discomfort:** "It's Week 1, we're all getting to know each other. Sharing something about yourself can feel vulnerable - that's normal."

### Energy Check (Week 1 Context)
- **Students may be shy:** First tutorial session, classmates are strangers, self-disclosure feels risky
- **Warm-up strategy:** Start with low-stakes sharing before self-assessment: "Turn to your neighbor - what's one hope you have for this course?" (2 min)
- **Monitor energy:** If room feels tense during individual writing, play quiet background music or allow brief stretch break at 20-min mark
- **Celebrate participation:** When students share in whole-class feedback, thank them genuinely: "Thanks for sharing that - that takes courage in Week 1"

### If Whole-Class Feedback Stalls
- **Use volunteers first:** "Who's willing to share one insight?" (Usually 1-2 brave students start)
- **Then random selection:** "I'm going to randomly call on 3-4 more people - you only need to share 30 seconds"
- **Lower the stakes:** "You don't have to share your deepest insight - just one thing from your reflection"
- **Model vulnerability:** Share your own career uncertainty or skills gap: "When I was a student, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I tried 3 different paths before finding this one."

## Success Indicators for This Session

By the end of the tutorial, students should:
1. Have completed a 300-400 word self-assessment (evidence: collected or saved documents)
2. Identified at least 1 current strength and 1 skill gap (evidence: peer discussion observations)
3. Articulated a preliminary 5-year vision (evidence: class feedback shares)
4. Connected self-reflection to course concepts (evidence: references to WEF/HBR in writing)
5. Feel safe participating in future tutorials (evidence: voluntary sharing, engaged body language)

**Red flags to address:**
- Student writes <150 words (too brief, surface-level)
- Student copies lecture slides verbatim (not personal reflection)
- Student expresses complete certainty about career path (may need encouragement to stay open)
- Student expresses hopelessness about AI/job market (need reframing to growth mindset)
