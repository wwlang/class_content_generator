# Week 1 Tutorial: Introduction & Future of Work

## Quick Review

**Key Concepts from Lecture:**
- **AI Impact on Careers:** By 2030, AI will displace 92M jobs but create 170M new ones (net +78M). The challenge is skills evolution, not job elimination.
- **Skills Evolution:** WEF identifies growing skills (analytical thinking, creative thinking, AI/big data, leadership) and declining skills (manual dexterity, memory tasks, reading/writing/math in traditional forms).
- **Vietnam Labor Market:** 70% of Vietnamese jobs at risk of automation; youth unemployment at 7.5% signals skills mismatch between education and employer needs.
- **Career Frameworks:** Boundaryless careers, protean careers, and portfolio careers replace traditional linear paths. Career success = personal definition, not societal template.

**What Good Work Looks Like:**
Your Personal Development Plan (PDP) will be assessed on:
- **Self-Assessment Integration (20%):** Complete analysis using multiple tools, deep personal insights, synthesis across assessments
- **Vision & SMART Goals (30%):** Clear 50-word vision statement, 6 specific SMART goals linked to your values
- **Implementation Plan (10%):** Realistic action steps with accountability mechanisms

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Section 3: Personal Development Plan

## Main Activity: Career Future Self-Assessment

**Assessment Connection:** Personal Development Plan (40%, Due Week 11) - this activity begins your self-discovery journey

**The Task:**
Complete a structured self-reflection on your current career readiness and future aspirations. This forms the foundation for your PDP, which you'll develop throughout the course using formal self-assessment tools (MBTI, CliftonStrengths, etc.) and mentor feedback.

**Deliverable:**
Written self-assessment (300-400 words) addressing:

1. **Current Strengths:** What skills do you currently have that will remain valuable in the AI era? Consider:
   - Technical skills (software, data analysis, languages)
   - Soft skills (communication, teamwork, problem-solving)
   - Reference HBR's 5 strategies: What are you already doing to future-proof your career?

2. **Skills Gaps:** What skills gaps do you need to address? Consider:
   - WEF's growing skills list (analytical thinking, creative thinking, AI literacy, leadership)
   - Skills employers in your field demand but you haven't developed
   - Be honest and specific - this is for your growth, not performance evaluation

3. **Five-Year Vision:** What does career success look like for you in 5 years?
   - What role or industry excites you?
   - What impact do you want to have?
   - What does work-life integration look like for you?
   - What values must your career fulfill?

**Success Criteria:** (from PDP Rubric - Self-Assessment Integration)
- **Honest, specific self-evaluation** - Avoid generic statements like "I'm a hard worker." Instead: "I've managed 3 group projects and can coordinate timelines effectively."
- **Connection to course concepts** - Reference WEF data, HBR strategies, Vietnam labor market insights from the lecture
- **Clear articulation of personal values and goals** - What matters to YOU, not what you think you "should" say

**Resources:**
- WEF Future of Jobs 2025 key findings (Lecture Slides 12-15)
- HBR 5 Future-Proofing Strategies (Lecture Slides 18-21)
- Self-Assessment Worksheet (provided in class)
- Vietnam Labor Market Analysis (Lecture Slides 25-28)

**Class Feedback:**
At the end of the session, 4-6 students will share one insight from their self-assessment. Be prepared to:
- Share one strength you identified (30 seconds)
- Share one skill gap you want to address (30 seconds)
- Explain what surprised you in this exercise (30 seconds)

⚠️ **Participation:** You must complete the self-assessment to participate in sharing. This is low-stakes practice - there are no "wrong" answers in self-reflection.

**Save Your Work:** Keep this self-assessment. You'll revisit it in Week 3 after completing MBTI and CliftonStrengths, and integrate insights into your final PDP.
