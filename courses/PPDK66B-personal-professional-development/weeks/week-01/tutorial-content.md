## Main Activity: Career Future Self-Assessment (45 minutes)

### Instructions

Write a 300-400 word reflection addressing the prompts below. This is exploratory, not binding—the goal is to begin thinking about your career development systematically.

**Format:** Individual written reflection (save your work—it will inform your PDP in Week 11)

**Time:** 45 minutes of focused writing

### Writing Prompts

**Part 1: Your 2030 Vision (100-150 words)**

It's 2030. You've been working for 5 years since graduation. Describe your ideal professional situation:
- What role or position do you hold?
- What industry or sector are you in?
- What does a typical workday look like?
- What skills are you using daily?
- What impact are you making?

Be specific. Instead of "working in business," write "leading sustainability initiatives for a Vietnamese tech startup expanding into Southeast Asia."

**Part 2: Skills Gap Analysis (100-150 words)**

Looking at the WEF Skills Framework from today's lecture:
- Which 2-3 skills are your current strengths? Provide brief evidence (e.g., "Analytical thinking—I excelled in data analysis coursework and enjoy breaking down complex problems").
- Which 2-3 skills represent gaps you need to develop? Be honest about areas where you feel less confident.
- How does your skills profile match or mismatch your 2030 vision from Part 1?

**Part 3: One Semester Commitment (100 words)**

Based on your vision and skills analysis:
- Choose ONE skill from Clark's five strategies OR the WEF framework to develop this semester
- Explain why this skill matters for your 2030 vision
- Identify one concrete action you'll take in the next 30 days to start developing it

Example: "I'll develop AI Collaboration by experimenting with ChatGPT for research synthesis in my assignments, learning its strengths and limitations through hands-on use. First step: Use it for Week 2's assignment and reflect on what it did well vs. where my judgment was needed."

## Pair-and-Share Discussion (20 minutes)

### Instructions

1. **Find a partner** (tutor will facilitate pairing if needed)

2. **Take turns sharing** (7 minutes each):
   - Your 2030 vision (1-2 sentences)
   - The one skill you're committing to develop and why
   - What you're most excited OR anxious about regarding the future of work

3. **Offer feedback** (3 minutes per person):
   - One strength you see in their plan
   - One question to help them think deeper
   - One resource or idea you can share

4. **Record insights** (3 minutes):
   - Note anything your partner said that shifted your thinking
   - Write down any new ideas for your own development

### Discussion Tips

- Listen actively—ask follow-up questions rather than waiting to talk
- Be supportive AND honest—vague praise isn't helpful
- Focus on possibilities, not limitations
- Respect confidentiality—what's shared in pairs stays in pairs
