## Activity 1: Icebreaker—Two Truths and a Career Dream (15 minutes)

### Purpose
Build classroom community, establish a safe environment for sharing, and begin thinking about career aspirations.

### Instructions

**Individual Preparation (3 minutes):**

On a piece of paper or in your notes, write:
- **Two truths about yourself** (these can be anything—hobbies, background, experiences, quirks)
- **One career dream** (a job, industry, accomplishment, or professional identity you aspire to—can be ambitious, uncertain, or still forming)

**Examples:**
- *Truth 1:* I've traveled to 5 countries
- *Truth 2:* I'm terrified of public speaking
- *Career Dream:* I want to start a sustainable fashion business in Vietnam

**Small Groups (10 minutes):**

Form groups of 4-5 students. Go around the circle:
1. Share your two truths and career dream
2. Others in the group can ask one clarifying question about your career dream (e.g., "What draws you to that industry?" or "What's the first step you'd take toward that goal?")
3. Move to the next person

**Whole-Class Debrief (2 minutes):**

Instructor asks: "What did you notice about the career dreams in your group? Any patterns? Surprises?"

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor says:**

"You've just done what many people never do—articulated a career aspiration out loud. Notice how it feels different to say it versus just thinking it. Throughout this course, we'll help you move from vague dreams to concrete, strategic plans. But first, we need to understand the landscape you're entering."

## Activity 2: The AI Era—Fears, Hopes, and Realities (20 minutes)

### Purpose
Process the lecture content about future of work; surface students' authentic emotional responses to technological change; build collective understanding of both threats and opportunities.

### Setup

**Instructor creates three posters/sections on the board:**
1. **FEARS** (What worries you about AI and the future of work?)
2. **HOPES** (What excites you or gives you optimism?)
3. **REALITIES** (What do we actually know based on research?)

### Part A: Individual Reflection (5 minutes)

**Prompt:**

"Take 5 minutes to write freely about your relationship with AI and career uncertainty. Consider:

- What worries you most about competing with AI or automation?
- What opportunities do you see in the changing job market?
- How prepared do you feel right now for the future of work described in today's lecture?
- What skills do you think you need to develop most urgently?

Be honest. This is for your own reflection."

**Students write silently.**

### Part B: Small Group Discussion (10 minutes)

**Form groups of 4-5 students.**

**Discussion prompts:**

1. **Share one fear from your reflection.** Do others in your group share this concern? (3 minutes)

2. **Share one hope or opportunity you see.** How could you position yourself to benefit from technological change rather than be threatened by it? (3 minutes)

3. **Based on today's lecture, what's one concrete action you could take *this semester* to better prepare for the AI era?** (4 minutes)

**Instructor circulates, listening to discussions and noting common themes.**

### Part C: Whole-Class Synthesis (5 minutes)

**Instructor facilitates:**

"Let's capture what we've discussed."

**Ask groups to share:**
- One common fear (write on FEARS poster)
- One common hope (write on HOPES poster)

**Then, instructor connects to lecture content (REALITIES):**

"Here's what research tells us (point to lecture content):
- **Reality 1:** Jobs are changing, not disappearing (net +78 million by 2030)
- **Reality 2:** The skills that matter are uniquely human—creativity, empathy, judgment, relationships
- **Reality 3:** Your advantage comes from *continuous development*, not static knowledge
- **Reality 4:** Vietnam's skills gap is your opportunity—cognitive and behavioral skills are in high demand"

**Closing reflection:**

"Your fears are valid. But they're also solvable—through the work we'll do in this course. Keep these in mind as we move through the semester."

---

## Activity 3: Skills Self-Assessment—Where Are You Now? (20 minutes)

### Purpose
Establish a baseline understanding of current competencies; identify development priorities; introduce the concept of skills gap analysis.

### Instructions

**Instructor distributes handout** (or students use their notebooks):

### Personal Skills Inventory

**Rate yourself honestly on a scale of 1-5:**
- **1 = Not developed** (I struggle with this significantly)
- **2 = Developing** (I'm aware of the need but haven't made much progress)
- **3 = Competent** (I can do this adequately in most situations)
- **4 = Strong** (I do this well and consistently)
- **5 = Expert** (This is a signature strength; I excel here)

#### Part A: Future-of-Work Skills (from WEF Top 10)

| Skill | Current Level (1-5) | Target Level (1-5) | Priority (Low/Med/High) |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|

### Individual Work (12 minutes)

**Students complete the self-assessment.**

**After rating current levels, students:**
1. **Set target levels** (Where do you want/need to be in each skill?)
2. **Mark priorities** (Which gaps are most urgent to address?)

### Pair-Share Discussion (8 minutes)

**Find a partner. Discuss:**

1. **Which skill surprised you?** (Either you rated yourself higher or lower than you expected) (2 minutes)

2. **What are your top 3 priority skills to develop?** Why these three? (3 minutes)

3. **How could this course help you develop these skills?** Think about the assessments, mentorship, reflective essay, and PDP. (3 minutes)

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor says:**

"What you just completed is the foundation of a **skills gap analysis**—a core component of your Personal Development Plan (40% of your grade).

**Current level** = Where you are today
**Target level** = Where you need to be for your career goals
**Gap** = What you need to develop
**Priority** = What to focus on first

This isn't about judging yourself harshly. It's about *strategic awareness*. You can't close a gap you haven't identified. Now you know where to focus."

**Save this assessment.** You'll revisit and refine it when creating your PDP in Week 11.

## Activity 4: Career Vision Brainstorming—The 5-Year Snapshot (15 minutes)

### Purpose
Begin thinking about long-term career direction; introduce the concept of vision-driven planning; preview the Personal Development Plan vision statement.

### Instructions

**Instructor introduces the activity:**

"In Week 11, you'll write a 50-word vision statement for your Personal Development Plan. Today, we're starting to gather the raw material for that vision.

I want you to imagine it's **5 years from now—2030**. You've graduated, worked for a few years, developed new skills, and made strategic career choices.

**Visualize a typical day in your professional life.**"

### Individual Visualization Exercise (10 minutes)

**Instructor guides students through a reflective visualization (slow pace, pauses between questions):**

"Close your eyes or focus on your paper. Imagine waking up on a typical workday in 2030.

**Think about:**

- Where are you waking up? (Hanoi? Abroad? Remote work from anywhere?)
- What industry are you working in?
- What's your job title or role?
- What kind of work are you doing on a typical day? (Meetings? Analysis? Creative work? Managing people?)
- Who are you working with? (A team? Independently? With international colleagues?)
- What skills are you using most often?
- What problems are you solving?
- What impact is your work having? (On customers? On society? On Vietnam's economy?)
- How do you feel at the end of your workday? (Energized? Fulfilled? Proud?)
- What are people saying about you professionally? (What's your reputation?)

**Now open your eyes.**"

**Write for 5 minutes: Describe this day. Don't worry about being realistic or practical yet—just capture the vision.**

### Pair-Share (5 minutes)

**Turn to a partner and share:**

1. **One specific detail from your 5-year vision** (e.g., "I'm leading a digital marketing team for a Vietnamese e-commerce startup")
2. **What would need to happen between now and then to make this vision real?** (Skills? Experiences? Networks? Opportunities?)

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor says:**

"Many of you have never done this exercise before—deliberately envisioning your professional future in concrete detail.

Here's why it matters: **Research shows that people with clear, specific visions are more likely to achieve their goals.** Why? Because vision drives decisions.

- When you're choosing electives, your vision guides you
- When you're evaluating internship offers, your vision guides you
- When you're deciding how to spend your time, your vision guides you

**Without vision, you make reactive decisions based on what feels easy or familiar. With vision, you make strategic decisions aligned with where you want to go.**

We'll refine this vision throughout the semester using self-assessment insights, mentor guidance, and strategic planning frameworks. But now you have a starting point."

## Activity 5: Mentorship Program Orientation (15 minutes)

### Purpose
Explain the mentorship program structure, expectations, and value; prepare students for their first mentor meeting; address questions and concerns.

### Part A: Program Overview (7 minutes)

**Instructor presents:**

**What is the Mentorship Program?**

- **10-week program** (September 23 - November 30, 2025)
- **One-on-one pairing** with an experienced business professional from ISME (Institute of Small and Medium Enterprise Development)
- **Minimum 4 meetings** (at least 2 must be face-to-face)
- **Focus areas:** Marketing, personal management, or career orientation
- **Worth 20% of your final grade**

**Why does this matter?**

Research consistently shows professionals with mentors:
- Advance faster in their careers (promotions come sooner)
- Earn higher salaries (5-20% more on average)
- Report greater job satisfaction
- Build stronger professional networks
- Navigate career transitions more successfully

**Mentorship isn't a magic solution—it's a structured relationship where you:**
- Learn from someone with more experience
- Get honest feedback on your strengths and development areas
- Gain insider knowledge about industries and career paths
- Build a professional relationship that can continue after this course

**What makes a good mentee?**

1. **Preparation:** Come to each meeting with clear objectives and thoughtful questions
2. **Active listening:** Take notes; ask follow-up questions; show genuine interest
3. **Follow-through:** If your mentor suggests reading an article or trying something, DO IT
4. **Reflection:** Don't just collect advice—think deeply about how to apply it
5. **Professionalism:** Be punctual, respectful, and appreciative of their time
6. **Integration:** Incorporate mentor feedback into your Personal Development Plan

### Part B: Meeting Requirements and Documentation (5 minutes)

**Instructor explains:**

**For each of your 4 meetings, you must submit:**

**1. Pre-Meeting Preparation Form (due 48 hours before meeting)**

This form includes:
- Meeting objectives: What do you want to accomplish?
- Prepared questions (minimum 3-5)
- Updates since last meeting
- Self-assessment insights or challenges to discuss
- Relevant course content to explore with mentor

**Why 48 hours before?** Your tutor or instructor may review these and suggest additional questions or focus areas.

**2. Post-Meeting Reflection Form (due 48 hours after meeting)**

This form includes:
- Meeting summary: What was discussed?
- Key insights gained
- Advice received and how you will apply it
- Action items with specific deadlines
- Reflections on your professional development progress
- Questions or topics for next meeting

**Why 48 hours after?** Reflection is most effective when the experience is fresh. Don't wait a week.

**Recommended meeting timeline:**

- **Meeting 1 (Weeks 2-3):** Getting to know each other; share backgrounds; discuss career interests
- **Meeting 2 (Weeks 4-5):** Self-discovery; share assessment results (MBTI, VIA, Holland Code)
- **Meeting 3 (Weeks 7-8):** Skills development; discuss SWOT analysis and preliminary goals
- **Meeting 4 (Weeks 10-11):** PDP review; get feedback on your draft Personal Development Plan

### Part C: Q&A (3 minutes)

**Instructor opens for questions:**

**Common questions and answers:**

**Q: What if I can't meet face-to-face due to location/schedule?**
A: At least 2 of 4 meetings must be face-to-face. The other 2 can be virtual (Zoom, Google Meet). If you have exceptional circumstances, discuss with mentorship coordinators.

**Q: What if my mentor and I don't connect well?**
A: Reach out to mentorship coordinators immediately. We can facilitate a conversation or, if necessary, arrange a different pairing. Don't wait until Week 10.

**Q: How do I schedule meetings?**
A: You and your mentor will coordinate directly. Be proactive—suggest specific times rather than asking "When are you free?"

**Q: What if my mentor cancels a meeting?**
A: Reschedule promptly. Professionals are busy, but they've committed to this program. If cancellations become a pattern, inform coordinators.

**Q: Can I contact my mentor outside of the 4 required meetings?**
A: Yes, if your mentor is willing! Some mentorship relationships extend beyond the course requirements. But don't abuse their time.

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor says:**

"Your mentor is a gift—they're volunteering their time because they believe in developing the next generation of Vietnamese business professionals.

**Respect their time by being prepared. Honor their advice by taking it seriously. Maximize this opportunity by engaging authentically.**

Mentorship can be a turning point in your career. It's worth the effort."

## Activity 6: Self-Assessment Tools Introduction (10 minutes)

### Purpose
Introduce the five validated self-assessment tools students will complete; explain how each contributes to self-knowledge; provide access information and deadlines.

### Instructions

**Instructor presents:**

**Why Self-Assessment?**

"You can't plan a destination if you don't know your starting point. Career planning without self-knowledge is like navigation without a map—you might get somewhere, but probably not where you wanted to go.

This course uses **5 validated assessment tools** to help you understand:
- Your personality and work preferences
- Your signature strengths
- Your talents and how to leverage them
- Your emotional intelligence competencies
- Your career interest patterns

These aren't pop psychology quizzes—they're research-backed frameworks used by professional career counselors, psychologists, and organizational development experts worldwide."

### The Five Assessment Tools

**Instructor explains each:**

**1. MBTI / 16 Personalities (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)**

- **What it measures:** Personality preferences across 4 dimensions:
  - Extraversion vs. Introversion (energy source)
  - Sensing vs. Intuition (information processing)
  - Thinking vs. Feeling (decision-making)
  - Judging vs. Perceiving (approach to external world)

- **Your result:** One of 16 personality types (e.g., INTJ, ESFP)

- **How it helps:** Understand work environments where you thrive, communication styles, leadership approaches, and potential blind spots

- **Access:** Free version at **16personalities.com**
  - Takes 10-15 minutes
  - **DUE:** Complete before Week 2 tutorial; bring results to class

**2. VIA Character Strengths**

- **What it measures:** 24 character strengths across 6 virtue categories (wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, transcendence)

- **Your result:** Ranked list of strengths; your top 5 are your "signature strengths"

- **How it helps:** Identify what you naturally do well; align career choices with authentic strengths; develop strategies for leveraging strengths

- **Access:** Free at **viacharacter.org**
  - Takes 15-20 minutes
  - **DUE:** Complete by Week 5

**3. CliftonStrengths (formerly StrengthsFinder)**

- **What it measures:** 34 talent themes in 4 domains (Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building, Strategic Thinking)

- **Your result:** Top 5 talent themes (e.g., Strategic, Achiever, Empathy, Learner, Communication)

- **How it helps:** Understand your unique combination of talents; learn how to develop each theme; apply strengths to career success

- **Access:** **Requires access code** (provided in course materials)
  - Takes 30-40 minutes
  - **DUE:** Complete by Week 5

**4. Emotional Intelligence Assessment**

- **What it measures:** Four core EI competencies:
  - Self-awareness (understanding your emotions)
  - Self-management (regulating emotions productively)
  - Social awareness (empathy and organizational understanding)
  - Relationship management (influencing, coaching, conflict resolution)

- **Your result:** Scores across competency areas with development recommendations

- **How it helps:** Identify emotional intelligence strengths and gaps; critical for leadership and teamwork

- **Access:** Assessment link provided in course materials (Week 7)
  - Takes 15-20 minutes
  - **DUE:** Complete by Week 7

**5. Holland Code / RIASEC (Career Interest Inventory)**

- **What it measures:** Career interest patterns across 6 types:
  - **R**ealistic (hands-on, practical)
  - **I**nvestigative (analytical, research)
  - **A**rtistic (creative, expressive)
  - **S**ocial (helping, teaching)
  - **E**nterprising (leading, persuading)
  - **C**onventional (organizing, detail-oriented)

- **Your result:** 3-letter code indicating your top interest areas (e.g., ASE, RIC)

- **How it helps:** Match career fields and roles to your genuine interests; avoid careers that will bore or drain you

- **Access:** Free versions available online (link provided in course materials)
  - Takes 10-15 minutes
  - **DUE:** Complete by Week 5

### Assessment Integration

**Instructor explains:**

"You're not just collecting results—you're building a **comprehensive self-portrait.**

In your Personal Development Plan (40% of grade), you'll:
1. Summarize insights from all 5 assessments
2. Write a 200-300 word **integration statement** identifying patterns across assessments
3. Use these insights to inform your SWOT analysis
4. Align your career goals with your authentic strengths, values, and interests

**These assessments work together:**
- MBTI tells you *how* you prefer to work
- VIA tells you your *values-based* strengths
- CliftonStrengths tells you your *talent-based* strengths
- EI tells you your *interpersonal* competencies
- Holland Code tells you *what kind of work* interests you

**All five together = a rich, multi-dimensional understanding of who you are professionally.**"

### Practical Reminders

**Instructor emphasizes:**

**1. Answer honestly, not aspirationally**

Don't answer how you *wish* you were or how you think you *should* be. Answer based on your actual preferences and behaviors. The point is self-knowledge, not scoring well.

**2. Take assessments when you're not rushed or stressed**

Find a quiet time when you can focus. Your results will be more accurate.

**3. Save your results**

You'll need detailed results for your PDP. Take screenshots, download PDFs, or copy text into a document.

**4. Reflect on results before sharing**

When you get results back, read them carefully. What resonates? What surprises you? What questions do they raise? Bring this reflection to your mentor meetings and class discussions.

**5. Assessments are tools, not labels**

Your MBTI type doesn't define you; it describes your preferences. You can develop skills outside your natural strengths. These tools provide insight, not limits.

---

## Closing Reflection and Next Steps (5 minutes)
