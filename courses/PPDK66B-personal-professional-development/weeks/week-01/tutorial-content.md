## Main Activity: Personal Future-Proofing Assessment & Action Plan (75 minutes)

### Overview

You will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment using the five future-proofing strategies from lecture, then create a concrete action plan for developing your weakest areas during this semester. This work directly feeds into your Personal Development Plan (due Week 11) and provides excellent discussion material for your mentorship meetings.

### Part 1: Self-Assessment - Five Future-Proofing Dimensions (30 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each of the five strategies, rate yourself honestly (1-5 scale) and provide specific evidence. Use the guided questions to think deeply about your current capabilities.

### Part 2: Synthesis & Prioritization (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Calculate Your Future-Proofing Profile**

Transfer your self-ratings:
- Strategy 1 (Avoid Predictability): _____
- Strategy 2 (Build Relationships): _____

**Overall Average:** _____ (sum divided by 5)

**Step 2: Identify Patterns**

*Which strategy is your STRONGEST (highest rating)?*

*Why do you think this is a strength?*

*Which strategy is your WEAKEST (lowest rating)?*

*Why do you think this needs development?*

*Are there themes across multiple strategies? (e.g., comfort with risk, social confidence, technical skills)*

**Step 3: Define Your Top 3 Development Priorities**

Based on your self-assessment, identify your top three development priorities for this semester. Be specific.

**Priority 1:**

**Priority 2:**

**Priority 3:**

### Part 4: Pair Discussion (10 minutes)

**Find a partner and discuss:**

1. **Share your weakest area (5 minutes each):**
   - Which future-proofing strategy is your weakest?
   - What's one action you're committing to this semester?
   - How can your partner support you or hold you accountable?

2. **Peer Feedback:**
   - Does your partner's action plan seem realistic and specific?
   - Can you suggest any additional opportunities they might have missed?
   - How might you check in with each other mid-semester on progress?

**Key Insight to Discuss:**
Most students share similar weaknesses (often originality or networking). You're not alone in needing development. The differentiator is who actually TAKES ACTION to improve.
