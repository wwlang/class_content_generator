# 40%

**of job skills will change by 2030**

*(World Economic Forum, 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
This statistic from the WEF's latest Future of Jobs Report typically surprises students. It means that nearly half of what you learn in university will need to be updated or supplemented within the next 5 years. Common student questions: "Which skills will change?" and "How do we prepare for something we can't predict?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. Analyze how AI and automation are reshaping job markets globally and in Vietnam
2. Identify the skills that future-proof careers in the age of AI
3. Compare Vietnamese labor market trends with global workforce transformations
4. Apply career development frameworks to your personal planning

<speaker-notes>
These objectives align directly with the first assessment—the Personal Development Plan. Students will use today's frameworks to conduct their own skills gap analysis and career visioning in Week 11's submission.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Week Prepares You

**Personal Development Plan (40%, Due Week 11)**
- Today: Learn frameworks for analyzing career trends
- Weeks 2-10: Build skills assessment and development strategies
- Week 11: Submit comprehensive PDP with SWOT analysis and 5-year plan

**Mentorship Program (20%, Starts Week 2)**
- Use today's insights to identify what skills you want to develop through mentorship
- Discuss labor market trends with your mentor

<speaker-notes>
The PDP is the capstone assessment worth 40% of your grade. Everything we do this semester builds toward creating a compelling, research-backed personal development plan. The frameworks introduced today—particularly the WEF skills categories and Clark's five strategies—will appear in your SWOT analysis.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="5" layout="section-break" title="Roadmap">

## Today's Journey

1. **The Future of Work Landscape** (20 min)
   - Global trends and Vietnamese context

2. **Skills That Matter** (20 min)
   - Future-proofing your career

3. **Navigating Your Career** (20 min)
   - Frameworks for personal development

<speaker-notes>
We'll move through three distinct segments today. Each builds on the previous, moving from macro trends to personal application. Plan for brief discussion breaks at each transition.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Segment 1 Introduction">

# Part 1: The Future of Work Landscape

**Understanding the transformation**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to first core segment. This section examines the big picture—what's happening to jobs globally and specifically in Vietnam. Students often feel anxious about AI replacing jobs; this segment provides balanced, data-driven perspective.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" title="The Jobs Equation">

## The WEF Jobs Projection (2025-2030)

**Jobs Created:** 170 million new roles
**Jobs Displaced:** 92 million roles eliminated

**Net Result:** +78 million jobs globally

*But here's the critical point:* The NEW jobs require DIFFERENT skills than the displaced ones.

<speaker-notes>
This is a crucial distinction students often miss: automation creates more jobs than it destroys, but it creates jobs requiring different skills. Someone displaced from routine manufacturing work cannot automatically transition to an AI/ML specialist role without reskilling. This is why the 40% skills change statistic matters so much.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Job Categories">

## Which Jobs Are Growing? Which Are Declining?

**Fastest Growing Roles (2025-2030):**
- AI and Machine Learning Specialists
- Data Analysts and Scientists
- Cybersecurity Professionals
- Sustainability Specialists
- Business Intelligence Analysts

**Declining Roles:**
- Administrative Assistants
- Data Entry Clerks
- Accounting and Payroll Clerks
- Bank Tellers
- Postal Service Workers

<speaker-notes>
Notice the pattern: roles requiring human judgment, creativity, and complex problem-solving are growing. Routine, predictable tasks are being automated. Students studying economics and business should note that even traditionally "safe" roles like accounting clerks are declining—automation doesn't only affect manual labor.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Vietnam's Transformation">

## Vietnam's Labor Market Evolution

**Since Đổi Mới (1986):**
- Agricultural employment: ~70% → <50%
- Manufacturing and services: rapid expansion
- Working-age population: competitive advantage

**Current Skills Gap (World Bank, 2018):**
- Employers struggle to find workers with **cognitive skills** (critical thinking, problem-solving)
- Behavioral skills gap (teamwork, communication, adaptability)
- Only 28.1% of workforce has degrees or certificates
- Over 70% untrained or informally trained

<speaker-notes>
Vietnam's transformation from agricultural to industrial/service economy mirrors global trends but with unique challenges. The cognitive and behavioral skills gap identified by the World Bank aligns with WEF's global findings—employers everywhere need workers who can think critically and collaborate effectively. NEU students have an advantage: you're building these exact skills through your university education.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="The Human Sustainability Gap">

## The Perception Gap Problem

**Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends (2024):**

- 89% of executives say their organization advances human sustainability
- Only 41% of workers agree

**What is "human sustainability"?**
Creating work environments where people can thrive, grow, and maintain wellbeing while performing effectively.

<speaker-notes>
This 48-percentage-point gap reveals a critical disconnect: leaders think they're creating sustainable work environments, but workers don't feel supported. This matters for your career planning because it signals which organizations to seek out—those that actually invest in employee development, not just those that claim to.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Key Insight">

## The Constant: Change Itself

Three mega-trends reshaping work:

1. **Technological disruption** - AI, automation, digital transformation
2. **Demographic shifts** - Aging populations, youth unemployment, migration
3. **Sustainability imperatives** - Climate action, circular economy, green jobs

**Your challenge:** Build skills that remain valuable across all three trends.

<speaker-notes>
Students often ask, "How can I plan for something so uncertain?" This slide reframes the question: instead of predicting which specific jobs will exist in 2030, identify the skills that will be valuable regardless of how these mega-trends play out. Adaptability, critical thinking, and continuous learning are examples of such meta-skills.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2 Introduction">

# Part 2: Skills That Matter

**Future-proofing your career**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to second segment. We've established what's changing in the job market; now we turn to the practical question: what can YOU do about it? This section introduces actionable frameworks for skill development.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="framework" title="Clark's Five Strategies">

## 5 Ways to Future-Proof Your Career

**From Harvard Business Review (Clark & Chamorro-Premuzic, 2023):**

1. **Avoid Predictability** - Don't become a routine worker AI can replace
2. **Build Human Relationships** - Networks matter more in automated world
3. **Develop Soft Skills** - Communication, creativity, empathy
4. **Aim for Originality** - Bring unique perspectives and ideas
5. **Develop AI Collaboration** - Learn to work WITH technology, not against it

<speaker-notes>
This framework is highly practical and directly applicable to student planning. Each strategy has immediate actions students can take. Strategy 5 often generates discussion—many students see AI as a threat, but Clark argues it's a tool to amplify human capabilities. We'll revisit these strategies in the tutorial activity.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Strategy 1: Avoid Predictability">

## Avoid Predictability

**Why it matters:**
If your job follows the same routine every day, it's vulnerable to automation.

**How to apply it:**
- Seek roles with variety and complexity
- Volunteer for projects outside your job description
- Develop multiple skill areas (T-shaped professional)
- Look for problems that require judgment, not just procedures

**Example:** A data analyst who only runs standard reports is vulnerable. One who interprets data, presents insights, and recommends strategy is not.

<speaker-notes>
Students often conflate "unpredictable" with "chaotic." Clarify: this isn't about seeking disorganization, but about building a career where your value comes from judgment and expertise, not routine task completion. The T-shaped professional concept (deep expertise in one area, broad knowledge across many) is worth explaining if students are unfamiliar.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="Strategy 2 & 3: Human Skills">

## Build Relationships & Develop Soft Skills

**Why relationships matter:**
- Trust, empathy, and collaboration can't be automated
- Your network is your net worth
- Jobs come from connections, not job boards (70% of positions never advertised)

**Critical soft skills for AI era:**
- **Communication** - Explaining complex ideas clearly
- **Creativity** - Generating novel solutions
- **Empathy** - Understanding others' perspectives
- **Adaptability** - Thriving in changing environments

<speaker-notes>
The "70% of jobs never advertised" statistic comes from multiple studies and resonates strongly with students. Many Vietnamese students focus heavily on technical skills and undervalue soft skills—this is a cultural pattern the World Bank report highlighted. Emphasize that in Vietnam's evolving economy, these human-centered skills are increasingly what differentiates candidates.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Strategy 4 & 5: Originality and AI">

## Aim for Originality & Collaborate with AI

**Originality:**
- Bring unique cultural perspectives (Vietnam + international business)
- Combine unexpected skill sets (economics + design, business + sustainability)
- Question assumptions others accept

**AI Collaboration:**
- AI handles: Data processing, pattern recognition, routine analysis
- You handle: Strategy, ethics, creativity, stakeholder relationships
- **Together:** Faster insights, better decisions, higher-value work

<speaker-notes>
For NEU students, originality has a specific advantage: you understand both Vietnamese business culture and international frameworks. This bicultural perspective is valuable and increasingly rare. On AI collaboration, students often ask "What tools should I learn?" Point them to Week 2, which covers specific AI literacy skills. The key message here: develop AI as your co-pilot, not your replacement.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="framework" title="WEF Skills Categories">

## The WEF Skills Framework

**Top 10 Core Skills for 2025-2030:**

**Cognitive Skills:**
1. Analytical thinking
2. Creative thinking
3. AI and big data literacy
4. Technological literacy

**Interpersonal Skills:**
5. Leadership and social influence
6. Empathy and active listening

**Self-Management:**
7. Resilience and flexibility
8. Curiosity and lifelong learning
9. Motivation and self-awareness

**Technical Skills:**
10. (Industry-specific variations)

<speaker-notes>
This framework complements Clark's five strategies by categorizing what "future-proof skills" actually means. Notice the balance: cognitive abilities, interpersonal capabilities, and self-management are equally important. Students often focus only on technical skills (category 4); this framework shows that's just 1 of 10 priorities. Connection to assessment: students will self-assess against these 10 skills in their PDP.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Cognitive Skills Deep Dive">

## Analytical vs. Creative Thinking

**Analytical Thinking:**
- Breaking complex problems into components
- Identifying patterns in data
- Systematic evaluation of options
- Evidence-based decision making

**Creative Thinking:**
- Generating novel solutions
- Connecting unrelated concepts
- Challenging existing approaches
- Imagining future possibilities

**Both are learnable.** Both are essential. Neither can be fully automated.

<speaker-notes>
Students sometimes believe creativity is innate and can't be developed. Counter this misconception: creativity is a skill that improves with practice, just like analytical thinking. Research by Robert Sternberg and others shows creativity has learnable components: domain knowledge, thinking skills, and intrinsic motivation. Vietnam's education system traditionally emphasizes analytical over creative thinking, so NEU students may need extra encouragement to develop creative confidence.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="Lifelong Learning Mindset">

## Curiosity and Lifelong Learning

**Why it's #1 on most future skills lists:**
- If 40% of skills change by 2030, you must learn continuously
- Half-life of skills is shrinking (technical skills outdated in 2-5 years)
- Your degree is a foundation, not a finish line

**How to cultivate it:**
- Follow industry trends in your field
- Take online courses regularly (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning)
- Read widely beyond your major
- Seek feedback and actively apply it
- Embrace discomfort of not knowing

<speaker-notes>
The "half-life of skills" concept can be eye-opening: technical skills learned in Year 1 may be outdated by graduation. This isn't discouraging—it's liberating. It means learning HOW to learn is more valuable than memorizing facts. For this course, curiosity shows up in assessment quality: students who research beyond assigned readings produce stronger PDPs.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="section-break" title="Segment 3 Introduction">

# Part 3: Navigating Your Career

**Frameworks for personal development**

<speaker-notes>
Final segment transition. We've covered WHAT is changing and WHICH skills matter. Now: HOW to apply this to your own career planning. This section introduces frameworks students will use throughout the course, particularly in the Personal Development Plan.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="framework" title="Career Development Framework">

## A Framework for Career Planning

**Four Pillars of Personal Development:**

1. **Self-Awareness**
   - Who are you? What are your strengths, values, interests?

2. **Market Awareness**
   - What does the world need? Where are opportunities?

3. **Skills Development**
   - How do you bridge the gap between current and needed skills?

4. **Strategic Action**
   - What concrete steps will you take, and when?

<speaker-notes>
This four-pillar framework structures the entire PDP assessment. Self-awareness (pillar 1) comes from personality assessments and reflection exercises in Weeks 3-5. Market awareness (pillar 2) is what we're building today with labor market data. Skills development (pillar 3) spans Weeks 2, 7, 8. Strategic action (pillar 4) culminates in Week 11's final plan. Students appreciate seeing the big picture—how all weekly topics connect.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Self-Awareness Tools">

## Self-Awareness: Know Yourself First

**Key questions to answer:**
- What energizes me? What drains me?
- What am I naturally good at?
- What do I value in work? (autonomy, impact, security, creativity?)
- What are my blind spots?

**Tools we'll use in this course:**
- Personality assessments (Week 5)
- Strengths inventories (Week 7)
- Reflective journaling (Weeks 3-4)
- 360-degree feedback (from mentor)

<speaker-notes>
Many students rush to "what career should I pursue?" without answering "who am I?" first. Self-awareness is foundational—you can't plan a satisfying career without understanding what satisfaction means to you. Week 5 covers formal assessment tools; today's tutorial activity begins the reflection process informally.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Market Awareness in Practice">

## Market Awareness: Understand Opportunities

**How to build market intelligence:**

1. **Research sectors:** Which industries are growing in Vietnam?
   - Technology/IT, financial services, e-commerce, green energy

2. **Track job postings:** What skills do employers actually request?
   - LinkedIn, VietnamWorks, CareerBuilder Vietnam

3. **Informational interviews:** Talk to people in roles you find interesting
   - Your mentor (Weeks 2-10) is a great starting point

4. **Follow trends:** Read industry reports like WEF, Deloitte, McKinsey

<speaker-notes>
Students often rely solely on university career counselors or family advice for market information. Encourage direct research: spending 30 minutes weekly reading job postings in your target field reveals exactly what skills employers value. The mentorship program (starting Week 2) provides insider perspective you can't get from reports.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="framework" title="Skills Gap Analysis">

## Skills Development: Bridge the Gap

**SWOT Analysis for Career Planning:**

| Current State | Future State |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Strengths** - What skills do you already have? | **Opportunities** - What skills does the market value? |
| **Weaknesses** - Where are your gaps? | **Threats** - What could prevent your success? |

**The Gap:** The difference between your strengths and market opportunities.

**Your PDP:** The plan to close that gap.

<speaker-notes>
SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool borrowed from business strategy and applied to personal development. Students will create a detailed SWOT as part of their PDP. Today's lecture provides the "Opportunities" (market trends, valued skills); Weeks 3-7 help identify "Strengths" and "Weaknesses"; Week 11 synthesizes everything into a comprehensive plan.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Strategic Action Planning">

## Strategic Action: Make It Real

**Elements of an effective development plan:**

1. **Specific goals** - "Improve communication" → "Deliver 3 presentations this semester"
2. **Measurable milestones** - How will you know you've succeeded?
3. **Realistic timeline** - What can you actually accomplish?
4. **Accountability** - Who will support and check your progress?
5. **Flexibility** - How will you adapt when circumstances change?

**This semester:** You'll build this plan step by step, week by week.

<speaker-notes>
Students often create vague goals like "be more confident" or "learn more." Push for specificity: what does "confident" look like behaviorally? How would you measure it? The mentorship program provides built-in accountability (pillar 4). Emphasize that a development plan isn't a rigid contract—it's a living document that evolves as you learn more about yourself and the market.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="Your 5-Year Vision">

## Looking Ahead: Your Career in 2030

**Reflection questions for today's tutorial:**

- In 5 years (2030), what role do you envision yourself in?
- Which of Clark's 5 strategies resonates most with you? Why?
- Looking at the WEF skills framework, where are your strengths? Your gaps?
- What one skill will you commit to developing this semester?

**Remember:** Plans change. Starting with a vision gives you direction.

<speaker-notes>
The 2030 timeframe is intentional—it aligns with WEF's projections and gives students a concrete time horizon. Many students find 5-year visioning intimidating ("I don't know what I want!"). Reassure them: this is exploratory, not binding. The value is in the reflection process, not in predicting the future perfectly. Tutorial activity provides structured time for this thinking.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="section-break" title="Wrap-up">

# Key Takeaways

<speaker-notes>
Transition to closing segment. Summarize the main insights from all three parts before previewing assessments and next steps.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="28" title="Today's Key Takeaways">

## What to Remember from Today

1. **40% of skills will change by 2030** - Continuous learning isn't optional
2. **Vietnam's skills gap mirrors global trends** - Cognitive and behavioral skills are in demand
3. **Five strategies future-proof careers** - Avoid predictability, build relationships, develop soft skills, aim for originality, collaborate with AI
4. **Career planning has four pillars** - Self-awareness, market awareness, skills development, strategic action
5. **Your PDP starts now** - Every week builds toward Week 11's submission

<speaker-notes>
These five takeaways map to the learning objectives from slide 3. Students should be able to explain each point if asked. Emphasize that today's lecture is foundational—these frameworks will reappear throughout the course, so understanding them now makes future content easier.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Tutorial Preview">

## Tutorial Activity: Career Future Self-Assessment

**Today's tutorial (90 minutes):**

1. Quick review of lecture frameworks (15 min)
2. Individual reflection and writing (45 min)
   - 5-year career vision
   - Skills gap self-assessment
   - One semester commitment
3. Pair-and-share discussion (20 min)
4. Wrap-up and next steps (10 min)

**Bring:** Laptop or notebook for writing

<speaker-notes>
Students often ask if tutorial attendance is mandatory. Clarify your institution's policy. The tutorial activity feeds directly into their eventual PDP—students who engage deeply today will have easier time drafting their assessment later. Writing in tutorial ensures everyone completes the reflection, not just those who would do it independently.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="30" title="Before Next Class">

## Before Next Class
