# Week 1: Introduction & Future of Work

## Lecture Content

<slide number="1" layout="title" title="Introduction & Future of Work">

**Speaker Notes:**
Welcome to Personal and Professional Development! This course is different from many others you'll take at NEU because it's fundamentally about YOU - your values, your strengths, your career goals, and your development as a professional. Over the next 12 weeks, we'll use evidence-based frameworks to help you understand yourself deeply and design a strategic career plan. Today we begin by examining the context you're entering: What does the future of work look like? How is AI transforming careers? What skills will matter most? And critically for you as NEU students: What does this mean for your careers in Vietnam? Let's begin this journey together.

<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="40%">
**of job skills will change by 2030**

World Economic Forum, 2025

**Speaker Notes:**
Let me start with a statistic that should get your attention: The World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects that 40% of job skills will change by 2030. That's just five years from now. Think about that - nearly half of what you'll need to succeed in your career either doesn't exist yet or will be fundamentally transformed. This isn't meant to scare you. It's meant to prepare you. The students who thrive in this environment won't be those with the most technical knowledge today, but those who develop adaptability, self-awareness, and continuous learning habits. That's exactly what this course is designed to build.

</slide>

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Today's Learning Objectives">

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Analyze how AI and automation are reshaping the workplace and career opportunities globally and in Vietnam
- Identify which human skills become MORE valuable as AI capabilities expand
- Apply future-proofing strategies to your own career planning
- Connect course assessments to your personal career development goals

**Speaker Notes:**
Here are our learning objectives for today. Notice that we're not just learning ABOUT the future of work - we're connecting it to YOUR career. Everything we study in this course has immediate practical application. The frameworks you learn won't just be for exams; they're tools you'll use throughout your career. Today specifically, we want you to understand the landscape you're entering and begin thinking strategically about how to position yourself for success. By the end of class, you should have clarity on how this course will help you navigate an AI-transformed workplace.

</slide>

<slide number="4" layout="content" title="Connection to Your Assessments">

**How Today's Content Connects to Your Success:**

- **Personal Development Plan (40%)**: Use future of work insights in your SWOT analysis external opportunities and threats
- **Mentorship Program (20%)**: Discuss AI-era skills and career positioning with your mentor
- **Reflective Essay (10%)**: Connect field trip observations to future workplace trends
- **Final Oral Exam (30%)**: Demonstrate how your goals align with labor market realities

**Speaker Notes:**
Before we dive into content, I want to make something explicit: Everything we cover today will directly support your assessed work. When you create your Personal Development Plan - which is 40% of your grade - you'll conduct a SWOT analysis. Today's content will help you identify external opportunities like growing sectors in Vietnam and threats like automation risk. When you meet with your mentor, you can discuss how to develop AI-era skills. The field trip to MISA Company will be more meaningful when you understand workplace transformation trends. And in your final oral exam, you'll need to show that your 5-year career goals are grounded in labor market realities, not fantasy. This isn't theoretical content - it's strategic intelligence for your career.

</slide>

<slide number="5" layout="content" title="Course Roadmap">

**Your 12-Week Development Journey:**

- **Weeks 1-2**: Understanding the changing workplace
- **Weeks 3-4**: Building reflective and self-managed learning skills
- **Week 5**: Deep self-discovery through assessments (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, Holland Code)
- **Weeks 6-7**: Experiential learning (field trip) + transferable skills
- **Weeks 8-9**: Time management, habits, growth mindset
- **Week 10**: Entrepreneurship and guest speaker
- **Weeks 11-12**: Designing and presenting your development plan

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's where we're going this semester. Think of this as a logical progression: First we understand the context (today), then we build the foundational skills of reflection and self-managed learning. Week 5 is a pivot point where you'll complete five major self-assessments to understand your personality, strengths, and interests. Then we move into experiential learning with the field trip, develop practical skills like time management and resilience, and finally integrate everything into your comprehensive Personal Development Plan. The mentorship program runs parallel to all of this, giving you real-world guidance from experienced professionals. By Week 12, you'll have both self-knowledge AND a strategic roadmap for the next five years.

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="The Changing Workplace">
**Part 1: Global Trends**

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's dive into our first major section: understanding the changing workplace. We'll start with global trends from the World Economic Forum, then zoom into what's happening specifically in Vietnam. The key insight I want you to grasp is that technological change is creating BOTH disruption AND opportunity. The question isn't whether change is happening - it's how you'll position yourself to benefit from it.

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="content" title="WEF Future of Jobs 2025: The Big Picture">

**Survey Scope:** 1,000+ employers representing 14 million workers across 55 economies

**Key Projections to 2030:**
- 170 million NEW jobs created
- 92 million jobs displaced
- **Net result: +78 million jobs**

**Critical Insight:** Technology creates more jobs than it destroys, but they're DIFFERENT jobs requiring DIFFERENT skills.

**Speaker Notes:**
The World Economic Forum released their 2025 Future of Jobs Report in January, and it contains the most comprehensive global data we have. They surveyed over 1,000 employers representing 14 million workers across 55 countries. Here's what they found: Yes, 92 million jobs will be displaced by automation and AI. That's the scary headline you see in news articles. But here's what gets less attention: 170 million NEW jobs will be created. The net result is actually 78 million MORE jobs globally. So this isn't a story of mass unemployment - it's a story of transformation. The jobs being created require different skills than the jobs being displaced. Your challenge, and the focus of this course, is to develop the skills that will be in HIGH demand, not the skills being automated away.

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="content" title="Fastest Growing Roles (2025-2030)">

**Top 10 Emerging Job Titles:**

1. AI and Machine Learning Specialists
2. Sustainability Specialists
3. Business Intelligence Analysts
4. Information Security Analysts
5. Fintech Engineers
6. Data Analysts and Scientists
7. Robotics Engineers
8. Electrotechnology Engineers
9. Agricultural Equipment Operators
10. Digital Transformation Specialists

**Pattern:** Technology + Human Judgment + Specialized Expertise

**Speaker Notes:**
Here are the fastest-growing roles globally according to WEF. Notice some patterns: First, many involve AI and data, but not just technical implementation. Roles like Business Intelligence Analysts require understanding what questions to ask and how to interpret insights - that's human judgment. Second, several are in sustainability and green energy - these are driven by climate change and energy transition, not just technology. Third, notice "Digital Transformation Specialists" - this is about helping organizations CHANGE, which requires communication, change management, and strategic thinking. The pattern here is: Technology PLUS Human Judgment PLUS Specialized Expertise. You don't win just by knowing Python. You win by combining technical literacy with industry knowledge and human skills that AI cannot replicate.

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Skills That Will Matter Most">

**WEF Top 10 Growing Skills:**

**Cognitive Skills:**
- Analytical thinking
- Creative thinking
- AI and big data literacy
- Technological literacy

**Interpersonal Skills:**
- Resilience, flexibility, and agility
- Curiosity and lifelong learning
- Empathy and active listening
- Leadership and social influence

**Technical Skills:**
- Programming and system design
- Cybersecurity and data privacy

**Speaker Notes:**
Now let's look at skills rather than job titles, because skills are more portable across roles. WEF identifies analytical thinking and creative thinking as the top two skills. Notice these are fundamentally HUMAN cognitive capabilities. AI can process data, but deciding what analysis matters requires human judgment. AI can generate content, but truly creative thinking - combining ideas in novel ways to solve unprecedented problems - remains human. AI literacy means understanding what AI can and cannot do, when to trust it, when to question it. The interpersonal skills cluster is fascinating: resilience, curiosity, empathy, leadership. These are all deeply human. Why do they matter more in an AI era? Because as routine work gets automated, human work becomes more complex, more collaborative, and more centered on relationships and change management. Technical skills like programming still matter, but notice they're in the minority. The future of work is not just technical - it's deeply human.

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="Skills Declining in Importance">

**What's Being Automated:**
- Manual dexterity and physical strength
- Reading, writing, and mathematics (routine applications)
- Surveying and data recording
- Routine administrative tasks
- Installation, maintenance (routine)
- Information searching and data entry

**Key Insight:** If a task is repetitive, rules-based, and doesn't require contextual judgment, assume it will be automated.

**Speaker Notes:**
Now the flip side: skills declining in importance. Manual dexterity and physical strength have been declining for decades as manufacturing automated - that's not new. But notice "reading, writing, and mathematics" are on this list. Does that mean literacy doesn't matter? No! It means ROUTINE application of these skills is being automated. AI can now write basic reports, do standard calculations, search through massive documents. What it can't do is decide WHICH report to write, WHAT questions to ask, HOW to interpret results in context. So the skill isn't just "writing" - it's "writing persuasively to influence stakeholders" or "writing to synthesize complex ideas." Here's your rule of thumb: If a task is repetitive, rules-based, and doesn't require understanding context or making judgment calls, assume it will be automated. Plan accordingly.

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="section-break" title="Vietnam Labor Market Context">
**Part 2: Your Career Context**

**Speaker Notes:**
Now let's bring this home to Vietnam. Global trends matter, but you need to understand the specific context where most of you will start your careers. Vietnam's labor market has unique characteristics that create both opportunities and challenges. Let's explore what makes Vietnam different and what it means for your career planning.

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Vietnam's Economic Transformation">

**From Agriculture to Services & Industry:**

- **Pre-Đổi Mới (before 1986):** Agricultural economy dominated
- **Post-Đổi Mới (after 1986):** Rapid industrialization and urbanization
- **Today:** Agriculture < 50% of employment (down from ~70%)
- **Current Drivers:** FDI manufacturing, services, digital economy

**Vietnam's Advantage:** Young, large working-age population competing globally

Source: World Bank (Cunningham & Pimhidzai, 2018)

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's start with historical context. Before Đổi Mới reforms in 1986, Vietnam was predominantly agricultural - over 70% of the workforce. Since economic reforms began, Vietnam has rapidly industrialized and urbanized. Today, less than 50% of employment is in agriculture. Manufacturing for export, services, and increasingly the digital economy drive growth. Vietnam's competitive advantage globally is a large, young working-age population. That's YOUR generation. But here's the challenge: rapid transformation means skills gaps emerge quickly. The education system is constantly playing catch-up with what employers need. Understanding these gaps - and filling them strategically - is how you'll differentiate yourself in the labor market.

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="Vietnam Labor Market: Current Snapshot">

**H1 2024 Data (Vietnam Briefing):**

- Total labor force: 52.5 million
- Labor participation rate: 68.6%
- Youth unemployment (15-24): 8.01% (increasing)
- Workers with degrees/certificates: only 28.1%
- Untrained workers: over 70% of labor force
- Average monthly income: 7.5 million VND (~$295 USD)

**What This Means for You:** Having a university degree sets you apart, but you need MORE than just the degree.

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's current data from the first half of 2024. The total labor force is 52.5 million people - that's the competition. Youth unemployment for 15-24 year-olds is just over 8% and increasing. Here's the critical statistic: Only 28.1% of Vietnamese workers have degrees or certificates. Over 70% are untrained. So your NEU degree DOES set you apart - you're in the top 30%. But here's the reality check: you're competing with other educated workers, not the general labor force. And in that educated segment, differentiation matters enormously. Two students with business degrees - one with strong English, proven project management experience, digital skills, and clear personal brand will vastly outperform one with just the degree. This course helps you build that differentiation through self-awareness, strategic skill development, and professional positioning.

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="High-Demand Roles in Vietnam (2024)">

**Most In-Demand Positions:**
- Data Engineers
- AI and Machine Learning Engineers
- Cybersecurity Specialists
- Software Developers
- Digital Marketing Specialists
- Business Analysts
- Supply Chain and Logistics Managers
- Chip Design Engineers (emerging - semiconductor FDI)

**Pattern:** Digital transformation + technical skills + business acumen

**Speaker Notes:**
What specific roles are in high demand in Vietnam right now? Data engineers, AI/ML engineers, and cybersecurity top the list - these mirror global trends. Software developers remain consistently in demand. Digital marketing specialists are needed as Vietnamese businesses expand online. Business analysts who can bridge technical and strategic thinking are valued. Supply chain and logistics management has grown with Vietnam's manufacturing base. And here's something new: chip design engineers are emerging as high-demand due to recent semiconductor foreign direct investment. Notice the pattern: digital transformation is driving demand across sectors. Even if you're not becoming a software engineer, digital literacy and data comfort are essential. Business roles increasingly require technical fluency. That's why this course emphasizes AI-era skills - not to make you programmers, but to prepare you for a workplace where technology and business are inseparable.

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="Skills Gaps: What Vietnamese Employers Need">

**World Bank Employer Survey Findings:**

**Cognitive Skills Gaps:**
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Analytical reasoning
- Complex communication (written and verbal)

**Behavioral Skills Gaps:**
- Teamwork and collaboration
- Leadership and initiative
- Adaptability to change

**Technical Skills:** Generally adequate for entry-level, but need updating constantly

**Your Opportunity:** These gaps represent competitive advantages if YOU develop these skills.

**Speaker Notes:**
Now this is really important: what do Vietnamese employers say they CANNOT find? The World Bank surveyed employers extensively. Technical skills are generally fine for entry-level - universities teach spreadsheets, accounting software, basic analytics. But here's what employers struggle to find: cognitive skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, complex communication. These are THINKING skills. And behavioral skills: teamwork, leadership, adaptability. Why the gap? Traditional Vietnamese education emphasizes knowledge transmission and exam performance, not skill application or collaborative problem-solving. This is your opportunity. The students who actively develop these skills - through projects, leadership roles, mentorship, experiential learning - have disproportionate advantage. That's why we have a field trip to MISA, a guest speaker, and a mentorship program. These aren't extras - they're deliberate skill-building opportunities. Take them seriously.

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="section-break" title="Future-Proofing Your Career">
**Part 3: Strategies for Success in the AI Era**

**Speaker Notes:**
So we've established the context: global technological transformation, Vietnam's specific opportunities and gaps. Now the crucial question: What do YOU do about it? How do you future-proof your career in an age of AI? Let's turn to evidence-based strategies from Harvard Business Review authors Dorie Clark and Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic. They propose five specific approaches. I want you to evaluate each one for your own career planning.

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Strategy 1: Avoid Predictability">

**The Principle:** If your job is predictable, it's automatable.

**What This Means:**
- Seek roles involving novelty, exceptions, and unique situations
- Develop expertise in complex, context-dependent decisions
- Build careers around problems that don't have standard solutions

**Examples:**
- ❌ Data entry → ✓ Data interpretation and strategic recommendations
- ❌ Standard report generation → ✓ Crafting narrative insights for executives
- ❌ Following established procedures → ✓ Designing new processes for new situations

**Speaker Notes:**
Strategy one: Avoid predictability. Here's the logic - if your job can be reduced to a predictable set of steps, AI or automation can learn to do it. So gravitate toward work involving novelty, exceptions, judgment calls, unique situations. Let me give you concrete examples. Data entry is predictable - you're inputting information following rules. That's highly automatable. Data interpretation - looking at numbers and crafting strategic recommendations - requires understanding business context, stakeholder priorities, market dynamics. Much harder to automate. Standard report generation where you fill in templates? Automatable. ChatGPT does this well. But crafting a narrative that synthesizes complex information and tells a compelling story to influence executive decisions? That requires understanding human psychology, organizational politics, strategic priorities. Not automatable. As you think about career paths, ask yourself: Am I doing predictable work, or am I solving unique problems that require contextual judgment?

</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Strategy 2: Build Genuine Human Relationships">

**The Principle:** AI can process information, but humans make decisions based on trust and relationships.

**What This Means:**
- Invest in networking - not transactional, but authentic relationship building
- Develop reputation and personal brand
- Create value through connections and collaboration

**Career Application:**
- Attend industry events and conferences
- Maintain relationships with professors, mentors, colleagues
- Build presence in professional communities (LinkedIn, industry associations)
- Remember: People hire people they know, trust, and like

**Speaker Notes:**
Strategy two: Build genuine human relationships. AI can analyze data about customers, but it cannot build trusted relationships with them. AI can recommend strategies, but humans make final decisions based on trust in other humans. In Vietnamese business culture especially, relationships and trust are foundational. Networking isn't just collecting business cards - it's authentic relationship building over time. Your mentorship program this semester is exactly this: building a genuine professional relationship with someone in industry. The field trip to MISA is a networking opportunity. Guest speakers are networking opportunities. Class discussions where you build relationships with classmates who will be your peers in industry - networking. Start now. Maintain relationships with professors - we become references for jobs. Use LinkedIn professionally. Attend industry events. Build your reputation as someone competent, trustworthy, and collaborative. These relationships compound over your career and become one of your most valuable assets.

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="content" title="Strategy 3: Develop Soft Skills">

**The Principle:** As technical tasks automate, human skills become MORE valuable, not less.

**Critical Soft Skills for AI Era:**
- **Communication:** Translating complex technical information for non-technical audiences
- **Empathy:** Understanding stakeholder needs, perspectives, and motivations
- **Creativity:** Generating novel solutions, not just optimizing existing ones
- **Collaboration:** Working across functions, cultures, and perspectives
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Self-awareness, relationship management, influence

**These will be Week 7 focus - "Transferable Skills & Emotional Intelligence"**

**Speaker Notes:**
Strategy three: Develop soft skills. There's a myth that as the world becomes more technical, soft skills matter less. The opposite is true. As routine technical work gets automated, what's LEFT is inherently more complex, more collaborative, more human-centered. Communication becomes critical - you need to translate technical insights for non-technical executives, or explain business needs to technical teams. Empathy allows you to understand customer needs that aren't explicitly stated, design products people actually want, manage teams effectively. Creativity means generating truly novel solutions, not just optimizing existing processes. Collaboration is essential because complex problems require diverse expertise. And emotional intelligence - self-awareness, managing your emotions, understanding others, building relationships - underpins all of this. We'll spend an entire week on this in Week 7. For now, understand: soft skills are not optional extras. They're core competencies for the AI era. And they're developable through practice and feedback.

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Strategy 4: Aim for Originality">

**The Principle:** AI is excellent at patterns and optimization, weak at genuine innovation.

**What This Means:**
- Don't just follow best practices - create new approaches
- Combine ideas from different domains in novel ways
- Ask "What if we tried something no one's done before?"
- Take calculated risks and learn from failures

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Many students trained to follow established methods
- Competitive advantage comes from those who innovate
- Entrepreneurial mindset (even within companies) matters

**We'll explore this in Week 10 with entrepreneurship focus**

**Speaker Notes:**
Strategy four: Aim for originality. AI is incredibly good at pattern recognition and optimization. Give it data on what's worked before, and it can optimize brilliantly. What AI struggles with is genuine innovation - creating something that doesn't fit existing patterns. This is both challenging and an opportunity for Vietnamese students. The education system often emphasizes following established methods and best practices. That's safe, but it doesn't differentiate you. Competitive advantage comes from asking "What if we tried something completely different?" It comes from combining ideas from different domains - maybe applying a marketing technique from the US to Vietnamese context, or taking a supply chain innovation from manufacturing and applying it to services. This requires comfort with uncertainty and learning from failure. Vietnamese culture can be risk-averse, but entrepreneurial mindset - even within established companies - is increasingly valued. Week 10 focuses on entrepreneurship specifically. Start thinking now: Where can you bring original thinking to problems?

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="Strategy 5: Develop Human-AI Collaboration Skills">

**The Principle:** The future isn't humans OR AI - it's humans AND AI working together.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Context Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts and queries for AI tools
- **Critical Evaluation:** Knowing when to trust AI output and when to question it
- **Complementary Thinking:** Understanding what humans do better than AI (and vice versa)
- **Tool Fluency:** Comfort with AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude

**This is Week 2's entire focus - "Career Skills in the AI Era"**

**Speaker Notes:**
Strategy five, and this is crucial: Develop human-AI collaboration skills. The future of work is not humans replaced BY AI. It's humans working WITH AI. Your value comes from knowing how to leverage AI effectively while providing the judgment and creativity AI lacks. This means several things: First, context engineering - learning how to prompt AI tools effectively. If you ask ChatGPT a vague question, you get mediocre output. If you provide rich context and specific instructions, the output dramatically improves. That's a learnable skill. Second, critical evaluation - knowing when AI is reliable and when it's completely wrong. AI can confidently state false information. You need to verify. Third, complementary thinking - understanding what humans do better than AI so you can focus your effort there. And fourth, tool fluency - you should be comfortable using ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Claude. These are productivity tools like Excel or email. This is SO important that we dedicate all of Week 2 to this topic. Come ready to engage deeply.

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="content" title="Mini-Activity: Your Future-Proofing Strategy (5 minutes)">

**Instructions:**

1. Look at the five strategies again:
   - Avoid predictability
   - Build relationships
   - Develop soft skills
   - Aim for originality
   - Human-AI collaboration

2. **Individual Reflection (3 minutes):**
   - Which strategy is your STRONGEST currently?
   - Which strategy needs MOST development?
   - Write down one specific action you'll take this semester to improve your weakest area

3. **Pair Share (2 minutes):** Discuss with the person next to you

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's pause for a quick activity. I want you to reflect on these five future-proofing strategies personally. Take three minutes individually: Which one is your current strength? Maybe you're naturally good at building relationships, or you're already comfortable with AI tools. Great, acknowledge that. Now which strategy needs the most development? Be honest. Maybe you've avoided originality because it feels risky. Maybe you've underinvested in soft skills because you focused on technical coursework. That's fine - awareness is the first step. Now write down ONE specific action you'll take THIS SEMESTER to develop your weakest area. Make it concrete. Not "improve soft skills" but "present in front of the class at least three times" or "schedule coffee chats with five professionals in my target industry." Three minutes individually, then two minutes to share with the person next to you. Begin now.

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="section-break" title="Your Development Journey Starts Now">
**Part 4: Course Overview & Next Steps**

**Speaker Notes:**
Excellent discussions. What I heard in the room is exactly what I hoped for - honest self-assessment and concrete planning. That's the mindset that will make you successful in this course and in your career. Let's now transition to the practical: How does this course help you develop these capabilities? What exactly are you going to DO over the next 12 weeks?

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="framework" title="How This Course Develops AI-Era Skills">

**Course Components Mapped to Future-Proofing Strategies:**

| Course Element | Skills Developed | Assessment Connection |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Self-Assessments (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, Holland, EI)** | Self-awareness, understanding your unique strengths | PDP (40%), Oral Exam (30%) |
| **Reflective Learning (Weeks 3-4)** | Critical thinking, learning from experience | Reflective Essay (10%) |
| **Mentorship Program (10 weeks)** | Relationship building, professional communication | Mentorship (20%) |
| **Field Trip & Guest Speaker** | Observational learning, networking, originality | Reflective Essay (10%) |
| **Personal Development Plan** | Strategic thinking, goal-setting, self-management | PDP (40%) |

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's how the course architecture connects to future-proofing. Self-assessments develop self-awareness - you can't leverage your strengths if you don't know what they are. This feeds into your Personal Development Plan worth 40% and your oral exam worth 30%. Reflective learning teaches you to extract insights from experience - critical thinking applied to your own development. This supports your reflective essay. The mentorship program is literally relationship building and professional communication with someone in industry - 20% of your grade and invaluable for networking. The field trip to MISA and guest speaker session give you real-world exposure and inspire original thinking about career paths. And the Personal Development Plan is strategic thinking about your own career - it's goal-setting, resource allocation, and self-management practice. Every component is purposeful. This isn't busy work. It's systematic development of the capabilities you need for career success in the AI era.

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Assessment Overview (Quick Preview)">

**Your Four Assessed Components:**

1. **Individual Assignment - Reflective Essay (10%)** - After field trip and guest speaker, write a critical reflection on career preparation insights using Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll framework

2. **Mentorship Program (20%)** - 10 weeks, minimum 4 one-on-one meetings with industry professional, pre/post-meeting reflections

3. **Personal Development Plan (40%)** - Comprehensive career plan integrating all self-assessments, mentor advice, SWOT, SMART goals for 1/3/5 years

4. **Final Oral Exam (30%)** - 15-minute professional presentation of your PDP (10 min presentation + 5 min Q&A)

**Key Insight:** These assessments build on each other. Start early, work incrementally.

**Speaker Notes:**
Quick overview of assessments - we'll go deeper into each one as the semester progresses, but you should understand the big picture now. First, a reflective essay worth 10% that you'll write after the field trip and guest speaker. You'll use one of the reflective frameworks we study in Week 3. Second, the mentorship program running 10 weeks, worth 20%. You'll meet with an industry professional minimum four times and submit preparation and reflection documents. This is experiential learning and networking combined. Third, your Personal Development Plan - the capstone, worth 40%. This integrates everything: self-assessments, mentor advice, your SWOT analysis, your SMART goals. It's due Week 11. Fourth, the final oral exam worth 30%, where you present your PDP professionally. Here's the key insight: these aren't separate tasks. They build on each other. Your mentorship discussions inform your PDP. Your reflective essay practices skills you'll use in PDP reflections. Your oral exam presents work you've already done in the PDP. Work incrementally throughout the semester. Don't wait until Week 10 to start your PDP - you'll integrate insights as you go.

<slide number="26" layout="content" title="Key Takeaways: What You Should Remember">

**Essential Insights from Today:**

1. **40% of job skills will change by 2030** - Adaptability and continuous learning are not optional

2. **Technology creates more jobs than it destroys** - But they require different skills; position yourself strategically

3. **Vietnam's labor market rewards differentiation** - Your degree sets you apart, but you need MORE: soft skills, digital fluency, English, professional experience

4. **Five future-proofing strategies:**
   - Avoid predictability
   - Build genuine relationships
   - Develop soft skills
   - Aim for originality
   - Master human-AI collaboration

5. **This course is your strategic development program** - Engage authentically with self-assessment, mentorship, and reflection to build career readiness

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's synthesize. Here are the key takeaways you should remember from today: First, that 40% statistic. Skills are changing rapidly. Adaptability and continuous learning are not nice-to-have qualities - they're survival requirements. Second, technology creates more jobs than it destroys globally, but the new jobs require different skills. Position yourself to be valuable in the emerging labor market, not the declining one. Third, Vietnam's labor market rewards differentiation among educated workers. Your NEU degree is valuable, but you need to build on it with soft skills, digital fluency, professional experience. Fourth, five specific future-proofing strategies you can implement. We'll explore each one more deeply throughout the course. And fifth, understand that this course is your strategic development program. The more authentically you engage with self-assessments, mentorship, and reflection, the more career-ready you'll be at graduation. This is an investment in yourselves.

2. Read Clark & Chamorro-Premuzic (2023) HBR article - "5 Ways to Future-Proof Your Career in the Age of AI"
3. Explore one AI tool (ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude) - try asking it to help with a school assignment and evaluate the quality

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's what's coming next week: We dive deep into career skills for the AI era. This is intensely practical. We'll learn context engineering - how to craft prompts that get high-quality output from AI tools. We'll explore the critical role of human judgment - AI can generate content, but YOU decide if it's any good, if it's accurate, if it answers the right question. We'll work with actual AI tools hands-on. And we'll discuss the emerging problem of "workslop" - mediocre AI-generated content that looks professional but adds no value. How do you avoid creating workslop in your own work? Before next class, three actions: First, complete the Week 1 quiz on Moodle covering today's content. Second, read the Clark and Chamorro-Premuzic HBR article that we discussed today - read it closely, we'll reference it. Third, actually use an AI tool. Pick ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. Try asking it to help with a school assignment and critically evaluate the quality. Did it help? Did it make mistakes? What did you learn? Come ready to discuss.

<slide number="28" layout="content" title="Before Next Class: Your Action Items">

**Required Actions:**

✓ **Complete Week 1 Quiz on Moodle** (covers future of work concepts, WEF findings, Vietnam labor market, future-proofing strategies)

✓ **Read:** Clark, D., & Chamorro-Premuzic, T. (2023). 5 ways to future-proof your career in the age of AI. *Harvard Business Review.* (Available through library)

✓ **Experiment with AI:** Choose one tool (ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude), use it for a real task, bring observations to class

**Optional (Recommended):**
- Skim WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 (executive summary - first 20 pages)
- Start thinking about career fields that interest you (we'll begin self-assessment work in Week 5)

**Speaker Notes:**
Here are your concrete action items before next class. Three required actions: Complete the Week 1 quiz on Moodle - this covers everything we discussed today including future of work concepts, WEF findings, Vietnam labor market, and the five future-proofing strategies. Take it seriously; it helps you consolidate learning. Second, read the Clark and Chamorro-Premuzic HBR article. We discussed it today but you need to read it in full - it's excellent and you'll reference it in assessments. Third, experiment with AI. Don't just read about AI tools - actually use one. Pick ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. Use it for a real task - maybe help with an assignment for another class, draft an email, summarize a reading. Critically evaluate: Did it help? Did it make mistakes? What surprised you? Bring your observations to class. Optionally, I recommend skimming the WEF Future of Jobs Report executive summary - just the first 20 pages. It's fascinating data and helps with your PDP. Also start thinking generally about career fields that interest you. We begin formal self-assessment in Week 5, but preliminary thinking helps.

<slide number="29" layout="content" title="Questions & Discussion">

**Open Discussion:**
- What surprised you most about today's content?
- What concerns do you have about the changing workplace?
- What opportunities are you most excited about?
- What questions do you have about course assessments?

**Office Hours:** By appointment - email to schedule
**Course Materials:** All on Moodle including slides, readings, assessment handbook

**Remember:** This course is about YOUR development. Engage authentically, ask questions, take advantage of all resources.

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's open for questions and discussion. What surprised you most about what we covered today? The scale of job creation? Vietnam's specific labor market challenges? The emphasis on soft skills? What concerns do you have about entering this changing workplace? Those concerns are valid and we'll address them throughout the course. What opportunities are you excited about? And do you have questions about the course structure or assessments? I'm available by appointment for office hours - just email me. All course materials are on Moodle including these slides, all readings, and the complete assessment handbook. I want to emphasize again: this course is fundamentally about YOUR development. The more authentically you engage - in self-assessments, with your mentor, in reflections, in class discussions - the more valuable it will be. Don't just go through the motions for a grade. Use this as a genuine opportunity to gain clarity about who you are and where you're going. That clarity is worth far more than the credits.
