    topic: "WEF Jobs Projection"

    question: |
      According to the World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs Report, what is the projected net change in global jobs by 2030?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Net gain of 78 million jobs (170 million created minus 92 million displaced)"
        feedback: "Correct! The WEF projects 170 million new jobs created and 92 million displaced, resulting in a net positive of 78 million jobs globally."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Net loss of 78 million jobs (92 million created minus 170 million displaced)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. You have the numbers reversed. The WEF projects more jobs created (170M) than displaced (92M), resulting in net job growth, not loss."

      - key: "C"
        text: "No net change (equal jobs created and displaced)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The WEF projects significantly more jobs created (170M) than displaced (92M), resulting in net growth of 78 million jobs."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Net gain of 262 million jobs (sum of jobs created and displaced)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Net change is calculated by subtracting displaced jobs from created jobs (170M - 92M = 78M), not adding them together."

    general_feedback: |
      The WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 projects that by 2030, <b>automation</b> (the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention) will create 170 million new jobs while displacing 92 million existing jobs. This results in a net gain of 78 million jobs globally. The key insight: technology creates more jobs than it eliminates, but the new jobs require different skills than the displaced ones. See Week 1 slides 7-8.

    topic: "WEF Skills Projection"

    question: |
      What percentage of job skills does the World Economic Forum predict will change by 2030?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "40%"
        feedback: "Correct! The WEF projects that 40% of job skills will change by 2030, meaning nearly half of current skill sets will need updating or replacement."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "25%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The WEF predicts a much higher rate of skills change—40% of job skills will need to evolve by 2030."

      - key: "C"
        text: "60%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While the rate of skills change is significant, the WEF projects 40%, not 60%, of skills will change by 2030."

      - key: "D"
        text: "10%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This underestimates the pace of change. The WEF predicts 40% of job skills will change by 2030."

    general_feedback: |
      The 40% figure means that <b>nearly half</b> (close to 50%) of the skills required for jobs will change within the next 5 years. This rapid transformation is driven by AI, automation, and digital tools. For students, this means <b>continuous learning</b> (ongoing skill development throughout your career) is essential, not optional. Your university degree provides a foundation, but you'll need to update your skills regularly throughout your career. See Week 1 slide 2.

    topic: "Vietnam Labor Market"

    question: |
      According to the World Bank's Vietnam Future Jobs report, what types of skills do Vietnamese employers struggle most to find in workers?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Cognitive skills (critical thinking, problem-solving) and behavioral skills (teamwork, communication)"
        feedback: "Correct! The World Bank identified gaps in both cognitive and behavioral skills as key challenges for Vietnamese employers."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Technical skills (engineering, programming) only"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While technical skills matter, the World Bank highlighted that cognitive skills like critical thinking and behavioral skills like communication are the primary gaps employers report."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Language skills (English proficiency) only"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Language is one component, but the World Bank emphasized broader cognitive skills (problem-solving, critical thinking) and behavioral skills (teamwork, adaptability) as the main gaps."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Manual labor skills (manufacturing, assembly)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. As Vietnam's economy shifts from agriculture to services and manufacturing, the skills gap is in higher-level cognitive and behavioral capabilities, not manual labor."

    general_feedback: |
      The World Bank report found Vietnamese employers struggle to find workers with <b>cognitive skills</b> (mental abilities like critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical reasoning) and <b>behavioral skills</b> (interpersonal abilities like teamwork, communication, and adaptability). This gap exists despite Vietnam's growing educated workforce—universities need to emphasize these skills alongside technical knowledge. NEU students have an advantage by developing both through coursework and programs like this one. See Week 1 slide 9.

    topic: "Clark's Five Strategies"

    question: |
      In Clark and Chamorro-Premuzic's five strategies to future-proof your career, what does "Avoid Predictability" mean?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Seek roles that require judgment and complexity rather than routine, automatable tasks"
        feedback: "Correct! Avoiding predictability means building a career where your value comes from judgment, expertise, and handling complexity—not performing routine tasks AI can replicate."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Change jobs frequently to avoid staying in one position too long"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Avoiding predictability isn't about job-hopping—it's about seeking work that requires human judgment and can't be easily automated, regardless of how long you stay in a role."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Avoid making long-term career plans since the future is uncertain"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This strategy is about the type of work you do (complex vs. routine), not whether you should plan ahead. Career planning remains important."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Work in unstable industries to develop resilience"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The strategy focuses on doing work that requires human judgment rather than routine execution, not on choosing unstable industries."

    general_feedback: |
      <b>Avoid Predictability</b> means seeking work that is <b>complex</b> (involves multiple factors and requires judgment) rather than <b>routine</b> (follows the same steps every time). If your job consists of <b>repetitive</b> (same tasks done repeatedly) and <b>predictable</b> (outcomes can be anticipated) tasks, AI can likely automate it. Build a career around problems requiring human judgment, creativity, and adaptability. Example: A data analyst who only runs standard reports is vulnerable to automation; one who interprets data and recommends strategy is not. See Week 1 slides 13-14.

  - id: "W1-Q5-soft-skills-importance"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Clark's Five Strategies"

    question: |
      Why does Clark and Chamorro-Premuzic's framework emphasize developing soft skills (communication, creativity, empathy) in the AI era?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Because these human-centered capabilities cannot be automated and become more valuable as routine tasks are handled by AI"
        feedback: "Correct! Soft skills represent uniquely human capabilities that complement AI's strengths in data processing and pattern recognition."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Because technical skills are becoming obsolete and will no longer be needed"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Technical skills remain important—the framework emphasizes BOTH technical literacy AND soft skills. Soft skills are highlighted because they can't be automated, not because technical skills are obsolete."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Because soft skills are easier to develop than technical skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The emphasis on soft skills isn't about ease of development—it's about their uniquely human nature and resistance to automation in an AI-enabled economy."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Because employers prefer candidates with personality over competence"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This misrepresents the framework. Soft skills are emphasized because they enable collaboration, leadership, and creativity—competencies AI cannot replicate—not as a substitute for technical competence."

    general_feedback: |
      As AI handles routine <b>cognitive tasks</b> (mental work like calculations, data entry, and pattern recognition), <b>uniquely human</b> (capabilities only humans possess) abilities become more valuable. AI can process data but cannot read emotional cues, build trust, inspire teams, or navigate <b>ambiguous</b> (unclear, open to multiple interpretations) social situations. Communication, creativity, and empathy remain human domains. The framework argues for developing BOTH technical literacy (to work with AI) AND soft skills (to do what AI cannot). See Week 1 slides 13, 15-16.

  - id: "W1-Q6-ai-collaboration"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Clark's Five Strategies"

    question: |
      What does "Develop AI Collaboration" mean in Clark's framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Learning to work alongside AI tools by providing human judgment, ethics, and creativity while AI handles data processing and pattern recognition"
        feedback: "Correct! AI collaboration means using AI as a tool that amplifies human capabilities, with humans providing strategic direction and judgment while AI handles computational tasks."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Becoming an AI programmer or machine learning specialist"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While some may become AI specialists, 'AI collaboration' for most professionals means learning to work WITH AI tools in your field, not necessarily building them."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Replacing human workers with AI systems to improve efficiency"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This misunderstands the concept. AI collaboration is about humans and AI working together, each contributing their strengths—not AI replacing humans."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Avoiding AI tools to preserve job security"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is the opposite of the framework's recommendation. Those who learn to collaborate with AI will be more competitive than those who avoid it."

    general_feedback: |
      AI collaboration means developing a <b>complementary</b> (each contributing different strengths) relationship with AI tools. AI excels at processing large datasets, recognizing patterns, and performing <b>repetitive</b> (same tasks done repeatedly) analysis. Humans excel at <b>ethical reasoning</b> (making decisions based on values and principles), understanding context and <b>nuance</b> (subtle differences and complexities), and creative problem-solving. The most successful professionals position themselves as "AI supervisors"—using AI to handle routine work while they focus on strategy, judgment, and stakeholder relationships. See Week 1 slides 13, 16.

    topic: "WEF Skills Framework"

    question: |
      The WEF Skills Framework organizes top skills for 2025-2030 into four categories. Which three of these categories are included?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Cognitive Skills, Interpersonal Skills, Self-Management"
        feedback: "Correct! The WEF framework includes Cognitive Skills (thinking and learning), Interpersonal Skills (working with others), Self-Management (personal effectiveness), plus a fourth category for industry-specific Technical Skills."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Hard Skills, Soft Skills, Digital Skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While this is a common way to categorize skills, the WEF framework specifically uses Cognitive, Interpersonal, Self-Management, and Technical as its four categories."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Leadership Skills, Communication Skills, Problem-Solving Skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are specific skills within the broader categories. The WEF framework's three main categories are Cognitive, Interpersonal, and Self-Management (plus Technical)."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Technical Skills, Professional Skills, Personal Skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The WEF uses more specific categories: Cognitive (analytical, creative thinking), Interpersonal (leadership, empathy), and Self-Management (resilience, lifelong learning)."

    general_feedback: |
      The WEF framework divides essential skills into four categories: <b>Cognitive</b> (mental abilities like analytical and creative thinking), <b>Interpersonal</b> (social abilities like leadership and empathy), <b>Self-Management</b> (personal abilities like resilience and lifelong learning), and <b>Technical</b> (industry-specific tools and knowledge). Notice that 3 of 4 categories are "soft skills"—this shows that success requires more than technical knowledge. The framework helps you assess which category needs development in your Personal Development Plan. See Week 1 slide 17.

  - id: "W1-Q8-analytical-vs-creative"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "WEF Skills Framework"

    question: |
      How do analytical thinking and creative thinking differ as cognitive skills in the WEF framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Analytical thinking breaks problems into components and evaluates options systematically; creative thinking generates novel solutions and connects unrelated concepts"
        feedback: "Correct! These are complementary cognitive skills—analytical thinking provides rigor and structure, while creative thinking enables innovation and originality."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Analytical thinking is for technical roles; creative thinking is for artistic roles"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both skills are valuable across all fields. Business professionals need both—analyzing data AND generating innovative solutions."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Analytical thinking is more important than creative thinking in the AI era"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The WEF framework lists both as top-tier skills. AI can assist with routine analysis, making human creativity even more valuable."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Analytical thinking can be learned; creative thinking is innate"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Research shows both are learnable skills that improve with practice and deliberate development."

    general_feedback: |
      <b>Analytical thinking</b> is <b>systematic</b> (following a structured, step-by-step approach): breaking complex problems into manageable parts, identifying patterns, and evaluating options based on evidence. <b>Creative thinking</b> is <b>generative</b> (producing new ideas and possibilities): connecting seemingly unrelated concepts, challenging assumptions, and imagining new solutions. Both are essential—analysis without creativity leads to <b>incremental</b> (small, gradual) improvements; creativity without analysis leads to impractical ideas. The best professionals integrate both. See Week 1 slide 18.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Career Development Framework"

    question: |
      What are the four pillars of the Career Development Framework presented in the lecture?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Self-Awareness, Market Awareness, Skills Development, Strategic Action"
        feedback: "Correct! This framework structures the Personal Development Plan: understanding yourself, understanding opportunities, bridging gaps, and taking concrete steps."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Education, Experience, Employment, Entrepreneurship"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are career pathways, not the four-pillar framework for personal development planning."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Vision, Goals, Planning, Execution"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these are elements of planning, the four-pillar framework specifically includes Self-Awareness, Market Awareness, Skills Development, and Strategic Action."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes SWOT analysis, which is a tool used within the framework, but not the four pillars themselves."

    general_feedback: |
      The Four-Pillar Framework guides <b>systematic</b> (organized and methodical) career planning: (1) <b>Self-Awareness</b> means understanding your strengths, values, and interests. (2) <b>Market Awareness</b> means understanding what skills employers value and where opportunities exist. (3) <b>Skills Development</b> means bridging the gap between your current capabilities and market needs. (4) <b>Strategic Action</b> means creating a concrete plan with specific goals, timelines, and accountability. Your Personal Development Plan will address all four pillars. See Week 1 slide 21.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Career Development Framework"

    question: |
      In the context of career planning, how does SWOT analysis apply to the Four-Pillar Framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Strengths and Weaknesses identify your current state (Self-Awareness), while Opportunities and Threats identify external factors (Market Awareness)"
        feedback: "Correct! SWOT bridges self-awareness and market awareness by analyzing internal capabilities alongside external opportunities and challenges."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "SWOT analysis replaces the Four-Pillar Framework entirely"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SWOT is a tool used within the framework, specifically supporting pillars 1 and 2 (Self-Awareness and Market Awareness), not a replacement for the entire framework."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Only Strengths and Weaknesses matter; Opportunities and Threats are external and uncontrollable"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While you can't control external factors, understanding Opportunities (market trends, growing fields) and Threats (skills becoming obsolete, industry disruption) is essential for strategic career planning."

      - key: "D"
        text: "SWOT is used only for business strategy, not personal career planning"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SWOT is a strategic planning tool borrowed from business that applies effectively to personal career development by analyzing internal and external factors."

    general_feedback: |
      <b>SWOT analysis</b> maps your internal state against external reality. <b>Strengths</b> are skills you already possess. <b>Weaknesses</b> are gaps you need to address. <b>Opportunities</b> are market needs and growing fields where demand exists. <b>Threats</b> are factors that could prevent success (skills becoming obsolete, industry decline). The goal: leverage strengths to pursue opportunities, address weaknesses that block your path, and prepare for threats. This analysis informs the Skills Development and Strategic Action pillars of your PDP. See Week 1 slide 24.

    type: "true_false"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Deloitte Human Capital Trends"

    question: |
      True or False: According to Deloitte's 2024 Global Human Capital Trends report, 89% of executives say their organization advances human sustainability, but only 41% of workers agree.

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "True"
        feedback: "Correct! This 48-percentage-point gap reveals a significant disconnect between leadership perception and worker experience regarding organizational support for employee wellbeing and development."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "False"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This statement is accurate. Deloitte found that 89% of executives believe they support human sustainability, while only 41% of workers share this view—a concerning perception gap."

    general_feedback: |
      The <b>perception gap</b> (difference in how two groups view the same situation) between executives (89%) and workers (41%) signals a critical problem: leaders believe they're creating <b>sustainable</b> (able to be maintained long-term) work environments, but employees don't feel supported. <b>Human sustainability</b> means creating conditions where people can thrive, grow, and maintain wellbeing while performing effectively. This gap has implications for your career: seek employers who actually invest in development (demonstrated through actions, not just claims), and take ownership of your own growth rather than relying on organizational support. See Week 1 slide 10.

  - id: "W1-Q12-lifelong-learning"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "WEF Skills Framework"

    question: |
      Why is "Curiosity and Lifelong Learning" ranked as a top self-management skill in the WEF framework for 2025-2030?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Because if 40% of skills change by 2030, professionals must continuously learn new capabilities throughout their careers"
        feedback: "Correct! The rapid pace of change means your degree is a foundation, not a finish line. Continuous learning becomes a core professional competency."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Because employers prefer candidates who take many online courses"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While online learning is one method, the skill is about the mindset and habit of continuous learning in response to rapid skills evolution, not course-taking specifically."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Because curiosity makes people more creative than analytical"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Curiosity supports both creative AND analytical thinking. It's ranked highly because of the need to adapt to rapid skills change, not because it favors one type of thinking."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Because traditional education will become obsolete by 2030"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Traditional education remains valuable as a foundation. Lifelong learning is emphasized because skills must be updated continuously beyond initial education, not because universities will disappear."

    general_feedback: |
      The <b>half-life of skills</b> (time until skills become outdated) is shrinking rapidly. Technical skills learned in Year 1 may be <b>obsolete</b> (no longer useful or relevant) by graduation. If 40% of skills change by 2030, professionals cannot rely solely on their degree—they must cultivate <b>curiosity</b> (desire to learn and understand new things) and commit to <b>lifelong learning</b> (continuous skill development throughout your career). This means following industry trends, seeking feedback, taking courses, reading beyond your major, and embracing the discomfort of not knowing. Learning HOW to learn becomes more valuable than memorizing facts. See Week 1 slide 19.
