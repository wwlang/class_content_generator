    question: |
      According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025, what percentage of job skills are projected to change by 2030?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "20%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The actual percentage is higher—40% of job skills are projected to change by 2030 according to the WEF 2025 report."

      - key: "B"
        text: "30%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While significant, the WEF projects an even higher rate of change—40% of job skills will change by 2030."

      - key: "C"
        text: "40%"
        feedback: "Correct! The WEF 2025 report projects that 40% of job skills will change by 2030, indicating significant transformation in workplace skill requirements over just five years."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "50%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While very high, the actual projection is 40% of job skills changing by 2030 according to the WEF report."

    general_feedback: |
      This statistic is foundational to understanding the urgency of future-proofing your career. When nearly half of required skills will change within five years, the ability to learn continuously and adapt becomes more valuable than any specific technical skill you possess today. In your <b>Personal Development Plan</b>, you'll want to emphasize learning agility and strategies for staying current in your field.

    topic: "WEF Future of Jobs Report (2025)"

    question: |
      The WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 projects that 92 million jobs will be displaced but 170 million new jobs will be created by 2030. What is the correct interpretation of these findings?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Technology will cause mass unemployment globally"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The data shows net job creation, not mass unemployment. 170 million new jobs exceed the 92 million displaced, resulting in net +78 million jobs."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Job creation will exceed job displacement, but different skills will be needed"
        feedback: "Correct! Job creation exceeds displacement (net +78 million jobs), but the new jobs require different skills. This is workforce transformation, not unemployment."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Only technology workers will find employment in 2030"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While technical roles are growing, the WEF report identifies diverse job growth including sustainability specialists, business analysts, and many non-technical roles."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Traditional jobs will remain unchanged for most workers"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The 40% skill change projection indicates that even workers staying in their fields will need significant reskilling and upskilling."

    general_feedback: |
      This nuanced understanding is critical for strategic career planning. Rather than fearing automation, focus on positioning yourself for the jobs being created. Ask yourself: <b>Are my skills aligned with growing sectors or declining ones?</b> Your tutorial self-assessment and discussions with your mentor should help you identify skill gaps between your current capabilities and future labor market needs.

    topic: "WEF Future of Jobs Report (2025)"

    question: |
      Which pattern best describes the fastest-growing roles identified in the WEF 2025 report (such as AI/ML Specialists, Business Intelligence Analysts, and Digital Transformation Specialists)?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Pure technical roles requiring only coding skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Even technical roles like Business Intelligence Analysts require human judgment and communication skills beyond pure technical ability."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Roles combining technology literacy with human judgment and specialized expertise"
        feedback: "Correct! The fastest-growing roles combine technology literacy + human judgment + specialized expertise—not technical skills alone."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Traditional business roles unchanged by technology"
        feedback: "Incorrect. All the fastest-growing roles integrate technology. Even traditional business roles now require digital fluency."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Roles that require minimal education or training"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The fastest-growing roles typically require significant education and continuous learning due to their technical and strategic complexity."

    general_feedback: |
      This pattern has direct implications for your skill development strategy. Don't focus exclusively on technical skills OR soft skills—the highest-value roles require both. As you plan your <b>Personal Development Plan</b>, ensure you're building complementary capabilities: technical fluency in tools like AI, critical thinking to apply those tools strategically, and communication skills to translate insights for stakeholders.

    topic: "Vietnam Labor Market Context"

    question: |
      According to the Vietnam labor market data presented in Week 1, what percentage of Vietnamese workers have formal degrees or certificates?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Only 28.1%"
        feedback: "Correct! Only 28.1% of Vietnamese workers have degrees or certificates, positioning NEU graduates in the top 30% of the workforce by education alone."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Approximately 50%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The percentage is much lower—only 28.1% of Vietnamese workers have formal degrees or certificates."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Over 60%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This significantly overstates the level of formal education. Only 28.1% of Vietnamese workers have degrees or certificates."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Nearly 80%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The actual figure is much lower—only 28.1% of Vietnamese workers have formal degrees or certificates."

    general_feedback: |
      Understanding this statistic helps you contextualize your competitive position. Your NEU degree provides a foundation, but differentiation within the educated 28% requires additional capabilities. The World Bank research on Vietnam identifies <b>cognitive skills</b> (problem-solving, critical thinking) and <b>behavioral skills</b> (teamwork, adaptability, leadership) as the key gaps employers struggle to fill. Developing these skills through mentorship, experiential learning, and reflective practice is how you stand out even among degree-holders.

    topic: "Vietnam Labor Market Context"

    question: |
      The World Bank report on Vietnam's labor market (Cunningham & Pimhidzai, 2018) found that employers struggle most to find workers with which types of skills?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Basic technical skills like using Microsoft Office"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Technical skills are generally adequate at entry-level according to the World Bank report. The gaps are in cognitive and behavioral skills."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Advanced engineering and programming skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While specialized technical skills are valued, employers report the greatest difficulty finding cognitive and behavioral skills, not advanced technical training."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Cognitive skills (critical thinking, problem-solving) and behavioral skills (teamwork, adaptability)"
        feedback: "Correct! Vietnamese employers struggle most to find cognitive skills (critical thinking, problem-solving) and behavioral skills (teamwork, leadership, adaptability)."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "English language proficiency exclusively"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While English is important, the World Bank report identifies cognitive and behavioral skills as the primary gaps, which apply even to Vietnamese-language roles."

    general_feedback: |
      This finding reveals a strategic opportunity: the skills Vietnamese employers need most are precisely the skills this course develops through mentorship, reflective learning, experiential activities, and self-assessment. When you engage authentically with the <b>field trip</b> to MISA, <b>guest speaker</b> session with Ms. Ha Linh, and your <b>mentorship program</b>, you're not just completing course requirements—you're building the exact capabilities that differentiate candidates in the Vietnamese job market.

    topic: "Vietnam Labor Market Context"

    question: |
      Which of the following roles were identified as high-demand positions in Vietnam's labor market in 2024?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Traditional manufacturing and agricultural workers"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these sectors still employ many, the high-demand roles requiring skilled workers are in technology and digital transformation fields."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Data Engineers, AI/ML Engineers, Cybersecurity Specialists, and Digital Marketing Specialists"
        feedback: "Correct! High-demand roles in Vietnam include Data Engineers, AI/ML Engineers, Cybersecurity Specialists, and Digital Marketing Specialists—reflecting digital transformation."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Administrative assistants and data entry clerks"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are being automated or reduced in demand. High-demand roles require technical skills and strategic thinking."

      - key: "D"
        text: "General management positions requiring no technical skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Even management positions now require digital fluency. The high-demand roles integrate technology with business expertise."

    general_feedback: |
      Even if you don't pursue one of these specific technical roles, notice the pattern: <b>digital fluency is increasingly non-negotiable</b> across business functions. Marketing requires understanding digital channels and analytics. Business analysis requires data interpretation. Management requires understanding how to leverage technology strategically. This is why Week 2 focuses on AI-era skills and human-AI collaboration—these capabilities are becoming foundational for business graduates, not optional specializations.

    topic: "Five Future-Proofing Strategies"

    question: |
      According to Clark and Chamorro-Premuzic's HBR article, which of the following is NOT one of the five strategies to future-proof your career in the age of AI?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Avoid predictability"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'Avoid predictability' IS one of the five strategies—seeking roles that require contextual judgment rather than routine tasks."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Focus exclusively on technical skills"
        feedback: "Correct! 'Focus exclusively on technical skills' is NOT a recommended strategy. The framework emphasizes balancing technical literacy with soft skills."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Build genuine human relationships"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'Build genuine human relationships' IS one of the five strategies—networking and trust-building that AI cannot replicate."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Develop soft skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'Develop soft skills' IS one of the five strategies—communication, empathy, creativity, and emotional intelligence become MORE valuable as technical work automates."

    general_feedback: |
      This is a common misconception worth addressing: many students assume that in a tech-driven future, only technical skills matter. The opposite is true. As routine technical work gets automated, what remains is inherently more complex, more human-centered, and requires <b>judgment, creativity, empathy, and communication</b>. Your career strategy should develop technical literacy AND human skills, not technical skills exclusively.

    question: |
      The future-proofing strategy "Avoid Predictability" is based on which core principle?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Unpredictable work schedules help build resilience"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This misinterprets the strategy. 'Avoid Predictability' refers to the nature of work tasks, not scheduling unpredictability."

      - key: "B"
        text: "If a job can be reduced to predictable, rules-based steps, it can be automated"
        feedback: "Correct! 'Avoid Predictability' means if work is predictable and rules-based, it's automatable. Seek roles requiring contextual judgment."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Career planning should avoid setting concrete goals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The strategy is about the predictability of work tasks themselves, not about avoiding goal-setting (which is actually important for career planning)."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Workers should frequently change jobs to avoid boredom"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The strategy is about seeking work involving novelty and judgment within roles, not about job-hopping."

    general_feedback: |
      Apply this principle when evaluating career paths and job opportunities. Ask yourself: "Could the core tasks of this role be reduced to a set of predictable steps?" If yes, that role faces high automation risk. Seek roles where you're solving novel problems, making judgment calls in ambiguous situations, or creating something new. For example, <b>data entry is predictable; data interpretation requiring business context is not</b>. Position yourself accordingly.

    question: |
      Why does the strategy "Build Genuine Human Relationships" become MORE important in the AI era rather than less?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "AI has eliminated the need for technical skills, making relationships the only differentiator"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Technical skills still matter. The point is that relationships become a key differentiator IN ADDITION TO technical capabilities."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Networking events are now held virtually, making them easier to attend"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The format of networking is not the core reason. The strategy emphasizes that human decision-making remains based on trust and relationships."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Humans make final decisions based on trust and relationships, which AI cannot replicate"
        feedback: "Correct! Relationship-building matters more because humans make decisions based on trust and relationships—something AI cannot replicate."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "Relationship-building is easier than developing technical skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The strategy is based on the irreplaceability of human relationships, not on ease of development."

    general_feedback: |
      Your <b>mentorship program</b> is a structured opportunity to practice professional relationship-building. Approach it strategically: prepare thoughtfully for meetings, follow through on mentor advice, maintain contact beyond minimum requirements. The field trip to MISA and guest speaker session are networking opportunities—connect with people on LinkedIn afterward, send thank-you messages, request informational interviews. These relationship-building actions compound over your career and often matter more than perfect grades.

    question: |
      The strategy "Aim for Originality" may be particularly challenging for Vietnamese students because:

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Vietnamese students lack creativity compared to other nationalities"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is a harmful stereotype. Vietnamese students have equal creative potential; the challenge is educational system emphasis, not innate ability."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Vietnamese education traditionally emphasizes mastering established knowledge over innovation"
        feedback: "Correct! Vietnamese education traditionally emphasizes mastering established knowledge and following best practices, making innovation feel less comfortable—but this is developable."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Original thinking is not valued in Vietnamese business culture"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Vietnamese business increasingly values innovation and entrepreneurship. The challenge is educational preparation, not cultural values."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Vietnamese language structure makes original thinking impossible"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Language does not limit original thinking. The challenge is educational system emphasis on mastery over innovation."

    general_feedback: |
      If you rated yourself low on "originality" in your tutorial self-assessment, recognize this is common and addressable. Start small: in class discussions, propose one unconventional idea. In group projects, suggest an approach that hasn't been tried before. Read case studies of successful Vietnamese entrepreneurs. Week 10's focus on <b>entrepreneurial mindset</b> and the guest speaker session will provide additional exposure to innovative thinking. Remember: originality doesn't mean reckless risk-taking—it means thoughtfully questioning assumptions and proposing new approaches.

    topic: "Human-AI Collaboration"

    question: |
      Which of the following is a key capability for effective human-AI collaboration according to Week 1 content?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Using AI to replace all human thinking and judgment"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Effective collaboration requires maintaining human judgment, not replacing it. AI supports human thinking; it doesn't replace it."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Avoiding AI tools entirely to preserve human jobs"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Avoiding AI is not a viable strategy. The goal is to learn how to work WITH AI effectively, not avoid it."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Context engineering—crafting effective prompts and queries for AI tools"
        feedback: "Correct! Context engineering—the ability to craft effective prompts and queries—is a key human-AI collaboration skill that will be explored in Week 2."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "Memorizing AI-generated outputs without evaluation"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Blindly accepting AI outputs is dangerous. Effective collaboration requires critical evaluation of AI outputs, not memorization."

    general_feedback: |
      Human-AI collaboration is not about humans OR AI—it's about humans AND AI working together strategically. You provide contextual understanding, judgment, creativity, and ethical guidance. AI provides processing speed, pattern recognition, and content generation. <b>The most valuable workers won't be those who ignore AI or those who blindly trust it, but those who leverage AI while maintaining critical judgment.</b> Before Week 2, experiment with an AI tool as assigned—practice crafting clear prompts and critically evaluating outputs.

    topic: "Human-AI Collaboration"

    question: |
      When the lecture discusses developing "critical evaluation" skills for AI outputs, what does this mean in practice?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Criticizing AI tools in social media posts"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'Critical evaluation' means analytical assessment of outputs, not public criticism or complaining about AI tools."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Knowing when to trust AI output and when to question or verify it"
        feedback: "Correct! Critical evaluation means knowing when to trust AI output and when to question or verify it—applying human judgment to AI-generated content."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Avoiding AI tools because they are unreliable"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The solution is not avoidance but developing judgment about when AI is reliable and when it requires human verification."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Using only the most expensive AI tools"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Critical evaluation is about your analytical skills, not about which tools cost more money. Even expensive tools require human judgment."

    general_feedback: |
      This skill will be essential throughout your career. As AI tools become ubiquitous in the workplace, employers will value workers who can leverage AI for productivity while catching errors and adding human judgment. In your coursework, when you use AI tools for assignments, don't just copy outputs—verify facts, evaluate quality, and add your own analysis. This practice develops the <b>complementary thinking</b> that makes human-AI collaboration effective rather than producing low-quality "workslop" (mediocre AI-generated content we'll discuss in Week 2).
