## Detailed Activity Facilitation

### Activity 1: Icebreaker—Two Truths and a Career Dream (15 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual prep: 3 minutes
- Small group sharing: 10 minutes
- Whole-class debrief: 2 minutes

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to say:**

"Welcome to tutorial! Today we're diving into the work of personal and professional development. This isn't a passive lecture—you'll be actively engaging, reflecting, and sharing.

We're starting with an icebreaker that serves two purposes: getting to know each other and beginning to articulate career aspirations. Many people have never said their career dreams out loud. Today, you will."

#### Individual Preparation (3 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"On paper or in your notes, write:
- Two truths about yourself (anything—hobbies, background, experiences)
- One career dream (a job, industry, accomplishment you aspire to—can be ambitious, uncertain, or still forming)

You have 3 minutes. Go."

**Circulate while students write. If someone looks stuck:**

- "Your career dream doesn't have to be fully formed. What's something that interests you, even if you're not sure about it yet?"
- "Think about the 5-year vision we discussed in lecture. What might you want to be doing?"

#### Small Group Sharing (10 minutes)

**Form groups:**

"Form groups of 4-5. Introduce yourselves using your two truths and career dream. After each person shares, others can ask ONE clarifying question about the career dream. I'll give you 10 minutes—that's about 2 minutes per person. Go."

**Tutor role during this phase:**

- Circulate between groups
- Listen for interesting career dreams to highlight later
- Gently redirect groups that get off-topic or dominate conversation
- Note students who seem reluctant to share (check in with them individually later)

**If a group finishes early:**

"Great! Now discuss: What do you notice about the career dreams in your group? Any patterns or surprises?"

#### Whole-Class Debrief (2 minutes)

**Bring class back together:**

"Let's hear from a few groups. What did you notice about the career dreams shared?"

**Facilitate brief responses (3-4 students):**

- Listen for patterns (e.g., "Many people want to start businesses," "Several people mentioned AI or tech")
- Affirm uncertainty: "It's okay if your dream is still vague—that's why we're here"

**Close with key takeaway:**

"You've just done what many people never do—articulated a career aspiration out loud. Throughout this course, we'll help you move from vague dreams to concrete, strategic plans backed by self-knowledge and research."

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student says "I don't have a career dream" | Reframe: "What's something you're curious about? What do you enjoy doing? Start there." |
| Student shares unrealistic/generic dream | Affirm and probe: "That's exciting! What specifically draws you to that?" (Help them get concrete) |
| Group dominates conversation with truths, ignores career dreams | Redirect: "Make sure you're asking about the career dream—that's the important part for this course." |
| Students reluctant to share in groups | Model vulnerability first: Share your own career journey and early uncertainties |

---

### Activity 2: The AI Era—Fears, Hopes, and Realities (20 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual reflection: 5 minutes
- Small group discussion: 10 minutes
- Whole-class synthesis: 5 minutes

#### Setup (1 minute)

**Point to three posters/board sections:**

"We're going to process the lecture content about the future of work. I want to hear your authentic reactions—not what you think you're supposed to say, but what you actually feel."

**Point to each section:**
- "FEARS: What worries you about AI and the future of work?"
- "HOPES: What excites you or gives you optimism?"
- "REALITIES: What do we actually know based on research?"

#### Individual Reflection (5 minutes)

**Prompt:**

"Take 5 minutes to write freely—no one will see this unless you choose to share. Reflect on:

- What worries you most about competing with AI or automation?
- What opportunities do you see in the changing job market?
- How prepared do you feel right now for the future of work described in today's lecture?
- What skills do you think you need to develop most urgently?

Be honest. This is for you."

**Tutor role:**

- **Write alongside students** (model the practice of reflection)
- Maintain silence—let students think deeply without interruption
- If someone finishes early: "Go deeper. What's underneath that worry? What would it take to address it?"

#### Small Group Discussion (10 minutes)

**Form same groups as Activity 1 or new groups of 4-5.**

**Instructions:**

"You'll discuss three questions—about 3 minutes each:

1. **Share one fear from your reflection.** Do others share this concern?
2. **Share one hope or opportunity you see.** How could you position yourself to benefit from technological change?
3. **Based on today's lecture, what's one concrete action you could take this semester to better prepare for the AI era?**

I'll let you know when to move to the next question."

**Tutor role:**

- Circulate and listen actively
- Note common themes to bring up in synthesis
- Encourage depth: "Can you give a specific example?" "What would that look like in practice?"
- **Time-check verbally:** "Move to question 2: hopes and opportunities" (after ~3 minutes)

**Listen for these common fears (validate them later):**

- "AI will take my job"
- "I'm not technical enough"
- "I don't know what skills to develop"
- "The job market is too uncertain"
- "I'm competing globally now, not just locally"

**Listen for these common hopes (amplify them later):**

- "New industries and opportunities I can't even imagine yet"
- "I can use AI as a tool to be more productive"
- "Vietnam's economy is growing—lots of opportunity"
- "Human skills (creativity, empathy) are becoming more valuable"

#### Whole-Class Synthesis (5 minutes)

**Bring class together:**

"Let's capture what you discussed. I heard some powerful insights."

**Ask for volunteers (or call on groups):**

- "Share one common fear from your group." (Write on FEARS poster—aim for 5-6 distinct fears)
- "Share one common hope." (Write on HOPES poster—aim for 4-5 hopes)

**Then, connect to lecture content (REALITIES section):**

"Now let's ground this in research. Here's what we actually know:"

**Point to lecture content and emphasize:**

- **Reality 1:** Net +78 million jobs by 2030 (WEF)—jobs are changing, not disappearing
- **Reality 2:** Skills that matter are uniquely human—creativity, empathy, judgment, relationships (HBR)
- **Reality 3:** Your advantage comes from continuous development, not static knowledge
- **Reality 4:** Vietnam's skills gap is your opportunity—cognitive and behavioral skills are in high demand (World Bank)

**Close with:**

"Your fears are valid. But they're also solvable—through the work we'll do in this course. Keep these in mind as we move through the semester. By Week 11, when you present your Personal Development Plan, you'll have a concrete strategy for navigating this uncertainty."

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Students too anxious to engage productively | Normalize anxiety: "Feeling uncertain is rational and healthy. It motivates development." |
| Students overly optimistic/dismissive of real challenges | Ground in research: "Optimism is good, but we need strategic preparation, not hope alone." |
| Conversation becomes too abstract or political | Redirect to personal: "How does this affect YOUR career preparation specifically?" |
| Students focus only on negative | Actively solicit positives: "What's ONE opportunity you see for yourself in this changing landscape?" |

---

### Activity 3: Skills Self-Assessment—Where Are You Now? (20 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual assessment completion: 12 minutes
- Pair-share discussion: 8 minutes

#### Setup (1 minute)

**Distribute Skills Self-Assessment handouts (or instruct students to use notebooks).**

**What to say:**

"Personal development requires knowing where you are now before you can plan where you're going. You're about to complete a skills inventory based on today's lecture content—the WEF top 10 skills, Vietnam-specific skills from the World Bank report, and HBR's future-proofing strategies.

**Rate yourself honestly on a 1-5 scale:**
- 1 = Not developed
- 2 = Developing
- 3 = Competent
- 4 = Strong
- 5 = Expert

**Don't be modest, but don't inflate. The goal is accurate self-assessment, not high scores.**"

#### Individual Work (12 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"Complete all three sections of the assessment. After rating your current level for each skill, set a target level (where you need to be for your career goals) and mark priorities (Low/Med/High urgency).

You have 12 minutes. Work independently and honestly."

**Tutor role:**

- Circulate and answer clarification questions
- **Don't** suggest ratings—this is individual self-assessment
- Encourage depth: "Think about specific situations where you've used—or struggled with—this skill."

**Common questions and responses:**

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "What if I don't know what level I'm at?" | "Make your best guess based on recent experiences. Uncertainty is data—note skills you're unsure about." |
| "Should I rate myself where I am now or where I could be with effort?" | "Current level = where you honestly are TODAY. Target level = where you need to be." |
| "What if I'm a 5 in something?" | "5 means expert-level, exceptional competency. That's rare but possible—especially for signature strengths." |
| "All my priorities are HIGH!" | "Prioritization means choosing. Which 3-5 gaps would most accelerate your career if you closed them?" |

#### Pair-Share Discussion (8 minutes)

**Form pairs (not same groups as before—mix it up).**

**Discussion prompts:**

"Discuss with your partner:

1. **Which skill surprised you?** (Either rated yourself higher or lower than expected) — 2 minutes

2. **What are your top 3 priority skills to develop?** Why these three? — 3 minutes

3. **How could this course help you develop these skills?** Think about assessments, mentorship, reflective essay, PDP. — 3 minutes"

**Tutor role:**

- Circulate and listen for insights to share in closing
- Encourage specificity: "What would improving that skill look like in practice?"
- **Time-check verbally** to keep pairs moving through questions

#### Key Takeaway (1 minute)

**Bring class back together:**

"What you just completed is the foundation of a **skills gap analysis**—a core component of your Personal Development Plan worth 40% of your grade.

**The formula is simple:**
- Current level = where you are
- Target level = where you need to be
- Gap = what you need to develop
- Priority = what to focus on first

**This isn't about harsh self-judgment. It's about strategic awareness. You can't close a gap you haven't identified.**

**Save this assessment.** You'll revisit and refine it when creating your PDP in Week 11. By then, you'll have insights from five validated assessment tools and mentorship feedback to inform an even deeper analysis."

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student rates everything low (imposter syndrome) | Affirm strengths: "I notice you rated communication as 2, but you've been articulating ideas clearly all class. Reconsider." |
| Student rates everything high (overconfidence) | Gentle challenge: "If you're already at 4-5 in most skills, what will you develop this semester?" |
| Student sets all targets at 5 (unrealistic) | Clarify: "Target level should reflect what your career NEEDS, not perfection. A 4 in most skills is exceptional." |
| Student struggles with concept of "priority" | Frame practically: "You have limited time. If you could only develop 3 skills this year, which would have the biggest career impact?" |

### Activity 4: Career Vision Brainstorming—The 5-Year Snapshot (15 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Visualization exercise: 10 minutes (guided visualization + writing)
- Pair-share: 5 minutes

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to say:**

"In Week 11, you'll write a 50-word vision statement for your Personal Development Plan. Today, we're gathering raw material for that vision.

We're going to do a visualization exercise. This might feel unfamiliar, but research shows that people who can clearly envision their future are significantly more likely to achieve their goals. Why? Because vision drives daily decisions.

**I'm going to guide you through imagining a day in your life 5 years from now—in 2030.**"

#### Visualization Exercise (10 minutes)

**Create calm environment:**
- Dim lights slightly if possible
- Ask students to put away phones
- Encourage closing eyes or focusing on paper

**Guided visualization (read slowly, with pauses):**

"Close your eyes or focus on your notebook. Take a deep breath.

**Imagine it's 2030—five years from now. You've graduated from NEU, worked for a few years, developed new skills, and made strategic career choices.**

**Visualize waking up on a typical workday.**

[Pause 5 seconds]

**Where are you waking up?** Hanoi? Another city in Vietnam? Abroad? Working remotely from anywhere?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**What industry are you working in?** Finance? Marketing? Technology? Education? Sustainability?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**What's your job title or role?** Try to imagine something specific.

[Pause 5 seconds]

**What kind of work are you doing today?** Are you in meetings? Analyzing data? Creating content? Managing a team? Solving problems?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**Who are you working with?** A small team? Independently? International colleagues? Clients?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**What skills are you using most often?** Communication? Technical skills? Creativity? Leadership?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**What problems are you solving?** What impact is your work having on customers, society, or Vietnam's economy?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**How do you feel at the end of your workday?** Energized? Fulfilled? Proud? Challenged in a good way?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**What are people saying about you professionally?** What's your reputation? What are you known for?

[Pause 5 seconds]

**Now, hold that image. Open your eyes.**"

**Writing (5 minutes):**

"Write for 5 minutes: Describe this day. Don't worry about being realistic or practical yet—just capture the vision. What did you see? What stood out?"

**Tutor role during writing:**

- Write alongside students (model the practice)
- Maintain quiet space for focused writing
- If someone seems stuck: "Just write what came to mind, even if it's fragmented. That's okay."

#### Pair-Share (5 minutes)

**Form pairs.**

**Instructions:**

"Share with your partner:

1. **One specific detail from your 5-year vision.** (e.g., 'I'm leading a digital marketing team for a Vietnamese startup') — 2 minutes

2. **What would need to happen between now and then to make this vision real?** Skills? Experiences? Networks? Opportunities? — 3 minutes"

**Tutor role:**

- Circulate and listen for compelling visions to affirm
- Encourage specificity: "What specifically about that role appeals to you?"
- **Listen for students whose vision aligns with course themes**—you can reference these later

#### Key Takeaway (1 minute)

**Bring class together:**

"Many of you have never deliberately envisioned your professional future in concrete detail.

**Here's why this matters: Vision drives decisions.**

- When choosing electives → your vision guides you
- When evaluating internship offers → your vision guides you
- When deciding how to spend time → your vision guides you

**Without vision, you make reactive decisions. With vision, you make strategic decisions.**

We'll refine this vision throughout the semester using self-assessment insights, mentor guidance, and strategic planning. But now you have a starting point."

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student can't visualize anything | Simplify: "Just imagine one thing—where you're working. A company? Your own business? Start there." |
| Student's vision is vague or generic | Probe for details: "What does a 'successful businessperson' look like specifically? What industry? What role?" |
| Student's vision seems unrealistic | Don't judge: "Great! Now, what would be the FIRST step toward that in the next year?" |
| Student feels anxious about not knowing | Normalize: "It's okay if your vision is unclear. That's why you're in this course—to gain clarity." |

### Activity 5: Mentorship Program Orientation (15 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Program overview: 7 minutes
- Documentation requirements: 5 minutes
- Q&A: 3 minutes

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to say:**

"One of the most valuable components of this course is the mentorship program. You'll be paired one-on-one with an experienced business professional for 10 weeks.

This isn't a passive relationship where you just listen to advice. It's an active partnership where you bring questions, self-assessment insights, and draft plans, and your mentor helps you refine your thinking.

Let me explain how it works and how to maximize this opportunity."

#### Program Overview (7 minutes)

**Cover key details:**

**What is the program?**

- 10-week program (September 23 - November 30)
- One-on-one with business professional from ISME
- Minimum 4 meetings (at least 2 face-to-face)
- Worth 20% of final grade
- Focus: marketing, personal management, or career orientation

**Why does mentorship matter?**

**Share research findings:**

"Studies consistently show that professionals with mentors:
- Advance faster (promotions come sooner)
- Earn 5-20% more on average
- Report greater job satisfaction
- Build stronger networks
- Navigate career transitions more successfully

**Mentorship isn't magic—but it's powerful when done well.**"

**What makes a good mentee?**

**Write these on board as you explain:**

1. **Preparation:** Come with clear objectives and questions (not "I don't know, what should we talk about?")
2. **Active listening:** Take notes; ask follow-ups; show genuine interest
3. **Follow-through:** If your mentor suggests reading something or trying something, DO IT
4. **Reflection:** Don't just collect advice—think deeply about how to apply it
5. **Professionalism:** Punctuality, respect for time, appreciation
6. **Integration:** Incorporate mentor feedback into your PDP

**Emphasize:**

"Your mentor is volunteering their time. They're busy professionals. **Respect their time by being prepared. Honor their advice by taking it seriously.**"

#### Meeting Requirements and Documentation (5 minutes)

**Explain submission requirements:**

**For each meeting, you submit TWO forms:**

**1. Pre-Meeting Preparation Form (48 hours before)**

"This includes:
- Meeting objectives (What do you want to accomplish?)
- Prepared questions (minimum 3-5 thoughtful questions)
- Updates since last meeting
- Self-assessment insights to discuss
- Relevant course content to explore

**Why 48 hours before?** So instructors can review and suggest additional questions if helpful."

**2. Post-Meeting Reflection Form (48 hours after)**

"This includes:
- Meeting summary
- Key insights gained
- Advice received and how you'll apply it
- Action items with deadlines
- Reflections on your professional development
- Topics for next meeting

**Why 48 hours after?** Reflection is most effective when the experience is fresh."

**Show sample forms if available** (quick 1-minute overview of structure).

**Recommended timeline:**

- **Meeting 1 (Weeks 2-3):** Getting to know each other; share backgrounds
- **Meeting 2 (Weeks 4-5):** Self-discovery; share MBTI, VIA, Holland Code results
- **Meeting 3 (Weeks 7-8):** Skills development; discuss SWOT and preliminary goals
- **Meeting 4 (Weeks 10-11):** PDP review; get feedback on draft plan

#### Q&A (3 minutes)

**Open for questions. Common questions:**

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "What if I can't meet face-to-face?" | "At least 2 of 4 must be face-to-face. Others can be virtual. If you have exceptional circumstances, talk to coordinators." |
| "What if my mentor and I don't connect?" | "Reach out to coordinators immediately. Don't wait until Week 10. We can facilitate or re-pair if needed." |
| "How do I schedule meetings?" | "You coordinate directly with your mentor. Be proactive—suggest specific times, don't just ask 'When are you free?'" |
| "What if my mentor cancels?" | "Reschedule promptly. If cancellations become a pattern, inform coordinators." |
| "Can I contact my mentor outside the 4 meetings?" | "Yes, if your mentor is willing! But respect their time—don't abuse the relationship." |

**Close with:**

"Mentorship can be a turning point in your career. I've seen students gain job referrals, internship opportunities, and lifelong professional relationships from this program.

**It's worth the effort. Engage authentically.**"

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Students anxious about meeting professionals | Normalize: "Your mentor wants to help. They were students once too. Prepare well and be yourself." |
| Students unclear on what questions to ask | Provide examples: "Tell me about a career decision you made. How did you know it was right?" |
| Students treat it as passive (just listening) | Reframe: "Bring your self-assessment results. Ask for feedback. This is a dialogue, not a lecture." |
| Students worry about "wasting" mentor's time | Reframe: "Being prepared and engaged HONORS their time. They signed up to help—let them." |

### Activity 6: Self-Assessment Tools Introduction (10 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Introduction and rationale: 2 minutes
- Overview of 5 tools: 6 minutes
- Practical reminders: 2 minutes

#### Setup (2 minutes)

**Distribute Self-Assessment Tools handout (or ensure digital links are accessible).**

**What to say:**

"You can't plan a destination without knowing your starting point. Career planning without self-knowledge is like navigation without a map.

This course uses **five validated assessment tools** to help you understand:
- Your personality and work preferences
- Your signature strengths
- Your talents
- Your emotional intelligence
- Your career interest patterns

These aren't pop psychology quizzes. They're research-backed frameworks used by professional career counselors and organizational psychologists worldwide."

#### Overview of Five Tools (6 minutes)

**Go through each tool (about 1 minute per tool):**

**1. MBTI / 16 Personalities**

- **Measures:** Personality preferences (Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perceiving)
- **Result:** One of 16 types (e.g., INTJ, ESFP)
- **Value:** Understand work environments where you thrive, communication styles, leadership approaches
- **Access:** Free at **16personalities.com** (10-15 minutes)
- **DUE:** Before Week 2 tutorial—bring results to class

**2. VIA Character Strengths**

- **Measures:** 24 character strengths across 6 virtues
- **Result:** Top 5 "signature strengths"
- **Value:** Identify what you naturally do well; align career with authentic strengths
- **Access:** Free at **viacharacter.org** (15-20 minutes)
- **DUE:** By Week 5

**3. CliftonStrengths**

- **Measures:** 34 talent themes in 4 domains
- **Result:** Top 5 talents (e.g., Strategic, Achiever, Empathy)
- **Value:** Understand unique talent combination; learn how to develop each theme
- **Access:** **Requires access code** (provided in course materials; 30-40 minutes)
- **DUE:** By Week 5

**4. Emotional Intelligence Assessment**

- **Measures:** Self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management
- **Result:** Scores across competencies with development recommendations
- **Value:** Identify EI strengths and gaps—critical for leadership
- **Access:** Link provided in Week 7 materials (15-20 minutes)
- **DUE:** By Week 7

**5. Holland Code / RIASEC**

- **Measures:** Career interest patterns (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional)
- **Result:** 3-letter code (e.g., ASE, RIC)
- **Value:** Match career fields to genuine interests; avoid careers that will drain you
- **Access:** Free online (link provided; 10-15 minutes)
- **DUE:** By Week 5

**Emphasize integration:**

"You're not just collecting results. In your PDP, you'll write a 200-300 word integration statement identifying patterns across all five assessments.

**These work together to create a comprehensive self-portrait:**
- MBTI → how you prefer to work
- VIA → your values-based strengths
- CliftonStrengths → your talent-based strengths
- EI → your interpersonal competencies
- Holland Code → what kind of work interests you"

#### Practical Reminders (2 minutes)

**Five key points:**

**1. Answer honestly, not aspirationally**

"Don't answer how you wish you were or think you should be. Answer based on actual preferences and behaviors. The goal is self-knowledge, not high scores."

**2. Take assessments when not rushed or stressed**

"Find quiet time when you can focus. Results will be more accurate."

**3. Save your results**

"You'll need detailed results for your PDP. Take screenshots, download PDFs, or copy into a document."

**4. Reflect before sharing**

"When you get results, read carefully. What resonates? What surprises you? Bring this reflection to mentor meetings and class."

**5. Assessments are tools, not labels**

"Your MBTI type doesn't define you—it describes preferences. You can develop skills outside your natural strengths. These provide insight, not limits."

---

## Closing Reflection and Next Steps (5 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual reflection: 3 minutes
- Homework assignment: 2 minutes

#### Individual Reflection (3 minutes)

**Prompt:**

"Take 3 minutes to reflect in writing:

1. What's one insight you gained about yourself today?
2. What's one thing you're curious or nervous about as we begin this course?
3. What's one action you'll take this week related to your professional development?"

**Tutor role:**

- Write alongside students
- Maintain reflective silence
- This is NOT shared unless students volunteer

**Optional: Invite 1-2 volunteers to share insights** (only if time permits and classroom culture supports it).

#### Homework and Preparation (2 minutes)

Personal development isn't a one-time event—it's a continuous practice. You'll always be learning about yourself, setting new goals, adapting to change.

**What makes this course valuable isn't just the assessments or mentorship—it's the habits of reflection, strategic thinking, and intentional growth you'll develop.**

**See you next week. Come prepared to engage deeply.**"

## Post-Tutorial Reflection (After Class)

### Tutor Self-Assessment

**Reflect on:**

- [ ] Did students engage authentically in vulnerability-requiring activities (icebreaker, vision exercise)?
- [ ] What common fears/hopes emerged about AI and careers? (Note for future reference)
- [ ] Were there students who seemed particularly anxious or disengaged? (Follow up individually)
- [ ] Did time allocations work, or do adjustments need to be made for future tutorials?
- [ ] What questions came up that should be clarified in Week 2?

### Follow-Up Actions

**Within 48 hours:**

- [ ] Post self-assessment tools links on course management system (if not already done)
- [ ] Upload mentorship form templates
- [ ] Send email reminder about MBTI completion deadline
- [ ] Reach out individually to any students who seemed particularly anxious or disengaged

**For next week:**

- [ ] Review MBTI results students bring to class (prepare to facilitate discussion)
- [ ] Prepare examples of effective context engineering for AI (Week 2 content)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Students are reluctant to share in groups

**Causes:**
- Cultural norms around humility/privacy
- First class—haven't built trust yet
- Anxiety about judgment

**Solutions:**
- Model vulnerability yourself (share your own career uncertainties)
- Start with low-stakes sharing (icebreaker) before deeper reflection
- Emphasize: "There are no wrong answers—this is exploration, not evaluation"
- Use pair-share before small groups (less intimidating)

### Issue: Activity timing is off (running over or finishing early)

**Causes:**
- Group dynamics vary (some classes are chattier)
- Complexity of activities varies by student engagement

**Solutions:**
- **If running over:** Skip or shorten Activity 6 (self-assessment intro)—this can be covered via handout/email
- **If finishing early:** Extend pair-share discussions with additional prompts; facilitate whole-class Q&A about course structure

### Issue: Students fixate on negative (fears dominate)

**Causes:**
- Genuine anxiety about future (economically rational)
- Media coverage of AI emphasizes job loss

**Solutions:**
- Validate feelings: "Anxiety is understandable—it shows you're taking this seriously"
- Redirect to agency: "The question isn't whether change is happening—it's how YOU will prepare"
- Amplify hopes: "I'm hearing fears—what are the opportunities?"
- Ground in research: "Net +78 million jobs by 2030—jobs are changing, not disappearing"

### Issue: Students are unclear about course expectations/assessments

**Causes:**
- Information overload (lecture + tutorial + new content)
- Complex assessment structure (4 components)

**Solutions:**
- **Simplify message:** "Four assessments: (1) Reflective Essay, (2) Mentorship, (3) Personal Development Plan, (4) Oral Exam—all connected"
- Direct to Assessment Handbook: "All details are in the handbook—read it this week"
- Offer office hours: "If you're confused, come talk to me—don't wait until Week 10"

### Issue: Students ask questions you don't know the answer to

**Causes:**
- You're a tutor, not necessarily the course designer
- Specific administrative questions vary by semester

**Solutions:**
- **Be honest:** "That's a great question. I don't know the answer, but I'll find out and let you know next week."
- **Redirect to source:** "Check the Assessment Handbook—it should be there. If not, email the instructor."
- **Defer to expertise:** "That's a question for the mentorship coordinators. Here's their contact info."

## Cultural Considerations for Vietnamese Context

### Face-Saving and Humility

**Context:** Vietnamese cultural norms emphasize humility and avoiding self-promotion.

**Implication for activities:**

- Students may underrate themselves in skills assessments (cultural modesty)
- Students may hesitate to share "career dreams" that sound ambitious
- Students may avoid highlighting strengths publicly

**Tutor approach:**

- Frame self-assessment as "strategic awareness," not "bragging"
- Emphasize: "Honest self-assessment helps you develop—false modesty doesn't serve you"
- Use private reflection before public sharing (gives students permission to acknowledge strengths privately first)

### Collectivism vs. Individualism

**Context:** Vietnamese culture is more collectivist; Western career development frameworks are individualistic.

**Implication for activities:**

- Students may frame career goals around family expectations, not personal desires
- Students may feel tension between "what I want" and "what my family wants"

**Tutor approach:**

- Acknowledge this tension explicitly: "Your career can honor both your values AND your family's hopes—they don't have to conflict"
- Frame personal development as benefiting family/community: "When you develop yourself, you can contribute more to those you care about"
- Validate family considerations: "It's wise to consider your family's perspective—that's part of your values"

### English Language Proficiency Variance

**Context:** BBAE students study in English, but proficiency varies.

**Implication for activities:**

- Some students may struggle to articulate complex reflections in English
- Reading-heavy assessments (WEF report, HBR article) may be challenging for some

**Tutor approach:**

- Allow Vietnamese use in group discussions if it facilitates deeper reflection (then summarize key points in English)
- Provide vocabulary support for career/development terms
- Encourage use of Grammarly or writing support for written reflections
- Emphasize: "Ideas matter more than perfect English—communicate your thinking clearly, and we can refine language later"

## Resources and Support

### For Students Who Need Extra Support

**Students who seem anxious about career uncertainty:**
- Normalize: "Everyone feels this way—it's a sign you're taking your future seriously"
- Provide structure: "This course gives you a step-by-step process—you're not alone in this"
- Encourage mentorship: "Your mentor has navigated uncertainty too—they can help"

**Students who seem disengaged or skeptical:**
- Probe privately: "I noticed you were quiet today. What's on your mind about this course?"
- Connect to relevance: "What career questions are you wrestling with? This course should help answer those."
- Offer autonomy: "You can shape your PDP around YOUR goals—it's not one-size-fits-all"

**Students who are already highly self-aware:**
- Challenge: "You seem to have strong self-knowledge already. How can you go even deeper this semester?"
- Leverage: "Would you be willing to share insights in class discussions? Your perspective would help others."
- Stretch: "Consider using this course to explore a career path you've been curious about but haven't investigated"

### For Tutors

**If you need support:**
- **Course coordinator contact:** [Instructor name and email]
- **Mentorship coordinators:** Le Huong Lan, William Winterton Lang, Nguyễn Đức Nhật Anh, Đào Ngọc Diệp
- **Teaching resources:** Assessment Handbook, lecture slides, course readings

**Recommended reflection practice:**
- Keep your own teaching journal—note what worked, what didn't, student insights
- Debrief with other tutors if possible—share challenges and solutions
- Model the reflective practice you're teaching students
