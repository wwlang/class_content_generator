**Tutorial Title:** Career Future-Proofing Self-Assessment
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Student Deliverable:** Completed self-assessment with 12-week action plan

---

## Timing Breakdown

| Activity | Duration | Cumulative |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Quick Review (recap lecture, set success criteria) | 5 min | 5 min |
| Part 1: Self-Assessment - Five Dimensions | 30 min | 35 min |
| Part 2: Synthesis & Prioritization | 15 min | 50 min |
| Part 3: 12-Week Action Plan | 20 min | 70 min |
| Part 4: Pair Discussion | 10 min | 80 min |
| Before Next Class (review action items) | 10 min | 90 min |

**Critical Timing Notes:**
- Part 1 is the longest segment - students need full 30 minutes for thoughtful reflection
- If running behind, reduce Part 4 to 7-8 minutes rather than rushing self-assessment
- Keep Part 2 tight (15 min) - students can extend this during homework if needed
- Final 10 minutes are essential for clarity on next week's requirements

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Introduction & Quick Review (5 minutes)

**What to Do:**
1. Welcome students and acknowledge Week 1 can feel overwhelming with new course structure
2. Briefly recap the five future-proofing strategies (have students call them out):
   - Avoid predictability
   - Build relationships
   - Develop soft skills
   - Aim for originality
   - Human-AI collaboration
3. Explain today's purpose: "This isn't just an exercise. The self-assessment you complete today will directly inform your PDP, your mentorship discussions, and your development throughout the semester."
4. Set success criteria (slide 2 of tutorial): Completed self-assessment, 3 priorities identified, 12-week action plan, readiness for mentorship

**Common Student Questions:**
- **"Will this be graded?"** - No, the tutorial work itself isn't graded, but it feeds directly into graded assessments (PDP, mentorship reflections). The quality of your reflection here determines the quality of those submissions.
- **"How honest should we be?"** - Completely honest. This is FOR YOU, not for us. Inflating ratings helps no one and undermines your development plan.

**Vietnamese Context Note:**
Vietnamese students may be hesitant to identify weaknesses publicly or even privately due to "saving face" culture. Emphasize that self-awareness and acknowledging development areas is a strength in professional contexts, not a weakness. Share that successful professionals regularly identify gaps to improve.

---

### Part 1: Self-Assessment - Five Dimensions (30 minutes)

**What to Do:**
1. Explain the 1-5 rating scale: "1 is not 'bad' and 5 is not 'perfect.' Rate yourself honestly based on current evidence."
2. Walk through Strategy 1 together as an example (3-4 minutes):
   - Have a volunteer share their rating and evidence (or share your own)
   - Model the depth of reflection expected: specific examples, not vague statements
3. Release students for independent work on Strategies 2-5 (~25 minutes)
4. Circulate during independent work:
   - Check that students are providing specific evidence, not just ratings
   - Gently probe vague responses: "Can you give a specific example of that?"
   - Encourage honesty: "It's okay to rate yourself 2 or 3. That's why we're here - to develop."

**Common Student Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Rating Everything 3 (Middle)**
- **Why it happens:** Uncertainty, avoiding commitment, humility
- **How to address:** "If everything is 3, we can't identify priorities. Push yourself: Which area do you genuinely feel more confident in? Which feels more uncomfortable?"

**Challenge 2: Lack of Specific Evidence**
- **Why it happens:** Abstract thinking habit, haven't reflected deeply on experiences
- **How to address:** Ask follow-up questions: "You said you're good at communication. Tell me about a specific time when your communication skills made a difference."

**Challenge 3: Rating Based on Aspirations, Not Reality**
- **Why it happens:** Desire to be perceived well, confusion between "importance" and "current ability"
- **How to address:** "Rate where you ARE now, not where you WANT to be. We'll work on the gap throughout the semester."

**Challenge 4: Comparing to Peers Instead of Self-Assessment**
- **Why it happens:** Competitive academic environment
- **How to address:** "This isn't about being better than classmates. It's about understanding YOUR starting point so you can grow from there."

**Vietnamese Context Note:**
Students may struggle with Strategy 4 (Aim for Originality) ratings, as Vietnamese education emphasizes mastery of established knowledge over innovation. Reassure students that this is a learned capability, not an innate trait. Many successful Vietnamese entrepreneurs started risk-averse and learned to innovate.

---

### Part 2: Synthesis & Prioritization (15 minutes)

**What to Do:**
1. Have students calculate their average ratings and identify highest/lowest areas (5 min)
2. Guide pattern identification (5 min):
   - Ask 2-3 students to share their highest/lowest areas (no judgment, just data)
   - Note themes in the room: "I'm hearing several people identify networking as a weakness - that's common for university students. The good news is you have 10 weeks of mentorship to build this."
3. Priority selection (5 min):
   - Emphasize: Pick priorities based on IMPORTANCE to your career goals, not just lowest ratings
   - Example: If you want to be a software engineer, human-AI collaboration might be more critical than originality, even if originality is slightly lower rated

**Common Student Questions:**
- **"Should my top 3 priorities be my 3 lowest ratings?"** - Not necessarily. Prioritize based on career relevance and development opportunity. If you're rated 4 in soft skills but know you need to reach 5 for your target role, that might be a priority over a 3-rated area that matters less.
- **"What if I'm weak in all areas?"** - That's fine and honest. Pick the 3 that are most important for your career goals or where you see the most opportunity for growth this semester.
- **"What if I'm strong in all areas?"** - First, check your self-assessment honesty. Second, if genuinely strong, focus on pushing from 4 to 5 (mastery) in areas most critical for your career.

**Tutor Tip:**
This is where students may experience "imposter syndrome" - recognizing they have more to develop than they thought. Normalize this: "If you feel overwhelmed by how much you need to develop, that's actually a sign of growing self-awareness. It's much better to recognize this NOW in a supported environment than to discover it in a job interview."

---

### Part 3: 12-Week Action Plan (20 minutes)

**What to Do:**
1. Explain the template structure (2 min): Each priority gets 4 time blocks (Weeks 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 11-12) with specific actions
2. Provide examples of concrete vs. vague actions (3 min):
   - **Vague:** "Improve communication skills"
   - **Concrete:** "Volunteer to present in class 3 times, ask for professor feedback after each presentation"
   - **Vague:** "Network more"
   - **Concrete:** "Schedule coffee chats with 2 professionals via LinkedIn, attend NEU career fair, have substantive discussion with mentor about networking strategies"
3. Emphasize course integration (2 min): "Look at your syllabus. Where can you leverage course activities for your priorities?"
4. Release for independent work (13 min)
5. Circulate and coach:
   - Push for specificity: "By Week 7" → "By October 1"
   - Push for measurability: "Get better at" → "Complete 5 practice sessions"
   - Encourage course integration: "Have you thought about discussing this with your mentor?"

**Common Student Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Actions Too Vague**
- **Example:** "Work on originality"
- **Coaching:** "What would 'working on originality' look like? Could you propose a new approach in a group project? Could you research a business problem and brainstorm 5 different solutions?"

**Challenge 2: Actions Not Integrated with Course**
- **Example:** Student plans to "read books on emotional intelligence" but doesn't mention Week 7 (Transferable Skills & EI)
- **Coaching:** "Week 7 is all about emotional intelligence. How can you leverage that week's content for this priority?"

**Challenge 3: Actions Too Ambitious or Unrealistic**
- **Example:** "Network with 50 professionals by Week 6"
- **Coaching:** "That's admirable but might not be realistic alongside coursework. What's a challenging but achievable number? Remember quality over quantity."

**Challenge 4: No Measurement Strategy**
- **Example:** All actions listed but "How I'll measure success" is blank
- **Coaching:** "How will you know if you've succeeded? Could you track something? Get feedback from someone? Achieve a specific milestone?"

---

### Part 4: Pair Discussion (10 minutes)

**What to Do:**
1. Have students pair up (let them choose partners or assign strategically)
2. Set clear time limits: 5 minutes each to share weakest area and one commitment
3. Prompt for peer feedback: "Does your partner's plan seem realistic? What suggestions do you have?"
4. Circulate and listen to discussions - intervene only if pairs are off-track or stuck

**What to Listen For:**
- Are students being vulnerable and honest about weaknesses?
- Are they giving constructive feedback or just being polite?
- Are accountability mechanisms emerging? (e.g., "Let's check in mid-semester")

**Vietnamese Context Note:**
Vietnamese students may be uncomfortable sharing weaknesses even with peers. If you sense reluctance, frame it differently: "Share an area where you see big opportunity for growth" or "Share which future-proofing strategy you're most excited to develop."

**Tutor Intervention Examples:**
- **If pair is too surface-level:** "I'm hearing general discussion. Can you get specific? What's the ONE action your partner will take in the next two weeks?"
- **If pair lacks peer feedback:** "Partner, do you think that action plan will actually help with the weakness identified? What would you suggest?"

---

### Before Next Class (10 minutes)

**What to Do:**
1. Review the three required action items (slide or handout):
   - Complete Week 1 quiz on Moodle
   - Read Clark & Chamorro-Premuzic HBR article
   - Experiment with an AI tool
2. Emphasize the AI experiment: "This isn't optional extra credit. Week 2 assumes you've actually USED an AI tool. Come with real observations."
3. Remind about saving their work: "Your self-assessment and action plan are valuable documents. Keep them somewhere safe. You'll reference them in your PDP."
4. Optional mentorship prompt: "If your mentorship starts Week 2, consider sharing your future-proofing priorities with your mentor as a great discussion starter."

**Common Student Questions:**
- **"Which AI tool should we use?"** - Any of the free ones: ChatGPT (chat.openai.com), Gemini (gemini.google.com), or Claude (claude.ai). All have free tiers. Pick whichever interface you like best.
- **"What task should we try with AI?"** - Use it for something REAL, not artificial. Could be: drafting an email, summarizing a reading for another class, brainstorming ideas for a project, getting feedback on writing. The key is to critically evaluate the output.
- **"Is the Week 1 quiz hard?"** - It's straightforward if you paid attention in lecture and review the slides. It covers the key concepts: WEF findings, Vietnam labor market, five future-proofing strategies.

## Common Misconceptions & How to Address

### Misconception 1: "I need to be strong in all five areas"
**Reality:** No one is strong in everything. Strategic career success comes from leveraging your unique strengths and developing critical weaknesses, not achieving 5/5 across the board.

**How to address:** "Think about successful people you admire. Are they perfect in all five areas? Probably not. They're exceptional in 2-3 areas and competent in the others. Your goal is strategic development, not perfection."

---

### Misconception 2: "My rating doesn't matter because it's just self-assessment"
**Reality:** Self-awareness is the foundation of professional development. Inaccurate self-assessment leads to misguided development efforts and wasted time.

**How to address:** "Research shows that self-awareness is one of the strongest predictors of leadership success. The ability to accurately assess yourself is itself a valuable skill. Companies use 360-degree feedback because self-assessment alone can be biased - that's why you'll also get mentor and peer feedback throughout the semester."

---

### Misconception 3: "I'll develop these skills naturally through experience"
**Reality:** Deliberate, focused development is far more effective than hoping skills emerge naturally. Without intentional practice and reflection, experience can actually reinforce bad habits.

**How to address:** "Kolb's experiential learning cycle - which we'll study in Week 3 - shows that experience alone doesn't guarantee learning. You need experience PLUS reflection PLUS conceptual understanding PLUS active experimentation. That's what your action plan provides."

---

### Misconception 4: "Soft skills aren't as important as technical skills"
**Reality:** In the AI era, technical skills become table stakes while soft skills become key differentiators. Vietnamese employers specifically report soft skill gaps as their biggest hiring challenge.

**How to address:** "The World Bank survey of Vietnamese employers found that technical skills are generally adequate, but cognitive and behavioral skills are critically lacking. That's YOUR opportunity. Two business students with the same GPA - the one with proven communication, teamwork, and adaptability skills will get the job and promotion."

---

### Misconception 5: "I should pick priorities based on what sounds impressive"
**Reality:** Authentic development aligned with your genuine goals and weaknesses is far more valuable than performative development that sounds good but doesn't create real growth.

**How to address:** "This is FOR YOU, not for us. If you pick priorities because they sound good but you don't actually work on them, you've wasted a semester of development opportunity. Your career will benefit from real growth in areas that matter to YOUR goals, not impressive-sounding areas that don't connect to your actual path."

---

## Cultural Context for Vietnamese Students

### Face-Saving Considerations
- Vietnamese students may be reluctant to publicly acknowledge weaknesses
- Frame development needs as "opportunities for growth" rather than "weaknesses"
- Emphasize that successful professionals actively seek development, viewing it as strength not weakness
- Allow written reflection as primary mode rather than forcing verbal sharing of vulnerable content

### Hierarchical vs. Collaborative Learning
- Vietnamese education traditionally emphasizes teacher authority and student deference
- This tutorial requires student autonomy and self-direction, which may feel uncomfortable initially
- Explicitly give permission: "There are no right or wrong answers in self-assessment, only honest or dishonest ones"
- Position yourself as facilitator/coach rather than evaluator during the tutorial

### Risk Aversion and Innovation
- Strategy 4 (Aim for Originality) may be particularly challenging
- Vietnamese students often trained to master established knowledge rather than innovate
- Cultural pressure toward conformity and "safe" career choices
- Acknowledge this: "Vietnamese education does excellent job teaching mastery, but innovation is learned differently"
- Share examples of successful Vietnamese innovators/entrepreneurs as role models

### Relationship Building (Quan Hệ)
- Vietnamese culture already values relationships highly in business (quan hệ)
- Students may rate themselves high on Strategy 2 based on social skills
- Distinguish: social networking vs. professional strategic networking
- Emphasize: "You're good at building relationships in social contexts. How do you translate that skill to professional contexts with intentionality?"

### Mentorship Cultural Fit
- Mentorship aligns well with Vietnamese respect for elders and learning from experienced professionals
- Students may be very deferential to mentors - encourage them to ask questions and engage actively
- Frame mentorship as mutual benefit, not one-way hierarchy

---

## Troubleshooting Common Tutorial Issues

### Issue 1: Students Finish Part 1 Much Faster Than 30 Minutes
**Why it happens:** Surface-level reflection, rushing through, avoiding depth
**How to address:**
- Check their work - are evidence sections substantive or one-sentence?
- Ask probing questions: "You rated yourself 4 on communication. What specific evidence supports that? Can you describe a situation where your communication skills made a concrete difference?"
- Extend activity: "Now that you've completed first pass, go back and add TWO specific examples for your highest and lowest rated areas."

### Issue 2: Student Seems Overwhelmed or Distressed
**Why it happens:** Realization of skill gaps, comparison to peers, perfectionism, anxiety about career uncertainty
**How to address:**
- Private conversation: "I notice you seem concerned. What's coming up for you?"
- Normalize: "Feeling overwhelmed when you realize areas for development is actually a sign of growing self-awareness. Every successful professional has been exactly where you are."
- Reframe: "You have 12 weeks of structured support to work on these priorities. You're not alone in this."
- If significant distress: Refer to university counseling services

### Issue 3: Student Rates Everything Very High (4-5 Across the Board)
**Why it happens:** Lack of self-awareness, overconfidence, desire to appear competent, misunderstanding scale
**How to address:**
- Gentle challenge: "It's great that you feel confident. Can you tell me about a situation where your [skill] was tested? What was challenging about it?"
- Reframe scale: "5 means you're operating at professional level that would be recognized by others as exemplary. Most university students are developing toward that. Does 5 still feel accurate?"
- Suggest: "What if you think about ratings as 'room for growth' rather than current level? Where is there MOST room for growth?"

### Issue 4: Student Rates Everything Very Low (1-2 Across the Board)
**Why it happens:** Imposter syndrome, perfectionism, harsh self-criticism, depression, cultural humility
**How to address:**
- Validate feelings: "It's common to feel like you have a lot to develop. That's why you're in university."
- Seek evidence: "You said 1 for communication. But you're communicating with me right now clearly. Can you think of a situation where your communication actually worked well?"
- Reframe: "1 means you avoid this entirely and have no capability. Is that really accurate? Or are you developing capability but not at expert level yet?"
- Build from strengths: "Let's identify at least ONE area where you have some foundation to build from."

### Issue 5: Student Creates Vague or Unrealistic Action Plan
**Why it happens:** Lack of planning experience, unclear on specificity needed, overwhelming amount to develop
**How to address:**
- Use SMART framework: "Let's make this goal SMART. It says 'improve networking.' How could we make that Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound?"
- Scale down: "Connecting with 50 professionals in 4 weeks is ambitious. What's a more realistic number that would still represent real progress?"
- Connect to course: "Look at your syllabus. You have a mentorship program, field trip, guest speaker. How can those activities support this priority?"

---

## Extension Activities (If Time Permits or for Advanced Students)

### Extension 1: Peer Accountability Partnership
If pair discussions go well and students want deeper accountability, facilitate forming "development partners" who will check in weekly on progress toward action plans. Provide a simple weekly check-in template.

### Extension 2: Mentor Meeting 1 Preparation
For students starting mentorship next week, spend 5-10 extra minutes helping them prepare discussion topics based on their self-assessment. What would they most value learning from their mentor related to their priorities?

### Extension 3: Career Field Research
Have students spend 10-15 additional minutes researching which of the five future-proofing strategies matters MOST for their target career field. Does an aspiring data analyst need different priorities than someone pursuing HR management?

### Extension 4: Resources for Self-Development
Compile and share resources for common priorities:
- **Communication/soft skills:** Toastmasters, NEU clubs, online courses (Coursera Communication Skills)
- **AI tools:** Tutorials for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini prompt engineering
- **Networking:** LinkedIn Learning courses on professional networking
- **Originality/Innovation:** Stanford d.school resources on design thinking

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

### Immediate (Within 24 Hours)
- Upload tutorial slides/materials to Moodle if not already available
- Send brief email reminder about Week 2 action items (quiz, reading, AI experiment)
- Note any students who seemed particularly struggling - consider reaching out individually

### Within One Week
- Review a sample of completed self-assessments if students submitted them (optional)
- Identify common patterns to inform future tutorials or lecture emphasis
- Prepare Week 2 tutorial with awareness of Week 1 challenges

### Mid-Semester (Week 6-7)
- Optional: Send email asking students to revisit their Week 1 action plans
- Prompt reflection: "Are you making progress on your three priorities? What adjustments do you need?"
- This reinforces that Week 1 work isn't just a one-time exercise

---

## Alignment with Course Assessments

### Personal Development Plan (40%)
**How this tutorial supports:** Students' self-assessment ratings directly inform their SWOT analysis weaknesses section. Their action plans provide evidence of development strategies. Progress on priorities throughout semester becomes narrative of growth for PDP reflection section.

### Mentorship Program (20%)
**How this tutorial supports:** Priorities identified today become discussion topics for mentorship meetings. Pre-meeting forms can reference development goals. Post-meeting reflections can document mentor advice on priorities. Final mentorship portfolio includes progress on Week 1 priorities.

### Reflective Essay (10%)
**How this tutorial supports:** Practice in self-assessment and identifying development needs prepares students for critical reflection on field trip and guest speaker. Understanding of what "development areas" look like improves quality of reflective analysis.

### Final Oral Exam (30%)
**How this tutorial supports:** Students who worked authentically on Week 1 priorities have genuine growth story to tell in oral presentation. Evidence of developing from identified weaknesses demonstrates strategic self-management.

---

## Success Indicators for This Tutorial

**You'll know the tutorial was successful if:**
- Students leave with completed self-assessments containing specific evidence (not just ratings)
- At least 80% of students identified 3 distinct priorities (not just "everything")
- Action plans include concrete, dated actions (not vague intentions)
- Students connected their priorities to course activities and assessments
- Pair discussions were substantive (you overheard specific development plans being discussed)
- Students left understanding Week 2 action items clearly

**Red flags that tutorial needs adjustment:**
- Students finished in 60 minutes instead of 90 (rushing, surface-level work)
- Self-assessments are mostly 3s with no differentiation
- Action plans are vague or generic ("work harder on X")
- Students unclear on how today's work connects to graded assessments
- Defensive reactions to identifying weaknesses (cultural sensitivity needed)

---

Students who engage authentically with self-assessment today will have richer mentorship discussions, more strategic PDPs, and more confident oral exams. Your role is to create safe space for honest self-evaluation and provide coaching toward specificity and realism in action planning.
