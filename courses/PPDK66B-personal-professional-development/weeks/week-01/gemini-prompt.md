# 40%

**of the skills you're learning right now will be obsolete or fundamentally different within 5 years**

*(World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs Report 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
Key moment—this statistic surprises students every time. Based on WEF surveys of over 1,000 employers representing 14 million workers globally. By 2030, when these students are establishing careers, 40% of core job skills will have changed. This isn't about fear-mongering; it's about preparing them for reality. Students typically react with both anxiety and curiosity. The follow-up question frames the entire course: if skills become obsolete, what remains valuable? Answer: The capacity to continuously learn, adapt, and develop yourself.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="2" layout="section-break" title="Course Purpose">

# Personal & Professional Development

## Why This Course Matters in the AI Era

Today's professionals need:
- **Continuous self-development**
- **Ability to adapt to change**
- **Navigate uncertainty with clarity**

<speaker-notes>
This connects the hook to the course structure. The old career playbook—study hard, get a job, stay loyal, retire—no longer applies in Vietnam or globally. Over 12 weeks, students will complete validated self-assessments, work with professional mentors, reflect on real workplace experiences, and create a comprehensive 5-year development plan. This isn't academic theory; it's the foundation for career resilience.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Analyze** how AI and automation reshape career opportunities
2. **Identify** key trends in the Vietnamese labor market
3. **Evaluate** personal development frameworks for career uncertainty
4. **Connect** course assessments to your professional journey

<speaker-notes>
These objectives map directly to what employers seek: analytical thinking, contextual awareness, strategic planning, and integration. Students should understand that each objective builds toward their Personal Development Plan (40% of grade). Common question: "How does Week 1 connect to the final exam?" Answer: You'll present your PDP orally in the exam period, and the frameworks introduced today provide structure.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" layout="content" title="Roadmap">

## Today's Journey

1. **The Future of Work** — Global trends reshaping careers (25 min)
2. **The Vietnamese Context** — Your specific career landscape (20 min)
3. **Development Frameworks** — How to navigate uncertainty (20 min)
4. **Course Structure** — How assessments build your career (15 min)
5. **Next Steps** — What to do after today (10 min)

<speaker-notes>
This roadmap moves from global to local to personal—a pedagogical pattern that helps students contextualize abstract concepts. The timing shows we'll spend most energy on understanding the landscape (45 minutes) before introducing frameworks. This prevents the common mistake of jumping to tools without understanding why they matter.

<slide number="5" layout="section-break" title="Section 1: Future of Work">

# SECTION 1

## The Future of Work
### Why Personal Development Matters Now More Than Ever

*(25 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
This section establishes urgency. Why invest in personal development when you could be learning technical skills? Because technical skills have a half-life of 3-5 years, while meta-skills (learning, adaptation, self-awareness) compound over decades. The WEF video provides third-party credibility; students trust external authorities more than instructors initially.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="content" title="WEF Video">

**[VIDEO: WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 Summary]**
**Video link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKTJp2y_lT4
**Duration:** 3 minutes

**Before watching:** "What industries do you think will create the most jobs by 2030?"

<speaker-notes>
Pre-viewing questions activate prior knowledge. After the video, debrief quickly: "What surprised you?" Common student insights: "I didn't know AI would create MORE jobs than it destroys" or "Healthcare and renewable energy are bigger than tech." The video frames job displacement as a transition challenge, not apocalypse—this reframes student anxiety productively.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="content" title="Global Jobs Forecast">

## The Net-Positive Story (With a Twist)

**By 2030:**
- **+170 million** new jobs created
- **-92 million** jobs displaced by technology
- **= +78 million** net new jobs globally

**The twist:** This assumes workers can successfully *transition* from declining roles to emerging roles.

**The question isn't whether jobs will exist—it's whether YOU will have the skills to access them.**

<speaker-notes>
This slide reframes the WEF data to highlight the critical assumption: successful transitions require intentional skill development. Many students miss this nuance—they see "78 million net jobs" and feel reassured. Push them: "What if you're in a declining role and lack skills for emerging roles?" This motivates engagement with course content. The phrasing "whether YOU will have the skills" makes it personal, not abstract.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Growing vs Declining Roles">

## Fastest-Growing Jobs by 2030

| **Growing** | **Declining** |
|-------------|---------------|
| AI & ML Specialists | Bank Tellers |
| Data Scientists | Postal Clerks |
| Cybersecurity Pros | Data Entry Clerks |
| FinTech Engineers | Admin Assistants |
| Renewable Energy | Cashiers |
| Digital Marketing | Ticket Clerks |

**Pattern:** Routine tasks decline. Judgment, creativity, and human connection grow.

<speaker-notes>
Students relate to this breakdown immediately—they can visualize these jobs. Key teaching point: Notice the pattern, not just individual jobs. Routine, predictable tasks are declining (automatable). Roles requiring creativity, judgment, complex problem-solving, and human interaction are growing. This isn't about technology replacing humans; it's about technology replacing ROUTINE TASKS. Common student question: "What if I like routine work?" Valid question—acknowledge that preference, but help them see career risk.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="9" layout="content" title="Top 10 Skills for 2030">

## The Skills Employers Will Prioritize

1. Analytical thinking and innovation
2. Active learning and learning strategies
3. Creativity, originality, and initiative
4. Technology design and programming
5. Critical thinking and analysis
6. Complex problem-solving
7. Leadership and social influence
8. **Emotional intelligence**
9. **Resilience and flexibility**
10. AI and big data literacy

*(WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
Have students identify their top 2 current strengths and top 2 development needs—this personalizes the list. Key observation: Notice what's NOT on this list (memorizing facts, following procedures, technical knowledge alone). The bolded skills (#8-9) are uniquely human and can't be automated. Students often overlook these "soft skills" as less important; this data contradicts that assumption. Connection: "This is where personal development comes in—technical skills change every few years, but strong analytical thinking, emotional intelligence, and learning strategies let you adapt to ANY technological shift."

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="Future-Proofing Strategies">

## 5 Strategies to Future-Proof Your Career

*(Clark & Chamorro-Premuzic, HBR 2023)*

1. **Avoid Predictability** — If AI can learn your job, it will
2. **Build Human Relationships** — Trust and empathy can't be automated
3. **Develop Soft Skills Ruthlessly** — The hardest skills to automate
4. **Aim for Originality** — Don't compete on efficiency
5. **Develop AI Collaboration** — Work WITH AI, not against it

<speaker-notes>
Harvard Business Review framework provides practical guidance. Strategy #1 surprises students: if your work is routine and predictable, AI WILL learn it—so seek non-routine, contextual judgment work. Strategy #3: "Soft skills" is a terrible term (implies less important); these are actually the HARDEST to automate. Strategy #5 will be explored deeply in Week 2. Common student reflection: "Which strategy feels most urgent for MY development?" Let them self-assess before moving on.

<slide number="11" layout="section-break" title="Section 2: Vietnamese Context">

# SECTION 2

## The Vietnamese Context
### Your Career Landscape

*(20 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
This transition is critical—students need to see how global trends manifest in Vietnam specifically. Many students feel intimidated by global data; grounding in local context makes it actionable. Vietnam's economy has transformed rapidly since Đổi Mới (1986), creating unique opportunities and challenges that students will navigate.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Economic Transformation">

## From Agricultural to Digital Economy

**Since Đổi Mới (1986):**

| Year | Agriculture Employment |
|------|----------------------|
| 1986 | >70% |
| 2024 | <40% |

**Today's Vietnam:**
- Growing services sector
- Manufacturing hub
- Emerging tech ecosystem

*You are part of the generation shaping this transformation.*

<speaker-notes>
The shift from 70% to under 40% agricultural employment in less than 40 years is remarkable—Vietnam compressed what took Western economies 150+ years. Students are beneficiaries of this transformation (access to higher education, diverse career options) but also face pressure to capitalize on opportunities their parents couldn't access. Acknowledge this dual reality. The "you are part of" framing emphasizes agency—they're not passive recipients but active shapers of Vietnam's future economy.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="Skills Gap">

## The Paradox: Abundant Workers, Scarce Skills

**Deloitte 2024 Global Human Capital Trends (Vietnam):**

**Cognitive Skills Shortage:**
- Problem-solving
- Critical thinking
- Analytical reasoning

**Behavioral Skills Shortage:**
- Teamwork and collaboration
- Communication (especially English)
- Adaptability and learning agility

<speaker-notes>
This is the paradox students need to grasp: Vietnam has abundant working-age population (demographic dividend), but employers consistently report difficulty finding workers with the RIGHT skills. This isn't about credential inflation; it's about genuine skill gaps. If students develop these EXACT skills—cognitive and behavioral competencies—they become highly competitive in Vietnam's market. This data is locally validated by employer surveys, not just imported Western research.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="High-Demand Careers">

## Current High-Demand Roles (2024)

- **Data Engineers & AI Specialists**
- **Cybersecurity Experts**
- **Digital Marketing & E-commerce**
- **FinTech & Financial Analysts**
- **Semiconductor/Chip Design Engineers**
- **Supply Chain & Logistics Managers**

**Context:** 70%+ of Vietnam's workforce are untrained workers (no degree). Only 28.1% have degrees or professional certificates.

<speaker-notes>
By earning a BBAE degree, students are already in the top 30% by educational attainment. But this advantage only translates to success if they ALSO develop transferable skills highlighted in Slide 13. The semiconductor point is timely—major investments from Intel, Samsung creating new opportunities in high-tech manufacturing. Students should understand these roles reflect global trends (AI, fintech) adapted to Vietnam's specific economy (manufacturing hub, e-commerce growth with rising middle class).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="content" title="Mega-Trends">

## 3 Mega-Trends Affecting Vietnam's Labor Market

*(Deloitte 2024)*

1. **Rising Asian Consumer Class**
   - Retail, e-commerce, financial services, entertainment

2. **Automation & Technology**
   - Robots handle routine assembly; humans manage quality, optimization

3. **Aging Population**
   - By 2040: healthcare, retirement planning, automation needs

**Strategic question:** Which of these aligns with YOUR career interests?

<speaker-notes>
These mega-trends operate on 10-20 year timescales, shaping career opportunities throughout students' working lives. Trend #1: Vietnam's rising middle class creates demand in consumer-facing industries. Trend #2: Automation in manufacturing doesn't eliminate jobs; it CHANGES them (fewer assembly workers, more quality control and process optimization roles). Trend #3: Vietnam's demographic dividend won't last forever—aging population by 2040 means healthcare and planning needs will grow substantially. Students should self-assess: Which trend excites them? This informs later career goal-setting.

<slide number="16" layout="section-break" title="Section 3: Development Frameworks">

# SECTION 3

## Personal & Career Development Frameworks
### How to Navigate Uncertainty

*(20 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "Now that you understand the landscape, how do you actually NAVIGATE it? You need a framework—not just motivation." Many students approach career development reactively (apply when desperate, learn when forced). Frameworks provide structure, strategy, systems, and adaptability for proactive development.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Why Frameworks">

## Reactive vs. Framework-Driven Development

**Reactive approach:**
- Apply to jobs when you need money
- Take training when employers require it
- Make decisions based on immediate pressures

**This worked in stable career environments. It fails in dynamic ones.**

**Framework-driven approach:**
- **Structure** for understanding yourself
- **Strategy** for setting goals
- **Systems** for tracking progress
- **Adaptability** when circumstances change

<speaker-notes>
Most students have been reactive their entire lives—studying what's assigned, taking required courses, following prescribed paths. This worked in stable environments where career ladders were predictable. It FAILS in dynamic environments where skills obsolete rapidly and career paths are non-linear. Framework-driven development means: (1) Structure for self-understanding (assessments), (2) Strategy for goal-setting (SMART goals), (3) Systems for tracking progress (reflection, metrics), (4) Adaptability when plans change (which they will). This is what students will build across 12 weeks.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="framework" title="PDP Framework">

## Your PDP Framework (40% of Grade)

**1. Foundation: Self-Knowledge**
- MBTI, VIA Strengths, CliftonStrengths
- Emotional Intelligence Assessment
- Holland Code (RIASEC)

**2. Integration: SWOT Analysis**
- Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

**3. Vision: 50-Word Statement**
- Core values, definition of success, desired impact

**4. Strategy: SMART Goals**
- 1-year, 3-year, 5-year goals

**5. Implementation: Action Plan**
- Monthly/quarterly/annual milestones

<speaker-notes>
This is the architecture students will build. Walk through each component: (1) Foundation—you can't plan without knowing your starting point; multiple validated assessments provide triangulated self-knowledge. (2) Integration—SWOT analysis synthesizes assessments with reality check from mentor. (3) Vision—50-word constraint forces clarity; students can't be vague. (4) Strategy—SMART goals at three timeframes create short-term action and long-term direction. (5) Implementation—breaking goals into concrete steps with timelines and accountability. This framework will be referenced throughout the course.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="content" title="Mentorship Component">

## Learning from Experience (20% of Grade)

**Unique to this course:** One-on-one with experienced business professional for 10 weeks

**Research shows mentored professionals:**
- Advance faster in careers
- Earn higher salaries
- Report greater job satisfaction
- Build stronger networks

**Program Structure:**
- 4 required meetings (minimum 2 face-to-face)
- Pre-meeting preparation (48 hours before)
- Post-meeting reflection (48 hours after)
- Integration into your PDP

<speaker-notes>
The mentorship program is what distinguishes this course from typical career development classes. Research on mentorship is robust—mentored professionals consistently outperform non-mentored peers on career outcomes. But this requires ACTIVE engagement, not passive advice-receiving. Students bring self-assessment results, career questions, and draft plans. Mentors share experience, challenge assumptions, provide guidance. The 48-hour documentation windows ensure students reflect while memory is fresh. Connection to PDP: mentor insights must be integrated throughout, especially in SWOT and goal-setting sections.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Reflective Learning">

## The Secret to Accelerated Growth (10% of Grade)

**Truth about learning:**
Experience alone doesn't create wisdom. **Reflected-upon experience** creates wisdom.

**Example:** Two students attend the same field trip:
- **Student A:** Takes notes, writes surface-level summary
- **Student B:** Applies Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, analyzes observations, connects to course concepts, creates action plan

**Who learns more? Who develops faster?**

**Reflective frameworks you'll learn:**
- Gibbs' Reflective Cycle
- Kolb's Experiential Learning
- Driscoll & Bolton's Model

<speaker-notes>
Experience without reflection equals limited learning. This is why some people have "10 years of experience" while others have "1 year repeated 10 times." Student A's approach is what most students do naturally—document but don't analyze. Student B's approach transforms experience into wisdom through structured reflection. Week 3 will teach these frameworks in depth; introducing them now plants seeds. The 10% Reflective Essay grade might seem small, but the SKILL of reflection amplifies learning in every other assessment and throughout students' careers.

## Course Structure & Assessment Alignment
### How This Course Prepares You

*(15 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Students need to see the forest, not just trees. How do 12 weeks and 4 assessments work together to prepare them for career success? This section provides the overarching structure so they understand why each week matters.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="content" title="12-Week Journey">

## Course Overview

**Weeks 1-2:** Understanding the Landscape
- Future of work, AI-era career skills

**Weeks 3-5:** Building Self-Knowledge
- Reflective learning, self-managed learning, assessments

**Week 6:** Field Trip — MISA Company

**Weeks 7-9:** Developing Essential Competencies
- Transferable skills, time management, growth mindset

**Week 10:** Guest Speaker — Ms. Ha Linh

**Weeks 11-12:** Integration & Planning
- Personal Development Plan, course synthesis

<speaker-notes>
This progression is intentional: Weeks 1-2 establish WHY development matters. Weeks 3-5 build the TOOLS for development (reflection, self-management, self-assessment). Week 6 provides real-world data through field trip. Weeks 7-9 develop specific COMPETENCIES (EI, time management, mindset). Week 10 provides another real-world data point (guest speaker). Weeks 11-12 INTEGRATE everything into the PDP. Students should understand: nothing is random; each week builds on previous weeks.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="framework" title="Assessment Progression">

## Assessment Progression

**1. Reflective Essay (10%)**
Demonstrates you can **analyze experiences** and extract career insights

**2. Mentorship Program (20%)**
Demonstrates you can **seek guidance**, build professional relationships

**3. Personal Development Plan (40%)**
Demonstrates you can **synthesize self-knowledge** into strategic goals

**4. Final Oral Exam (30%)**
Demonstrates you can **communicate your vision** professionally

**Each assessment builds on the previous one.**

<speaker-notes>
The assessment progression is carefully scaffolded. Reflective Essay (10%): Analyzes two experiences (field trip + guest speaker) using frameworks from Week 3. Mentorship Program (20%): 10 weeks of structured guidance; reflections from meetings inform PDP. Personal Development Plan (40%): The capstone—integrates assessments, mentor feedback, course concepts into 5-year roadmap. Final Oral Exam (30%): Present PDP professionally, demonstrating both content mastery and communication skill. Students aren't completing isolated assignments; they're building an integrated career development system.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Connection to Career">

## Why This Matters Beyond Grades

**In your first job interview, you'll be asked:**
- "Tell me about yourself."
- "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"
- "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
- "Why are you interested in this role?"

**Without intentional self-development:**
- Generic, unconvincing answers
- Unclear if job aligns with your values
- Struggle to articulate unique value

**With the work you do in this course:**
- Compelling personal narrative backed by assessments
- Clear understanding of strengths, values, direction
- Professional self-presentation

<speaker-notes>
This makes the course immediately practical. Every student will face these interview questions—most give terrible answers because they haven't done the self-work. "Tell me about yourself" stumps students who haven't clarified their narrative. "Strengths and weaknesses" gets generic responses ("I'm a perfectionist!") from those without assessment data. "5-year vision" is blank for those without strategic planning. The PDP isn't just a course assignment; it's interview preparation, career roadmap, and decision-making framework. Students who complete this course authentically will outperform peers in job applications.

## Mark Your Calendar

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| September 18 | Field Trip to MISA Company (mandatory) |
| September 23 | Mentorship Program begins |
| October 16 | Guest Speaker: Ms. Ha Linh (mandatory) |

**Mentorship deadlines:**
- Pre-meeting forms: 48 hours before
- Post-meeting reflections: 48 hours after

**Late policy:** 10% penalty per day

<speaker-notes>
Have students write these dates in their planners NOW. Field trip and guest speaker are MANDATORY—required for Reflective Essay. Mentorship begins Week 2 and runs 10 weeks. PDP due Week 11 gives one week cushion before exam period. The 48-hour documentation windows for mentorship are strict—students who miss deadlines lose points. Late policy is real and enforced; procrastination will damage grades. Setting these expectations clearly Week 1 prevents problems Week 11.

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Tutorial Preview">

## What Happens in Tutorial Today

1. **Icebreaker activity** — Build classroom community
2. **AI & career futures discussion** — Small group dialogue
3. **Skills self-assessment** — Reflect on current strengths
4. **Career vision brainstorming** — Begin thinking about 5-year direction
5. **Mentorship program orientation** — Expectations and first meeting prep
6. **Self-assessment tools intro** — Overview of MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths

**Come ready to participate actively.**

<speaker-notes>
Tutorial is where lecture concepts become practice. Icebreaker builds trust—personal development requires vulnerability, which requires safety. Skills self-assessment activates prior knowledge before formal assessments. Career vision brainstorming starts students thinking about goals before Week 11 deadline. Mentorship orientation ensures students understand expectations before first meeting. Self-assessment intro previews Week 5 tools. Emphasize: Tutorial is NOT lecture part 2; it's active engagement.

## Required Actions

1. **Read all three required readings:**
   - WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025
   - Clark & Chamorro-Premuzic (HBR 2023)
   - Deloitte 2024 Global Human Capital Trends

2. **Complete MBTI assessment** (16personalities.com)
   - Bring results to Week 2 tutorial

3. **Begin reflective journal** (recommended)
   - Keep notes on insights, questions, realizations

4. **Prepare for mentor pairing**
   - Draft 2-3 questions for a professional mentor

<speaker-notes>
These aren't optional suggestions; they're requirements. All three readings are accessible (no paywall) and directly support Week 2 discussions. MBTI completion before Week 2 tutorial enables hands-on interpretation. Reflective journal is recommended but not required—students who maintain one find Reflective Essay much easier to write. Mentor preparation questions help students approach first meeting strategically rather than passively. Hold students accountable: "These tasks prepare YOU for success—don't shortchange yourself by skipping them."

## From Terrifying to Liberating

**40% of job skills will change by 2030.**

**Terrifying if:** You see your education as a fixed set of knowledge that will become obsolete.

**Liberating if:** You see your education as developing the *capacity to continuously learn, adapt, and grow*—skills that never become obsolete.

**This course chooses liberation.**

<speaker-notes>
Circle back to the opening hook with reframing. The same statistic that seemed threatening now seems empowering. Fixed mindset (Week 9 concept, seed it now): Education = acquiring knowledge → obsolescence is terrifying. Growth mindset: Education = developing capacity → adaptation is liberating. This course develops meta-skills that compound over a lifetime. Students will still feel anxious (natural), but they now have framework for channeling anxiety into productive action.

<speaker-notes>
End with inspiration grounded in concrete action. The five verbs (discover, learn, reflect, create, present) summarize the course arc. "Not preparing for a job" reframes student thinking—many are focused narrowly on first job placement. This course is about career resilience across decades. "Starts right now" emphasizes immediate agency—they're not waiting for permission or future circumstances. Pause after final line. Let it land. Then dismiss to tutorial with energy: "See you in tutorial. Come ready to engage."
