# Week 3 Tutorial: Reflection Practice Workshop

**Course:** PPDK66B - Personal & Professional Development
**Duration:** 90 minutes

---

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Reflection ≠ Thinking:** Structured reflection using frameworks (Gibbs/Kolb/Driscoll) transforms experiences into learning; passive thinking doesn't
- **Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (6 stages):** Description → Feelings → Evaluation → Analysis → Conclusion → Action Plan (best for complex, emotional experiences)
- **Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (4 stages):** Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation (best for continuous skill development)
- **Driscoll's Model (3 questions):** What? So What? Now What? (best for quick debriefs like mentor meetings)
- **Reflection Depth Levels:** Level 1 (Description only) vs. Level 2 (Analysis with theory) vs. Level 3 (Transformation with specific action) — aim for Level 3

**What good work looks like:**
- Framework correctly applied (all stages/questions addressed, not just mentioned once)
- Level 3 depth achieved (moves beyond description to show behavior change)
- At least one course concept explicitly referenced (e.g., Goleman's EI, growth mindset, Covey's habits)
- Specific, measurable action plan (not vague intentions like "try harder")
- Honest vulnerability (admitting surprises, mistakes, or challenged assumptions)

## Main Activity: Guided Reflection Workshop

**Assessment Connection:** Reflective Essay (10%, Due after Week 10) - This activity provides hands-on practice applying Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll frameworks to prepare you for the 1,500-word field trip + guest speaker reflection.

### The Task

Write a 200-word structured reflection on ONE experience from the past two weeks of this course. This is scaled practice for your Reflective Essay—same frameworks, same depth expectations, shorter length.

### Choose Your Experience (Pick ONE)

Select a meaningful moment from Weeks 1-2:

**Option A: First Mentor Meeting**
- What happened during the meeting?
- What surprised you about your mentor's advice or career journey?
- How did it challenge your assumptions about career paths?

**Option B: Self-Assessment Results**
- MBTI, VIA Character Strengths, Learning Styles, or Holland Code
- What surprised you about your results?
- Did results confirm or contradict your self-perception?

**Option C: Week 1 or Week 2 Lecture Insight**
- A concept that challenged your thinking (AI impact on careers, context engineering, future skills)
- A moment when you disagreed with or questioned course content
- A connection you made between lecture and your own experience

**Option D: Course Registration / Career Decision**
- Why you chose this program or course
- A recent career decision you made (or struggled with)
- Uncertainty about your professional path

**Why these experiences?** They're recent (memory is fresh), meaningful (involve your development), and complex enough to practice deep reflection.

### Choose Your Framework (Pick ONE)

You'll use ONE of the three frameworks from today's lecture:

**Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (6 stages):**
1. Description - What happened?
2. Feelings - What were you thinking/feeling?
3. Evaluation - What was good/bad?
4. Analysis - Why did it happen this way?
5. Conclusion - What else could you have done?
6. Action Plan - What will you do next?

**Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (4 stages):**
1. Concrete Experience - The event
2. Reflective Observation - Multiple perspectives
3. Abstract Conceptualization - Theory/insights
4. Active Experimentation - What you'll test

**Driscoll's Model (3 questions):**
1. WHAT? - What happened?
2. SO WHAT? - Why does it matter?
3. NOW WHAT? - What will you do?

**Framework Selection Tips:**
- **Gibbs** if your experience involved strong emotions or was complex
- **Kolb** if you're developing a skill you'll practice repeatedly
- **Driscoll** if you want to practice quick, efficient reflection (mentor meeting format)

### Deliverable

**200-word reflection** (±20 words acceptable) that:
- Clearly identifies which framework you're using
- Addresses all stages/questions of your chosen framework
- Reaches Level 3 depth (transformation, not just description)
- References at least ONE course concept from Weeks 1-3
- Includes a specific action plan with measurable outcome

**Format:**
- Start with: "Framework: [Gibbs/Kolb/Driscoll]"
- Use stage/question labels as subheadings (e.g., "Description:", "SO WHAT?")
- End with clear action statement

### Success Criteria (from Reflective Essay Rubric)

- **Framework Application (25%):** All stages/questions addressed with clear connections between sections (not just listed separately)
- **Critical Analysis & Insight (35%):** Demonstrates self-awareness, connects to course theory, shows assumption challenging
- **Action Planning (20%):** Specific, concrete actions with timelines; strong connection to Personal Development Plan goals
- **Writing Quality (15%):** Clear organization, professional academic tone, no unnecessary words
- **Citation (5%):** Course concept referenced in APA format if applicable

### Resources Provided

**Templates on Moodle:**
- Gibbs Reflective Cycle Template (Word doc)
- Kolb Experiential Learning Template (Word doc)
- Driscoll "What? So What? Now What?" Template (Word doc)

**Prompting Questions Checklist:**
Use Alt et al.'s (2022) prompting questions if you get stuck:
- **Cognitive:** What assumptions did I hold? What challenged them?
- **Behavioral:** What specific actions will I take?
- **Affective:** What emotions did I feel? Why?
- **Professional:** How does this inform my career goals?

**Example Reflection (Driscoll format, 198 words):**

> **Framework: Driscoll's "What? So What? Now What?"**
>
> **WHAT?** My VIA Character Strengths assessment revealed "Love of Learning" as my #1 strength, but I often procrastinate on schoolwork and only engage deeply with topics I find personally interesting.
>
> **SO WHAT?** This apparent contradiction reflects Deci & Ryan's Self-Determination Theory (Week 2 reading): I thrive on intrinsic motivation but resist extrinsic requirements. My "love of learning" activates only when I have autonomy over what I learn. This challenges my assumption that procrastination means I'm lazy—instead, it signals a mismatch between task structure and my motivational drivers. Connecting to Dweck's growth mindset (Week 9 preview), I've been operating with a fixed view: "Either I'm interested or I'm not." But I can CULTIVATE interest through reframing.
>
> **NOW WHAT?** For each assignment this semester, I'll spend 5 minutes before starting to write: "What will I know after completing this that I don't know now?" This reframes tasks from extrinsic requirements to intrinsic learning opportunities. Success metric: I'll track procrastination duration—goal is 50% reduction by mid-semester. I'll also discuss this insight in my next mentor meeting (Meeting 2, Week 5) to explore career implications: Do I need high-autonomy work environments?

**Why this works:**
- ✅ All three Driscoll questions addressed thoroughly
- ✅ Level 3 depth: Shows transformation ("I can cultivate interest")
- ✅ Course concepts: Deci & Ryan's SDT, Dweck's growth mindset
- ✅ Specific action: 5-minute reframing ritual, 50% procrastination reduction
- ✅ Connects to assessments: Mentor Meeting 2, PDP career implications

### Workshop Process

**Part 1: Individual Reflection Writing (60 minutes)**

1. **Choose your experience and framework (5 min):**
   - Review the four experience options
   - Select the framework that feels most natural
   - Download template from Moodle if helpful

2. **Brainstorm raw material (10 min):**
   - Write everything you remember about the experience (don't filter yet)
   - Note your feelings, assumptions, surprises
   - Jot down any course concepts that might connect

3. **Apply framework stages (30 min):**
   - Work through each stage/question systematically
   - Use prompting questions checklist if stuck
   - Aim for Level 3 depth (ask yourself: "So what? Why does this matter? What will I DO differently?")
   - Count words as you go—stay around 200

4. **Refine and polish (15 min):**
   - Ensure all framework stages are addressed
   - Check: Is there a course concept reference?
   - Verify: Is the action plan specific and measurable?
   - Proofread for clarity and concision

**Tutor support available throughout:** Raise your hand if you're stuck on a particular stage or can't identify a course concept to connect.

**Part 2: Peer Feedback Exchange (20 minutes)**

5. **Partner up (2 min):**
   - Find a partner (preferably someone who used a different framework)
   - Exchange reflections—read each other's work silently

6. **Feedback questions (8 min per person, 16 min total):**
   - **Framework check:** "Are all stages/questions addressed? Any gaps?"
   - **Depth check:** "Is this Level 1, 2, or 3? Where could it go deeper?"
   - **Action check:** "Is the action plan specific enough? Can you measure it?"
   - **Surprise check:** "What surprised you about this reflection?"

7. **Revise based on feedback (4 min):**
   - Incorporate one piece of partner feedback
   - Strengthen weakest section

**Part 3: Class Share (10 min)**

8. **Volunteer sharing (2 minutes each, 4-6 students):**
   - Read your "Action Plan" section aloud (not the full reflection)
   - State which framework you used and why you chose it
   - Answer: "What was hardest about this exercise?"

9. **Class discussion (remaining time):**
   - Which framework felt most natural? Why?
   - What strategies helped move from Level 1 to Level 3?
   - How will you apply this to field trip reflection?

### What to Do If You're Stuck

**"I can't think of an experience to write about."**
→ Use your first mentor meeting—everyone has had one. Reflect on a specific piece of advice your mentor gave.

**"I'm stuck at description—can't get to analysis."**
→ Ask yourself: "What assumption did I hold before this experience? What challenged that assumption?" This forces deeper thinking.

**"I don't know which course concept to reference."**
→ Review lecture slides from Weeks 1-2. Look for: AI impact on careers, context engineering, human judgment, growth mindset preview, Covey's principles, future skills frameworks.

**"My action plan feels vague."**
→ Apply this test: Could someone observe and verify your action? "Improve communication" = vague. "Ask 3 clarifying questions in every mentor meeting" = specific.

**"I'm over 200 words."**
→ Cut redundancy. Remove throat-clearing phrases ("I think that," "It is important to note"). Use active voice. Every sentence should advance your reflection.

### Participation Expectation

⚠️ **You must produce a 200-word reflection to share with a partner.** Incomplete work affects participation marks. This is practice for your 10% Reflective Essay—treat it seriously.

**Save your work:** This reflection serves three purposes:
1. Tutorial participation credit (today)
2. Portfolio reference for Reflective Essay (you'll see how much easier 1,500 words is after practicing 200)
3. Evidence for PDP Section 6 ("How course learning changed your thinking")
