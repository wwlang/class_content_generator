# Week 3 Tutorial: Reflection & Reflective Learning

## Tutorial Overview

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Topic:** Practicing Reflective Frameworks
**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply Gibbs', Kolb's, and Driscoll's frameworks to analyze personal experiences
- Compare reflection quality across different frameworks
- Practice structured reflection for mentorship program

---

## Part 1: Quick Review (5 minutes)

### Tutor-Led Recap

**Three Frameworks Covered Today:**

1. **Gibbs' Reflective Cycle** (6 stages)
   - Description → Feelings → Evaluation → Analysis → Conclusion → Action Plan

2. **Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle** (4 stages)
   - Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation

3. **Driscoll & Bolton Model** (3 questions)
   - What? → So What? → Now What?

**Key Principle:** Experience + Structured Reflection = Learning

**Tutorial Goal:** Practice all three frameworks so you can choose confidently for your reflective essay and mentorship reflections.

## Part 2: Main Activity – Three-Framework Practice (75 minutes)

### Stage 1: Shared Experience Baseline (10 minutes)

**Activity: Reflect on Weeks 1-2 Content**

**Tutor Instructions:**
"We're going to practice reflection using content from our first two weeks. Think back to Week 1 (Introduction & Future of Work) or Week 2 (Career Skills in the AI Era). Choose ONE specific moment that stuck with you—maybe a statistic that surprised you, a discussion that challenged your thinking, or a concept you're still processing."

**Individual Reflection (5 minutes):**
- Write down the specific moment/experience you're selecting
- Note your initial thoughts: Why did this moment stand out?

**Pair Share (5 minutes):**
- Partner with the person next to you
- Each person shares their selected moment (2 minutes each)
- No analysis yet—just describe what happened

**Purpose:** Establish a concrete experience everyone can work with for framework practice

---

### Stage 2: Framework Rotation (60 minutes)

**Overview:**
Students will apply all three reflective frameworks to their chosen Week 1-2 experience, rotating through stations.

#### Station 1: Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (20 minutes)

**Setup:**
Provide handout with Gibbs' six stages and guiding questions for each stage.

**Individual Work (15 minutes):**

Work through all six stages for your chosen Week 1-2 experience:

**1. Description**
- What was the specific moment/concept?
- What were you doing? (listening, discussing, thinking)
- What was said or presented?

**2. Feelings**
- What were your immediate reactions?
- How did you feel? (surprised, confused, excited, skeptical?)
- What were you thinking during the moment?

**3. Evaluation**
- What was positive about this moment?
- What was challenging or uncomfortable?
- What went well in how you engaged with it?

**4. Analysis**
- Why did this moment stand out to you?
- What does your reaction tell you about your values or assumptions?
- How does this connect to other course concepts or your prior experiences?
- Which theories or frameworks from Weeks 1-2 help explain your reaction?

**5. Conclusion**
- What did you learn from this moment?
- What would you do differently if you encountered similar content again?
- What skills or knowledge do you need to develop?

**6. Action Plan**
- What specific actions will you take based on this insight?
- When will you take these actions?
- How will you know if you've successfully applied this learning?

**Small Group Discussion (5 minutes):**
- Groups of 3-4 students
- Each person shares: Which stage was hardest? Which generated the most insight?
- Discuss: Did the Feelings stage reveal anything unexpected?

#### Station 2: Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (20 minutes)

**Setup:**
Provide handout with Kolb's four stages and guiding questions.

**Individual Work (15 minutes):**

Apply Kolb's cycle to the SAME Week 1-2 experience:

**1. Concrete Experience**
- Describe the experience objectively
- What were you doing?
- What happened?

**2. Reflective Observation**
- What did you notice during this experience?
- What patterns or themes emerged?
- What perspectives did others have? (if discussed)
- What was significant?

**3. Abstract Conceptualization**
- What does this experience mean?
- What general principles can you derive from this specific moment?
- How does this connect to theories from Weeks 1-2? (e.g., AI impact on careers, skills evolution, context engineering, human judgment)
- What new understanding do you have?

**4. Active Experimentation**
- What will you try differently based on this learning?
- How can you test this new understanding?
- What's one small experiment you can run this week?
- What new experience will this create?

**Pair Discussion (5 minutes):**
- Compare Gibbs vs. Kolb: Which felt more natural to you?
- Did Kolb's emphasis on experimentation (not just action planning) change how you thought about next steps?
- Which framework generated deeper analysis for you?

---

#### Station 3: Driscoll & Bolton Model (20 minutes)

**Setup:**
Provide handout with Driscoll's three questions.

**Individual Work (10 minutes):**

Apply Driscoll's model to the SAME Week 1-2 experience:

**1. WHAT?**
- What happened during this moment?
- What did you see/hear/think/feel?
- What were you trying to achieve or understand?

**2. SO WHAT?**
- So what does this mean for your learning?
- So what were the consequences of this moment?
- So what more do you need to know?
- So what assumptions did this challenge?

**3. NOW WHAT?**
- Now what will you do differently?
- Now what might happen if you apply this learning?
- Now what support or resources do you need?
- Now what's your next step?

**Small Group Discussion (10 minutes):**

Groups of 3-4 students discuss:

1. **Comparison Across Frameworks:**
   - Which framework gave you the deepest insights?
   - Which was fastest to apply?
   - Which will you use for your mentorship reflections? Why?

2. **Reflection Quality:**
   - Did using three different frameworks reveal different insights from the SAME experience?
   - Which framework pushed you past description into real analysis?
   - Did the structure help or feel restrictive?

3. **Application Planning:**
   - For your Individual Assignment reflective essay (field trip + guest speaker), which framework will you choose?
   - For weekly mentorship reflections, will you stick with one framework or rotate?
   - What surprised you about the reflection process today?

## Part 3: Before Next Class (10 minutes)

### Assignment & Preparation

**1. Apply Learning to Mentorship (Week 3 Homework)**

Before your next mentorship meeting:
- Choose one framework (Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll)
- Use it to reflect on your most recent mentorship meeting
- Submit your reflection as part of your Week 3 post-meeting reflection form

**Tip:** Try the framework you found MOST challenging today—practice strengthens the skill.

**2. Framework Selection for Reflective Essay**

Start thinking now (even though the essay isn't due until after Week 10):
- Which framework matches your thinking style?
- Gibbs' detail? Kolb's cycle? Driscoll's simplicity?
- There's no wrong choice—pick the one that helps you analyze deeply

**3. Reading for Week 4: Self-Managed Learning**

Next week we explore metacognition and strategic learning. Preview the readings:
- Zimmerman, B. J. (2002). Becoming a self-regulated learner: An overview.
- Stanton, J. D., et al. (2021). Fostering metacognition to support student learning.

**Connection to Today:** Self-managed learning requires reflecting on HOW you learn (metacognition), which builds directly on today's reflection frameworks.

## Tutor Closing Notes

### Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **Reflection is a skill** that improves with practice—today was practice, not mastery
2. **All three frameworks work**—choose based on context and personal preference
3. **Structure enables depth**—frameworks prevent shallow "I learned a lot" statements
4. **Start using immediately**—apply to mentorship reflections this week

### Common Student Questions

**Q: "Do I have to use the same framework every time?"**
A: No! You can switch frameworks based on context. Quick reflections = Driscoll. Comprehensive essays = Gibbs or Kolb. Experiment to find what works.

**Q: "What if my reflection doesn't fit neatly into the stages?"**
A: That's normal. Reflection is messy. The frameworks provide structure, not straightjackets. If a stage doesn't apply, explain why and move to the next.

**Q: "Which framework will score highest on the reflective essay?"**
A: All three score equally IF applied well. Grading focuses on depth of reflection, not framework choice. Use the one that helps YOU reflect deeply.

**Q: "How long should each stage be in the essay?"**
A: Varies by framework, but generally: Description (20%), Analysis (40-50%), Action Planning (20-30%), Other stages (balance). Analysis should be longest—that's where critical thinking shows.

## Tutorial Success Indicators

**Students are successful if they:**
- Complete reflections using all three frameworks
- Identify which framework(s) work best for their thinking style
- Recognize that structured frameworks generate deeper insights than unstructured "journaling"

- Can explain when to use each framework (depth vs. speed tradeoffs)

**Tutor is successful if:**
- All students complete at least one full reflection cycle using each framework
- Students engage in meaningful comparison discussions (not just "I liked X best")
- Students connect reflection frameworks to upcoming assessments (mentorship, essay, PDP)
- Students leave with concrete plans for which framework to use in next mentorship reflection
