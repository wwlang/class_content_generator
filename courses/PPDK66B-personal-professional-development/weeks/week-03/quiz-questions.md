    question: |
      Which stage of Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle involves testing new approaches based on what you learned?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Concrete Experience"
        feedback: "Concrete Experience is the first stage—having or doing an experience, not testing new approaches."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "Reflective Observation"
        feedback: "Reflective Observation involves reviewing and reflecting on the experience, not testing new behaviors."

    topic: "Driscoll & Bolton Model"

    question: |
      Driscoll & Bolton's reflective model is organized around which three questions?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Who? Where? When?"
        feedback: "These are journalistic questions for gathering facts, not Driscoll's reflective framework."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "What? So What? Now What?"
        feedback: "Correct! Driscoll & Bolton's model uses three elegant questions: What? (description), So What? (analysis), and Now What? (action planning)."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Why? How? Who?"
        feedback: "These are not the three questions in Driscoll & Bolton's model."
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "Before? During? After?"
        feedback: "These represent time periods, not Driscoll's three reflective questions."

    topic: "Single-loop vs. Double-loop Learning"

    question: |
      According to Argyris & Schön, what is the key difference between single-loop and double-loop learning?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Single-loop learning is faster than double-loop learning"
        feedback: "The distinction isn't about speed but about depth—whether you question underlying assumptions."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "Single-loop learning corrects errors within existing assumptions; double-loop learning questions the assumptions themselves"
        feedback: "Correct! Single-loop learning makes surface-level adjustments (like a thermostat maintaining temperature). Double-loop learning questions the underlying approach (is a thermostat the right system?)."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Single-loop learning is for individuals; double-loop learning is for organizations"
        feedback: "Both types of learning apply to individuals AND organizations. The difference is depth of reflection, not who is learning."
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "Single-loop learning requires reflection; double-loop learning does not"
        feedback: "Actually, it's the opposite—double-loop learning requires deeper reflection to question assumptions, while single-loop can happen without much reflection."

    topic: "Gibbs' Reflective Cycle Application"

    question: |
      You're reflecting on your first mentorship meeting using Gibbs' Reflective Cycle. During the 'Feelings' stage, you realize you felt anxious and intimidated. What should you do with this insight in the subsequent stages?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Ignore it; feelings aren't relevant to professional reflection"
        feedback: "Gibbs explicitly includes feelings because emotions reveal values and create learning opportunities. Ignoring them misses important insights."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "Only mention it in the Feelings stage and don't refer to it again"
        feedback: "Feelings should inform your analysis. Asking 'Why did I feel anxious?' can reveal assumptions worth examining."
        correct: false

      - key: "C"
        text: "Analyze why you felt that way and consider how it affected your behavior, then plan how to manage similar feelings in future meetings"
        feedback: "Correct! Feelings are data. In Analysis, explore WHY you felt anxious (lack of preparation? impostor syndrome?). In Action Plan, address it (e.g., 'I'll prepare 5 questions in advance to feel more confident')."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "Ask your mentor to change their communication style to reduce your anxiety"
        feedback: "While you could discuss communication preferences, the deeper learning comes from understanding YOUR emotional response and developing strategies to manage it."
        correct: false

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle Application"

    question: |
      During the MISA field trip (Week 6), you notice that employees spend significant time in collaborative meetings. Using Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, what would be the most appropriate next step after this 'Concrete Experience' and your 'Reflective Observation'?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Immediately plan to spend more time in meetings yourself"
        feedback: "This skips the critical Abstract Conceptualization stage. Before changing behavior, you need to analyze what this observation means."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "Develop a general principle about collaboration's role in organizational culture and connect it to course concepts like emotional intelligence"
        feedback: "Correct! Abstract Conceptualization involves moving from specific observation (MISA's meetings) to general principle (collaboration as cultural value) and connecting to theories (EI, organizational culture). THEN you plan experiments."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Describe the meeting rooms and office layout in detail"
        feedback: "Description is part of Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation. You've already done that. Next comes conceptualization—what does it MEAN?"
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "Ask MISA employees how they feel about meetings"
        feedback: "While gathering more data could be valuable, Kolb's next stage after Reflective Observation is Abstract Conceptualization—making sense of what you already observed."
        correct: false

    topic: "Framework Selection"

    question: |
      You have 10 minutes immediately after a guest speaker session to capture your reflections before you forget important details. Which reflective framework would be most appropriate for this situation?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, because it provides the most comprehensive structure"
        feedback: "While Gibbs is comprehensive, its six stages require more time than you have. In 10 minutes, you'd need to rush through stages, sacrificing depth."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, because it emphasizes continuous learning"
        feedback: "Kolb's four stages are better than Gibbs for time constraints, but there's an even faster option for capturing immediate insights."
        correct: false

      - key: "C"
        text: "Driscoll & Bolton's model, because its three questions enable quick but structured reflection"
        feedback: "Correct! Driscoll's 'What? So What? Now What?' can be completed quickly while capturing essential elements: description, analysis, and action. You can elaborate later using Gibbs or Kolb."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "None—structured reflection requires at least 30 minutes"
        feedback: "While deeper reflection takes time, Driscoll's framework is specifically designed for quick reflections. Capturing something structured is better than relying on memory later."
        correct: false

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Single-loop vs. Double-loop Learning"

    question: |
      After receiving feedback that your mentorship reflections are too surface-level, you decide to 'write longer reflections.' Based on Argyris & Schön's concepts, what type of learning does this represent?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Double-loop learning, because you're making a change based on feedback"
        feedback: "Making a change isn't enough for double-loop learning. You're adjusting surface behavior (length) without questioning WHY your reflections lack depth."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "Single-loop learning, because you're correcting the symptom (length) without examining why your reflections lack depth"
        feedback: "Correct! Single-loop learning adjusts behaviors within existing assumptions. You're assuming 'surface-level = too short' when the real issue might be: Am I analyzing? Connecting to theory? Questioning assumptions? Double-loop would question WHAT makes reflection deep."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Neither type of learning, because you're just following instructions"
        feedback: "You are learning—just at a surface level. Single-loop learning involves making adjustments based on feedback, even if those adjustments don't address root causes."
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "Double-loop learning, because you're reflecting on your reflection practice"
        feedback: "Reflecting on reflection could be double-loop, but only if you question underlying assumptions. Here, you're changing surface behavior (length) without examining what 'depth' actually requires."
        correct: false

    topic: "The Reflective Practitioner"

    question: |
      The lecture stated that 70% of professional development comes from on-the-job experiences, but only if you reflect on them. Which concept from Week 3 best explains why two professionals can have the same experience but learn completely different lessons?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "The reflective practitioner concept: one professional uses structured reflection while the other does not"
        feedback: "Correct! Schön's reflective practitioner research shows that professionals who deliberately examine their experiences through reflection-on-action and reflection-in-action extract more learning. Experience alone doesn't guarantee growth."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Single-loop vs. double-loop learning: one uses single-loop, the other uses double-loop"
        feedback: "While this explains depth of learning, it doesn't fully capture why the same experience yields different lessons. The broader concept is the reflective practitioner—whether someone reflects at all."
        correct: false

      - key: "C"
        text: "Learning styles: different people prefer different stages of Kolb's cycle"
        feedback: "Learning styles explain preferences for how we learn, but the key issue is whether someone actively reflects at all, not which stage they prefer."
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "Framework selection: one uses Gibbs, the other uses Driscoll"
        feedback: "Both frameworks enable learning. The critical difference isn't WHICH framework but WHETHER someone uses structured reflection versus passive experience accumulation."
        correct: false

    topic: "Gibbs' Reflective Cycle Stages"

    question: |
      In Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, what is the primary difference between the 'Evaluation' stage and the 'Analysis' stage?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Evaluation identifies what went well/badly; Analysis explains WHY things went well/badly"
        feedback: "Correct! Evaluation is descriptive judgment ('This went well, that went badly'). Analysis is explanatory ('This went well BECAUSE X; that went badly BECAUSE Y'). Evaluation = value judgment; Analysis = causal explanation."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Evaluation focuses on emotions; Analysis focuses on facts"
        feedback: "Emotions are addressed in the Feelings stage (Stage 2), not Evaluation. Evaluation judges outcomes; Analysis explains causes."
        correct: false

      - key: "C"
        text: "Evaluation comes after reflection; Analysis comes before"
        feedback: "Both Evaluation and Analysis are part of reflection. Evaluation (Stage 3) actually comes BEFORE Analysis (Stage 4) in Gibbs' sequence."
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "There is no meaningful difference; they are interchangeable terms"
        feedback: "They serve distinct purposes: Evaluation makes initial judgments (good/bad); Analysis digs deeper into causes and connections to theory."
        correct: false

    topic: "Comparing Frameworks"

    question: |
      A student says: 'I prefer Kolb's model because Active Experimentation feels more action-oriented than Gibbs' Action Plan.' What does this student understand about the difference between these two frameworks?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "The student is mistaken; both stages emphasize the same type of planning"
        feedback: "The student correctly identifies a real difference. Kolb's Active Experimentation emphasizes testing and doing, not just planning intentions."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "The student recognizes that Kolb emphasizes experimenting with new behaviors, not just planning to change"
        feedback: "Correct! The student understands a key distinction: Gibbs' Action Plan = 'What will I do differently?' (intention). Kolb's Active Experimentation = 'Testing new approaches' (actual behavior change). Kolb emphasizes the doing that creates new Concrete Experiences."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "The student prefers Kolb's model because it has fewer stages"
        feedback: "The student's reasoning is about the nature of the action stage (experimentation vs. planning), not the number of stages (though Kolb does have fewer)."
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "The student misunderstands; Active Experimentation is about abstract thinking, not action"
        feedback: "Active Experimentation is indeed about action—it's Stage 4 in Kolb's cycle where you test new approaches based on your conceptualization."
        correct: false

    topic: "Framework Selection for Assessments"

    question: |
      For your Individual Assignment reflective essay (1,500 words analyzing the field trip and guest speaker), you choose Driscoll's model (What? So What? Now What?). What challenge might you face with this choice?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Driscoll's model isn't evidence-based, so you'll lose points"
        feedback: "Driscoll & Bolton (2000) is evidence-based and accepted for the essay. All three frameworks (Gibbs, Kolb, Driscoll) are valid choices."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "The three-question structure might feel too simple for developing 1,500 words of deep analysis"
        feedback: "Correct! While Driscoll is perfectly valid, its simplicity is designed for quick reflections. For a comprehensive 1,500-word essay, you might find Gibbs' six stages or Kolb's four stages provide more scaffolding for organizing and deepening your analysis. You CAN use Driscoll if you develop depth within each question."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Driscoll can only be used for positive experiences, not critical reflection"
        feedback: "Driscoll works for any type of reflection—positive, negative, or mixed. The 'So What?' question prompts critical analysis regardless of experience type."
        correct: false

      - key: "D"
        text: "You cannot use Driscoll for academic essays; it's only for professional journals"
        feedback: "Driscoll is acceptable for academic essays. The assignment allows you to choose any of the three frameworks covered (Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll)."
        correct: false
