# Reflection & Reflective Learning

## Learning to Learn from Experience

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 3, where we explore one of the most valuable professional skills: the ability to learn from experience through structured reflection. Today introduces frameworks that transform everyday experiences into powerful learning opportunities. This skill directly supports your mentorship program (ongoing), your reflective essay (due after Week 10), and your Personal Development Plan (due Week 11).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="Hook: The Experience Gap">

# 70%

**of professional development comes from on-the-job experiences**

**...but only if you reflect on them**

*(Center for Creative Leadership, 70-20-10 Model)*

<speaker-notes>
This statistic reveals a paradox: experience alone doesn't guarantee learning. Two people can have the same experience and learn completely different lessons—or one learns nothing at all. The difference? Structured reflection. Today's frameworks ensure you extract maximum value from your field trip (Week 6), guest speaker (Week 10), mentorship meetings, and every professional experience throughout your career.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Gibbs' Reflective Cycle to analyze personal experiences systematically
2. **Apply** Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle to accelerate learning from concrete experiences
3. **Compare** three reflective frameworks (Gibbs, Kolb, Driscoll) and select appropriate models for different contexts
4. **Evaluate** the quality of reflective writing using evidence-based criteria

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are directly testable in your Week 3 quiz. More importantly, you'll use these frameworks immediately in your mentorship reflections and later in your Individual Assignment reflective essay. "Apply" means you should be able to take any experience—a difficult conversation, a class activity, a mentor meeting—and analyze it using these frameworks to extract actionable insights.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You

| Assessment | Due | Today's Relevance |
|------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Mentorship Program** | Ongoing (Weeks 2-11) | Post-meeting reflections require structured reflection on mentor advice |
| **Reflective Essay** | After Week 10 | Must use Gibbs, Kolb, OR Driscoll to analyze field trip and guest speaker |
| **Personal Development Plan** | Week 11 | Reflection quality determines depth of self-awareness and goal-setting |

**Your choice of reflective framework (Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll) structures your entire essay**

<speaker-notes>
The reflective essay specifically requires you to choose ONE of today's frameworks and use it as your essay structure. Gibbs gives you six sections; Kolb gives you four stages; Driscoll gives you three questions. Your mentorship post-meeting reflections should practice these frameworks weekly—students who use frameworks consistently score 15-20% higher on the essay than those who don't. The tutorial today provides immediate practice.

# Today's Journey

**1. Why Reflection Matters**
*The reflective practitioner concept*

**2. Gibbs' Reflective Cycle**
*Six stages for deep reflection*

**3. Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle**
*Four-stage learning spiral*

**4. Alternative Models & Application**
*Driscoll's "What? So What? Now What?"*

<speaker-notes>
Four segments with natural break points. Segment 1 establishes the "why" (motivation and theory). Segments 2-3 teach the "how" (two major frameworks). Segment 4 provides alternatives and practical application guidance. Each framework builds on the previous—Gibbs offers detail, Kolb emphasizes the learning cycle, Driscoll simplifies for quick reflection.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Part 1: The Reflective Practitioner">

# Part 1: Why Reflection Matters

## The Reflective Practitioner Concept

<speaker-notes>
Before learning specific frameworks, we need to understand WHY structured reflection is essential for professional development. The concept of the "reflective practitioner" originated in Donald Schön's research on how professionals actually learn and improve—not from textbooks, but from thoughtfully examining their own practice.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="quote" title="Schön's Insight">

> "The capacity to reflect on action so as to engage in a process of continuous learning is one of the defining characteristics of professional practice."

**— Donald Schön, 1983**
*The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action*

<speaker-notes>
Schön studied doctors, architects, and managers to understand how professionals improve. He found that experts don't just accumulate experience—they deliberately examine their experiences, identify patterns, test new approaches, and refine their thinking. This "reflection-on-action" (thinking back) and "reflection-in-action" (thinking during) distinguish growing professionals from stagnant ones. Your mentorship program is designed to develop this capacity.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Experience vs. Learning">

## Experience ≠ Automatic Learning

### Two Professionals, Same Experience, Different Outcomes

**Professional A (Non-Reflective):**
- Presentation goes poorly
- "That was terrible. I'm bad at presenting."
- Avoids presentations when possible
- No improvement over time

**Professional B (Reflective):**
- Presentation goes poorly
- Uses Gibbs' Cycle: *What happened? Why? What can I change?*
- Identifies specific issue: "I didn't practice out loud; I assumed reading slides would work"
- Next presentation: practices 5 times, improves significantly

<speaker-notes>
This example shows why 10 years of experience isn't the same as 10 years of learning. Professional A has defensive reactions (Argyris' "single-loop learning"—changing surface behaviors). Professional B uses structured reflection to identify root causes and implement meaningful change (Argyris' "double-loop learning"—questioning underlying assumptions). Your goal: become Professional B.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Single-Loop vs. Double-Loop Learning">

## Argyris & Schön: Two Types of Learning

### Single-Loop Learning
**Detect and correct errors within existing assumptions**

Example: "My presentation failed → I'll speak louder next time"
- Surface-level adjustment
- Doesn't question underlying approach
- Limited improvement

### Double-Loop Learning
**Question the assumptions behind actions**

Example: "My presentation failed → Why did I think reading slides would engage the audience? What IS effective presenting?"
- Challenges mental models
- Leads to fundamental change
- Accelerates growth

<speaker-notes>
Single-loop is like adjusting a thermostat—you change the temperature but not the system. Double-loop questions whether a thermostat is even the right approach. In your mentorship reflections, challenge yourself: "Why did I think X would work?" not just "X didn't work." Kolb and Gibbs both encourage double-loop learning by prompting you to analyze assumptions and conceptualize new approaches.

<slide number="10" layout="section-break" title="Part 2: Gibbs' Reflective Cycle">

# Part 2: Gibbs' Reflective Cycle

## A Six-Stage Framework for Deep Reflection

<speaker-notes>
Graham Gibbs developed this framework in 1988 specifically for educational debriefing—helping students learn from practical experiences. It's become the most widely used reflective framework in UK higher education and health professions. The six stages provide comprehensive structure, making it ideal for detailed reflection like your Individual Assignment essay.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="Gibbs' Six Stages">

## Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (1988)

```
    1. DESCRIPTION
         ↓
    2. FEELINGS  ←──┐
         ↓          │
    3. EVALUATION   │
         ↓          │
    4. ANALYSIS     │ Cyclical:
         ↓          │ Leads to
    5. CONCLUSION   │ next
         ↓          │ experience
    6. ACTION PLAN ─┘
```

**Key Feature:** Explicitly includes emotional processing (Feelings stage)

<speaker-notes>
Walk through the cycle clockwise. Description = what happened (objective facts). Feelings = your emotional response (often overlooked but crucial). Evaluation = what went well/badly (initial judgment). Analysis = why it happened (deeper thinking). Conclusion = what you learned (synthesis). Action Plan = what you'll do differently (future behavior). The cycle is continuous—your action plan leads to new experiences to reflect on.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Gibbs Stage 1: Description">

## Stage 1: Description

### What happened?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What was the situation or experience?
- Who was involved?
- What did you do?
- What was the outcome?

**Purpose:** Establish objective facts before interpreting

**Example (Mentorship Context):**
*"In my second mentorship meeting, I asked my mentor about switching careers mid-life. She shared a 15-minute story about leaving corporate banking to start a social enterprise. I took notes on her decision-making process and the challenges she faced."*

<speaker-notes>
Description should be factual and concrete—like a journalist reporting. Avoid interpretation here ("She seemed stressed" = interpretation; "She paused for 10 seconds and sighed" = description). Students often skip straight to feelings or analysis; insist on objective description first. In your reflective essay, the Description section (200-300 words) summarizes the field trip and guest speaker objectively before analyzing.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="Gibbs Stage 2: Feelings">

## Stage 2: Feelings

### What were you thinking and feeling?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What were your initial reactions?
- How did you feel at different stages?
- What were you thinking about during the experience?
- How do you feel about it now?

**Purpose:** Acknowledge emotional dimension of learning

**Example:**
*"I felt inspired hearing about her courage to change careers, but also anxious—'Can I really do that?' I was simultaneously excited (new possibilities) and scared (financial risk). Now, reflecting on it, I feel motivated to explore options rather than accepting the first job I'm offered."*

<speaker-notes>
Feelings are data, not distractions. They reveal what matters to you (values) and where learning opportunities exist. Many students (especially in business programs) want to skip this stage—it feels "soft" or unprofessional. Resist that. Goleman's EI research shows self-awareness of emotions predicts career success. Gibbs' inclusion of this stage acknowledges that reflection without emotional processing misses crucial insights. The word "thinking" gives permission to discuss cognitive responses too.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="Gibbs Stage 3: Evaluation">

## Stage 3: Evaluation

### What was good and bad about the experience?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What was positive about the experience?
- What was negative or challenging?

**Purpose:** Make initial value judgments before deeper analysis

**Example:**
*"Good: My mentor gave specific examples, not generic advice. I learned that career changes are possible with planning. Bad: I realized I haven't researched career options thoroughly—I asked surface-level questions. I could have prepared better by researching her career path beforehand."*

<speaker-notes>
Evaluation is your gut response—what worked, what didn't. This differs from Analysis (next stage), which asks "why?" Evaluation is descriptive judgment; Analysis is explanatory. Students often confuse these. Evaluation says "My question was weak." Analysis explains "My question was weak because I hadn't prepared thoroughly, which stems from my tendency to wing it rather than plan."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="content" title="Gibbs Stage 4: Analysis">

## Stage 4: Analysis

### What sense can you make of the situation?

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why did things go well?
- Why didn't things go well?
- What was really going on?
- What theories or models help explain what happened?

**Purpose:** Deep thinking—connecting experience to broader patterns and concepts

**Example:**
*"The meeting worked well because I asked open-ended questions ('How did you decide?' vs. 'Was it hard?'). This connects to Week 7 concepts—emotional intelligence requires curiosity. The meeting could have been better if I'd used Kolb's cycle: I had a concrete experience (Week 1 class) but didn't reflect before meeting my mentor, so I missed opportunities to discuss specific confusions. My lack of preparation reflects a fixed mindset (Week 9)—I assumed reflection happens naturally rather than requiring deliberate effort."*

<speaker-notes>
Analysis is where double-loop learning happens. You question assumptions and connect experiences to course concepts. Encourage students to explicitly reference frameworks: "This relates to X theory" or "Looking at Kolb's model, I see..." This demonstrates synthesis and elevates reflection from storytelling to academic analysis. In your reflective essay, this is the longest section (35% of grade) because depth of analysis determines reflection quality.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="content" title="Gibbs Stage 5: Conclusion">

## Stage 5: Conclusion

### What else could you have done?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What did you learn from this experience?
- What could you have done differently?
- What skills or knowledge do you need to develop?
- What patterns are you noticing in your behavior?

**Purpose:** Synthesize learning and identify development needs

**Example:**
*"I learned that career changes require financial planning and skill-building over 1-2 years—not impulsive decisions. I could have prepared questions in advance and shared my self-assessment results for personalized advice. I need to develop: (1) research skills—investigating career paths before discussions, (2) strategic thinking—connecting short-term actions to long-term goals, (3) follow-through—implementing advice rather than just collecting it."*

<speaker-notes>
Conclusion answers "So what?" It captures the lesson learned. This is NOT the action plan yet—that's next. Conclusion = insight; Action Plan = behavior change. Many students write vague conclusions: "I learned a lot" or "Communication is important." Push for specificity: "I learned WHAT specifically?" Conclusion should articulate a transferable principle you can apply beyond this single experience.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Gibbs Stage 6: Action Plan">

## Stage 6: Action Plan

### If the situation arose again, what would you do?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What will you do differently next time?
- What steps will you take to develop needed skills?
- How will you apply this learning?
- What specific actions will you take, by when?

**Purpose:** Convert insights into concrete behavior change

**Example:**
*"Before my next mentorship meeting (October 10): (1) Review mentor's LinkedIn and prepare 5 specific questions based on her career path, (2) Complete VIA Character Strengths assessment and bring results to discuss alignment with careers, (3) Research 3 career paths in my Holland Code categories and ask mentor's perspective. Within 1 week after meeting: implement one piece of advice she gives and report back on results."*

<speaker-notes>
Action Plans must be SMART (Week 11 concept preview): Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. "I'll prepare better" is not an action plan. "I'll spend 30 minutes before each meeting writing 5 questions based on our last discussion" is SMART. The action plan closes the loop—it leads to new experiences, which you'll reflect on again. This continuous cycle drives professional growth. In your PDP (Assessment 3), every goal requires an action plan.

# Part 3: Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

## Learning as a Continuous Spiral

<speaker-notes>
David Kolb's model (originally 1966, updated with Alice Kolb in 2017) focuses on experiential learning—the process of learning through doing. While Gibbs emphasizes reflection structure, Kolb emphasizes the complete learning cycle from experience to experimentation. This model underpins your entire mentorship program design.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="framework" title="Kolb's Four Stages">

## Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (1966/2017)

```
  CONCRETE EXPERIENCE
  (Doing/Having an experience)
           ↓
  REFLECTIVE OBSERVATION ←──┐
  (Reviewing/Reflecting)     │
           ↓                 │ Learning
  ABSTRACT CONCEPTUALIZATION │ Spiral
  (Concluding/Learning)      │
           ↓                 │
  ACTIVE EXPERIMENTATION ────┘
  (Planning/Trying new approaches)
```

**Key Feature:** Emphasizes testing ideas through experimentation (not just planning)

<speaker-notes>
Kolb's cycle shows learning as a spiral, not a checklist. You experience something (Concrete Experience), think about what happened (Reflective Observation), form theories about why (Abstract Conceptualization), test those theories (Active Experimentation), which creates new experiences. The spiral continues. Key difference from Gibbs: Kolb emphasizes the testing phase—you must try new approaches to learn, not just plan them. This connects to Week 9's growth mindset: learning requires attempting new behaviors, risking failure, and iterating.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Kolb Stage 1: Concrete Experience">

## Stage 1: Concrete Experience

### Doing/Having an experience

**What it means:**
- An event or activity you participate in directly
- "Being there" and engaging with a situation
- The raw material for learning

**Examples in this course:**
- Field trip to MISA Company (Week 6)
- Guest speaker session with Ms. Ha Linh (Week 10)
- Mentorship meetings (Weeks 2-11)
- Tutorial activities (every week)
- Using self-assessment tools (Week 5)

<speaker-notes>
Concrete Experience is the starting point—you can't reflect on something you haven't experienced. This is why your course includes field trips, guest speakers, mentorship, and activities rather than just lectures. Kolb argues that passive information consumption (reading, listening to lectures) is insufficient for deep learning—you need direct, personal involvement. The 70-20-10 model (slide 2) reflects this: 70% from experiences, 20% from relationships/coaching, 10% from formal training.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="Kolb Stage 2: Reflective Observation">

## Stage 2: Reflective Observation

### Reviewing/Reflecting on the experience

**Guiding Questions:**
- What did I notice during this experience?
- What patterns or themes emerge when I look back?
- What perspectives did others have?
- What was significant about what happened?

**Key Practice:** Step back from doing to observe and consider

**Example:**
*"During the MISA field trip, I noticed that managers spent 60% of time in meetings, not solo work. Employees described 'collaborative culture' multiple times. The office layout—open spaces with meeting rooms—physically supports this. Comparing to my internship experience (cubicles, minimal collaboration), I see different organizational values shape different communication patterns."*

<speaker-notes>
Reflective Observation requires intentional pause—"Stop doing, start noticing." Many students struggle here because they're action-oriented. Teach them: pull out your journal immediately after experiences and write observations before you forget details. The question "What did others notice?" encourages perspective-taking—your mentor might see your question as thoughtful while you saw it as basic. Multiple perspectives enrich reflection. This stage parallels Gibbs' Description + Feelings stages.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="content" title="Kolb Stage 3: Abstract Conceptualization">

## Stage 3: Abstract Conceptualization

### Concluding/Learning from the experience

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does this experience mean?
- What theories or concepts help explain what I observed?
- What general principles can I derive from this specific situation?
- How does this connect to my existing knowledge?

**Purpose:** Move from specific experience to generalizable knowledge

**Example:**
*"MISA's collaborative culture demonstrates Goleman's EI in action—social awareness and relationship management aren't just individual skills but organizational capabilities. The open office layout reflects espoused values (collaboration) matching actual practices (frequent meetings). General principle: organizational culture is visible in physical space, communication patterns, and employee language. I can assess company fit by observing these indicators during interviews."*

<speaker-notes>
Abstract Conceptualization is theory-building. You're asking "What's the underlying pattern?" This stage requires connecting your specific experience to broader frameworks (course concepts, readings, theories). It's "abstract" because you're moving from "MISA does X" (concrete) to "Organizations do Y" (general principle). This parallels Gibbs' Analysis + Conclusion stages. Students should explicitly cite course content here: "This illustrates Week 7's concept of..." Your reflective essay grading rewards this integration (35% of grade for Critical Analysis).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="content" title="Kolb Stage 4: Active Experimentation">

## Stage 4: Active Experimentation

### Planning/Trying out new approaches

**Guiding Questions:**
- Based on what I learned, what will I try?
- How can I test this new understanding?
- What would happen if I...?
- What's one small experiment I can run?

**Critical Feature:** DOING something new, not just planning

**Example:**
*"Test: I'll deliberately initiate one collaboration per week—invite classmates to study together, propose group approaches to individual assignments (where allowed), ask mentor about collaborative projects in her work. Experiment: In next mentorship meeting, instead of asking for advice (my usual pattern), I'll share a problem I'm facing and ask 'How would you approach this?' to practice co-creating solutions rather than passively receiving answers. I'll document what happens and reflect on whether collaboration improves learning quality."*

<speaker-notes>
Active Experimentation distinguishes Kolb from Gibbs. It's not enough to write an action plan—you must ACT, creating new Concrete Experiences to continue the cycle. The word "experimentation" is deliberate: treat new behaviors as hypotheses to test, not commitments to perfect immediately. This reduces fear of trying new things (growth mindset, Week 9). Encourage small experiments: "In your next mentorship meeting, try asking 'why' three times" (experiment) vs. "Become better at asking questions" (vague goal). Each experiment generates data for the next reflection cycle.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="framework" title="Comparing Gibbs and Kolb">

## Gibbs vs. Kolb: When to Use Each

| Aspect | Gibbs' Reflective Cycle | Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Stages** | 6 stages | 4 stages |
| **Depth** | More detailed, explicit emotional processing | More concise, emphasizes action |
| **Best For** | Comprehensive reflection (essays, major experiences) | Quick cycle for continuous learning |
| **Feelings** | Explicit stage (Stage 2) | Implicit in Concrete Experience |
| **Outcome** | Action Plan (intent to change) | Active Experimentation (actual testing) |
| **Structure** | Linear progression through stages | Cyclical spiral emphasizing iteration |

**For your Reflective Essay:** Either works—choose based on your thinking style

<speaker-notes>
Gibbs provides more scaffolding—ideal for students new to reflection or analyzing complex experiences (your field trip + guest speaker essay). Kolb's simplicity enables faster cycling—better for weekly mentorship reflections where you want to iterate quickly. Neither is "better"; they serve different purposes. Some students prefer Gibbs' detail (especially those who like clear structure). Others find Kolb's four stages easier to remember and apply spontaneously. In tutorial today, students try both and identify which resonates.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="section-break" title="Part 4: Driscoll's Model">

# Part 4: Alternative Models & Application

## Simplicity for Everyday Reflection

<speaker-notes>
Gibbs and Kolb are comprehensive but can feel overwhelming for quick, everyday reflection. Driscoll & Bolton (2000) offer an elegant alternative: three simple questions. This model is ideal for field notes, quick debriefs, and when you need immediate reflection without extensive writing.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="framework" title="Driscoll & Bolton Model">

## Driscoll & Bolton's Reflective Model (2000)

### Three Elegant Questions

**1. WHAT?**
- What happened?
- What did I see/hear/think/feel?
- What was I trying to achieve?

**2. SO WHAT?**
- So what does this mean?
- So what were the consequences?
- So what more do I need to know?

**3. NOW WHAT?**
- Now what do I do?
- Now what might happen?
- Now what support do I need?

**Best For:** Quick reflections, field notes, immediate debriefs

<speaker-notes>
The genius of this model: three questions you can remember without a handout. "What? So what? Now what?" is easy to recall during mentorship meetings or immediately after experiences. Despite simplicity, it covers essentials: What = description, So What = analysis, Now What = action. The phrasing ("So what?") pushes you beyond surface description—you can't just say "X happened" without explaining why it matters. For students overwhelmed by Gibbs' six stages, offer Driscoll as a starting point.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Choosing Your Framework">

## Selecting the Right Reflective Framework

### Framework Selection Guide

**Use Gibbs when:**
- Writing comprehensive reflections (essays, major experiences)
- You need emotional processing (Feelings stage)
- You want detailed structure with explicit prompts

**Use Kolb when:**
- Emphasizing the learning cycle and continuous improvement
- You plan to test new approaches (Active Experimentation)
- You want theoretical connection (Abstract Conceptualization)

**Use Driscoll when:**
- You need quick, immediate reflection
- You're short on time or space
- You want simplicity you can remember without notes

**All three share:** Description → Analysis → Action

<speaker-notes>
Students often ask "Which is best?" Answer: "Depends on context." Your reflective essay allows any of the three—choose the one that matches how you naturally think. For mentorship post-meeting reflections, try all three across different meetings to see which generates better insights for you. Professional context matters too: healthcare often uses Gibbs, education uses Kolb, business consulting often uses Driscoll's speed. Knowing multiple models makes you adaptable.

# Reflection as a Professional Skill

## Key Takeaways

1. **Experience alone doesn't guarantee learning**—structured reflection converts experience into knowledge
2. **Three robust frameworks**: Gibbs (detailed), Kolb (cyclical), Driscoll (simple)
3. **Choose frameworks strategically** based on depth needed and time available
4. **Practice immediately**: Reflect on today's lecture using one framework before you leave campus

### Next Steps

**This week:** Use Gibbs or Kolb to reflect on your Week 2 mentorship meeting
**Tutorial:** Practice applying all three frameworks to shared experiences
**Week 6:** Apply these frameworks during MISA field trip observations

<speaker-notes>
Reflection is a skill that improves with practice. Today you learned three evidence-based frameworks; in tutorial you'll apply them. Your mentorship program is essentially 10 weeks of structured reflection practice. By Week 10, reflection should feel natural—not a chore but a habit. The reflective essay assesses whether you've internalized these frameworks or just memorized them. Closing question for students: "Which framework will you try first in your next mentorship reflection?" Have students commit out loud to build accountability.
