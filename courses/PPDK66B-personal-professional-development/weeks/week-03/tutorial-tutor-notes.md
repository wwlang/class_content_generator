# Week 3 Tutorial: Tutor Notes

**Course:** PPDK66B - Personal & Professional Development
**Topic:** Reflection Practice Workshop

---

## Session Timing

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Quick Review | 5 min | Lecture recap + success criteria (no discussion needed—keep brisk) |
| Individual Reflection Writing | 60 min | Students work independently; tutor circulates providing support |
| Peer Feedback Exchange | 20 min | Partner work—structured feedback questions provided |
| Class Share & Discussion | 10 min | 4-6 volunteers share action plans; brief meta-discussion on frameworks |
| Before Next Class Review | 5 min | Quiz reminder, reading assignment, save-your-work instruction |

**Total:** 90 minutes

**Selection for feedback:** Volunteers preferred (sharing reflections is vulnerable). If no volunteers, randomly select but give 30-second warning.

**If time short:** Reduce class share to 3 students (90 seconds each) OR skip class share entirely and extend individual writing time to 65 minutes + peer feedback to 25 minutes.

---

## Learning Objectives for Tutorial

By the end of this session, students will:

1. **Apply** one reflective framework (Gibbs/Kolb/Driscoll) to a real personal experience
2. **Produce** a 200-word Level 3 reflection demonstrating transformation (not just description)
3. **Evaluate** peer reflections using depth criteria (Level 1/2/3 identification)
4. **Prepare** for field trip reflection by practicing the frameworks before the high-stakes essay

---

## Setup & Materials

### Before Class Starts

**Materials to prepare:**
- [ ] Ensure all students can access Moodle templates (Gibbs, Kolb, Driscoll Word docs)
- [ ] Print 5-10 copies of Alt et al. prompting questions checklist (for students without laptops)
- [ ] Display timer on screen for each phase (helps keep students on track)
- [ ] Have example reflection (from tutorial-content.md) ready to show if students are confused

**Room setup:**
- Tables arranged for easy partner pairing (students should be able to turn and work with neighbor)
- If large class (>30), consider pre-assigning pairs to save transition time

**Tech check:**
- Projector works for displaying timing + instructions
- Students have laptops/paper for writing

### Materials Students Should Bring

- Laptop or notebook for writing
- Access to Moodle (for templates and prompting questions)
- Memory of Weeks 1-2 experiences (mentor meeting, self-assessments, lectures)

---

## Facilitation Guide: Phase by Phase

### Phase 1: Quick Review (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Activate prior knowledge from lecture without re-teaching.

**What to do:**
1. Display the Quick Review slide (or read from tutorial-content.md)
2. Quickly summarize the 5 key concepts (30 seconds each):
   - Reflection = structured, not just thinking
   - Gibbs = 6 stages
   - Kolb = 4-stage cycle
   - Driscoll = 3 questions
   - Depth levels = 1 (description), 2 (analysis), 3 (transformation)
3. Highlight success criteria: "Your reflection must use a framework, reach Level 3, reference course concepts, and have specific action"
4. Direct students to Assessment Handbook for full rubric (don't read it aloud—they can check later)

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Re-lecture on frameworks (they just heard this—trust the lecture)
- ❌ Ask comprehension questions ("Does everyone understand Gibbs?")—wastes time
- ❌ Get drawn into detailed questions about assessments—defer to office hours

**Transition:** "You've got the theory. Now let's practice. Here's your task for the next 60 minutes..."

---

### Phase 2: Individual Reflection Writing (60 minutes)

**Objective:** Students produce a complete 200-word reflection using one framework.

**Setup (5 minutes):**
1. Project the task instructions (Main Activity section from tutorial-content.md)
2. Walk through the four experience options (A-D) briefly:
   - A: Mentor meeting
   - B: Self-assessment results
   - C: Lecture insight
   - D: Career decision
3. Remind: "Pick ONE experience, ONE framework. Don't overthink it—any choice can lead to a strong reflection."
4. Show the workshop process timeline (brainstorm → apply → refine)
5. Start timer: "You have 60 minutes. Begin by choosing your experience and framework."

**Circulate & Support (55 minutes):**

Your role during this phase is **coach, not instructor.** Move around the room, check in with students, provide targeted help.

**Common student struggles & how to respond:**

| Student Says... | Tutor Response |
|----------------|----------------|
| "I don't have any meaningful experiences to write about." | "What happened in your first mentor meeting? Even if it felt ordinary, reflection can extract insight. Try that." |
| "I'm stuck on the Analysis stage of Gibbs—I described what happened but don't know what else to say." | "Ask: What assumption did I hold before this experience? What challenged that assumption? Also: What course concept connects?" |
| "Is this Level 3 or still Level 2?" | "Read me your action plan. [Listen] Does it say WHAT you'll do, WHEN, and HOW you'll measure it? If yes, probably Level 3. If it's vague ('I'll try harder'), it's Level 2." |
| "I'm at 350 words—way over 200." | "Good problem! That means you have material. Now: What's the core insight? Cut everything that doesn't support that. Remove redundant examples." |
| "Which framework should I use?" | "What's your experience? [Listen] If it's complex/emotional, Gibbs. If it's about skill development, Kolb. If you want speed, Driscoll. All three work—pick one and start." |
| "I can't think of a course concept to reference." | "Week 1: AI impact, context engineering. Week 2: GenAI tools, human judgment. Week 3 (today): Reflection frameworks. Any of those relevant to your experience?" |

**Valid approaches students might take:**

Students will interpret the task differently—that's okay. Here are 3-5 valid approaches:

1. **Deep dive on mentor meeting using Gibbs:**
   - Focuses on emotional surprise when mentor's advice contradicted student's assumptions
   - Strong on Feelings and Analysis stages
   - Action plan connects to PDP goals

2. **Quick Driscoll reflection on MBTI results:**
   - Efficient, focused
   - Strong on "So What?" by connecting to self-awareness and career fit
   - Action plan involves testing personality insights in real contexts

3. **Kolb cycle on learning public speaking:**
   - Uses a recurring experience (class presentations)
   - Shows how the student will experiment with new techniques
   - Emphasizes continuous improvement mindset

4. **Challenging a lecture concept using Gibbs:**
   - Student disagreed with something from Week 1-2
   - Evaluation and Analysis stages explore why they disagreed
   - Conclusion shows openness to reconsidering (or justified disagreement)
   - This demonstrates critical thinking—encourage it!

5. **Reflection on career uncertainty using Driscoll:**
   - Honest about not knowing career path
   - "So What?" explores pressure from family/peers vs. authentic interests
   - "Now What?" includes specific exploration steps (informational interviews, trying new activities)

**What success looks like by minute 50:**
- Most students should have 150-200 words drafted
- Some will be polishing; others still writing (both fine)
- A few fast finishers might be done early—encourage them to deepen their analysis or help a neighbor

**What to do with 10 minutes left:**
- Announce: "10 minutes until peer feedback. Finish your draft—doesn't need to be perfect, but should be complete."

**Transition:** "Time's up. Save your work. Now you'll exchange with a partner for feedback..."

---

### Phase 3: Peer Feedback Exchange (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Students give and receive constructive feedback on reflection depth.

**Setup (2 minutes):**
1. **Partner assignment:** "Turn to your neighbor. If you're in a row of 3, make one group of 3. Introduce yourselves."
2. **Instructions:** "You'll each read your partner's reflection silently, then give feedback using the four questions on screen. 8 minutes per person."
3. **Display the feedback questions:**
   - Framework check: Are all stages/questions addressed?
   - Depth check: Is this Level 1, 2, or 3? Where could it go deeper?
   - Action check: Is the action plan specific enough?
   - Surprise check: What surprised you about this reflection?

**Partner Feedback (16 minutes total: 8 min per person):**

**First partner (8 min):**
- 3 min: Partner A reads Partner B's reflection silently
- 5 min: Partner A gives verbal feedback using the 4 questions

**Second partner (8 min):**
- 3 min: Partner B reads Partner A's reflection silently
- 5 min: Partner B gives verbal feedback using the 4 questions

**Tutor role during feedback:**
- Circulate and listen to feedback exchanges
- Intervene only if feedback is off-track (e.g., "This is good" without specifics)
- Model good feedback if you overhear vague responses:
  - ❌ "This is great!"
  - ✅ "Your action plan is specific—'ask 3 questions per meeting'—that's measurable. But I don't see a course concept referenced. Could you connect this to emotional intelligence from Week 7 preview?"

**Common feedback issues & how to guide:**

| Issue | What Tutor Can Say (if you overhear) |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| Feedback is too nice ("Everything's perfect!") | "Great start. Now: Which stage could go deeper? Where's the course concept?" |
| Feedback is too harsh ("This doesn't make sense") | "Let's be specific: Which part is unclear? The action plan? The analysis?" |
| Partners get off-topic (chatting about other things) | [Gentle redirect] "Stay on the feedback questions—you've got 3 more minutes." |
| Student defensive about feedback | "Remember: This is practice. Feedback helps you score higher on the real essay." |

**Revise based on feedback (4 minutes):**
- Announce: "Last 4 minutes—incorporate one piece of feedback your partner gave you. You won't share this revision, but it'll make your reflection stronger."
- Students work individually to strengthen weakest section

**Transition:** "Okay, you've written and revised. Let's hear from a few of you about what you learned..."

---

### Phase 4: Class Share & Discussion (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Surface key insights from the activity and prepare students for field trip.

**Volunteer Sharing (6-8 minutes):**

1. Ask: "Who's willing to share just their ACTION PLAN section—not the full reflection, just the 'what will I do next?' part? 2 minutes each."
2. Take 3-4 volunteers (if large class, maximum 4 to stay on time)
3. After each share, ask the volunteer:
   - "Which framework did you use?"
   - "What was hardest about this exercise?"
4. Thank each volunteer (vulnerability = brave)

**What to listen for in shares:**
- ✅ Specific actions ("I'll ask 3 questions per mentor meeting")
- ✅ Measurable outcomes ("Track procrastination reduction by 50%")
- ✅ Timeline indicated ("Before next mentor meeting")
- ❌ Vague intentions ("I'll be more reflective")—if you hear this, gently prompt: "How will you know if you succeeded?"

**Meta-Discussion (2-4 minutes):**

Ask the whole class (hands up):
1. "Which framework felt most natural—Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll?" [Get show of hands for each]
2. "What strategy helped you move from description to analysis?" [Take 1-2 responses]
3. "How will you apply this when reflecting on the field trip?" [Take 1 response]

**Key message to leave them with:**
"Your first reflection feels forced—like following a recipe. By your tenth reflection, it's automatic. The field trip is coming in Week 6—you now have the tools to extract maximum learning from it. Use them."

**Transition:** "Quick reminders before you go..."

---

### Phase 5: Before Next Class (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Ensure students know what's due and how to prepare for Week 4.

**Read through the three items from tutorial-content.md:**

1. **Week 3 Quiz on Moodle (due Sunday 11:59 PM)**
   - "10 questions, 15 minutes, covers frameworks and depth levels"
   - "If you were here today and paid attention, it'll take you 10 minutes"

2. **Pre-reading for Week 4: Zimmerman (2002) on self-regulated learning**
   - "Focus on pages 64-70—three phases of self-regulation"
   - "Week 4 is about HOW to learn efficiently; today was about reflecting AFTER learning"

3. **Save your reflection in a 'Reflections' folder**
   - "You'll reference this when writing your 1,500-word Reflective Essay"
   - "Also useful for PDP Section 6—evidence of how your thinking evolved"

**Optional suggestion:**
"If you want to build the reflection habit, write one 100-word Driscoll reflection per week. 3 questions, quick debrief, huge value over time. Some professionals do this for their entire careers."

**Final logistics:**
- "Any questions about the quiz or next week's reading?" [Take 1-2 quick questions]
- "See you in Week 4—we're talking about metacognition and study strategies."

**Dismiss class.**

## Common Misconceptions to Address

### Misconception 1: "Reflection = complaining about what went wrong"

**Reality:** Reflection examines both positive and negative. Evaluation stage in Gibbs asks "What was GOOD?" first.

**If you hear this:** "Reflection isn't just problem-solving. Ask yourself: What went well? Why did it work? How can I repeat that success?"

### Misconception 2: "More words = better reflection"

**Reality:** Depth ≠ length. A focused 200-word reflection beats a rambling 500-word description.

**If you hear this:** "Quality over quantity. Every sentence should advance your analysis. Cut fluff."

### Misconception 3: "I can't reference course concepts because my experience isn't about course content"

**Reality:** Course concepts are frameworks you apply TO your experience, not topics OF your experience.

**If you hear this:** "Your mentor meeting isn't 'about' growth mindset, but you can USE growth mindset as a lens to analyze it. Example: 'My mentor's advice to embrace failure connects to Dweck's growth mindset—seeing challenges as opportunities.'"

### Misconception 4: "Level 3 means longer/more detailed"

**Reality:** Level 3 means transformative—shows behavior change, not just understanding.

**If you hear this:** "Level 3 isn't about writing more. It's about showing action. 'I now understand X' = Level 2. 'I now understand X, so I will do Y starting this week' = Level 3."

### Misconception 5: "All frameworks should lead to the same conclusion"

**Reality:** Different frameworks highlight different aspects. Gibbs emphasizes emotions; Kolb emphasizes learning cycle.

**If you hear this:** "Frameworks are lenses. A wide-angle lens and a zoom lens show different views of the same scene—both valid. Pick the framework that captures what matters most to you about the experience."

## Facilitation Tips for Quiet/Passive Groups

Vietnamese students may be hesitant to volunteer or share vulnerabilities. Here's how to create safety:

### Creating Psychological Safety

1. **Model vulnerability first:**
   - Share a brief (30-second) example of your own reflection: "When I first learned Gibbs' cycle, I realized I'd been making the same mistake in meetings for years—not reading the room. I started asking 'How's everyone feeling about this?' before proposing solutions. That's Level 3 reflection—it changed my behavior."

2. **Normalize struggle:**
   - "The first time I wrote a reflection using Gibbs, I spent 90% of my time on Description and 10% on Analysis. That's normal. With practice, it flips."

3. **Use pair-share before whole-class:**
   - Instead of asking "Who wants to share?" ask "Turn to your neighbor—30 seconds each—which framework did you choose?"
   - THEN ask: "Who's willing to share what their partner said?" (Easier than sharing your own work)

### If No One Volunteers for Class Share

**Option A: Random selection with warning**
- "I'm going to randomly pick 3 people to share their action plans. You'll have 30 seconds to prepare." [Wait 30 seconds, then use random name picker]

**Option B: Share your own observation**
- "I noticed while circulating that several of you used Driscoll for mentor meetings. That makes sense—it's quick and focused. One student connected their mentor's advice to Self-Determination Theory. That's exactly the kind of theory connection we're looking for."

**Option C: Skip class share entirely**
- If time is short or energy is low, extend individual writing time and peer feedback instead. Class share is valuable but not essential.

### Encouraging Depth in Reflections

**If you notice many students stopping at Level 1:**

1. **Ask probing questions as you circulate:**
   - "What assumption did you hold before this experience?"
   - "Why did that surprise you?"
   - "What will you DO differently next time?"

2. **Display the prompting questions checklist prominently:**
   - Project Alt et al.'s questions on screen throughout writing time
   - Remind: "If you're stuck, use the prompting questions—they unlock deeper thinking"

3. **Show the example reflection mid-session:**
   - At minute 30, if many students seem stuck, pause and show the Driscoll example from tutorial-content.md
   - Walk through: "See how they moved from WHAT (description) to SO WHAT (theory connection) to NOW WHAT (specific action)? That's Level 3."

## Cultural Considerations

### Vietnamese Education Context

**Challenge:** Students may be accustomed to:
- Objective answers (not subjective reflection)
- Describing what happened (not analyzing why)
- Avoiding emotional expression (Gibbs' Feelings stage may feel uncomfortable)
- Deferring to authority (not challenging assumptions)

**How to adapt:**

1. **Emphasize evidence-based nature:**
   - "Reflection isn't just opinion—it's applying research frameworks (Gibbs, Kolb) to your experience. You're using scientific tools."

2. **Normalize emotions as data:**
   - "Gibbs includes Feelings because research shows emotions signal learning opportunities. Surprise = assumption challenged. Frustration = skill gap identified. This is professional development, not just academic."

3. **Frame assumption-challenging as growth:**
   - "Questioning your own assumptions isn't disrespectful—it's what Dweck's growth mindset requires. Smart people update their beliefs based on evidence."

### Language Considerations

**If students struggle with English writing:**

1. **Allow Vietnamese brainstorming:**
   - "You can brainstorm in Vietnamese if that's faster. Just write the final 200-word reflection in English for assessment practice."

2. **Emphasize ideas over grammar:**
   - "In today's tutorial, I care more about reflection depth than perfect grammar. Get your ideas down—you can polish later."

3. **Provide sentence starters:**
   - "This experience challenged my assumption that..."
   - "Using [framework name], I realized..."
   - "Based on this reflection, I will..."

## Time Management Strategies

### If Running Ahead of Schedule

**Extra time after individual writing (finished at 55 min instead of 60):**
- Extend peer feedback to 25 minutes (more thorough feedback)
- Add a second revision round after peer feedback
- Allow early finishers to start Week 3 quiz

**Extra time during class share (only 2 volunteers):**
- Ask for one more volunteer
- Extend meta-discussion: "What surprised you most about your own reflection?"
- Introduce optional challenge: "Try writing a second reflection this week on a different experience using a different framework"

### If Running Behind Schedule

**Still in individual writing at 65-minute mark:**
- Announce: "5 more minutes, then we're moving to peer feedback even if you're not done. Finish your action plan at minimum."
- Reduce peer feedback to 15 minutes (6 min per person instead of 8)
- Skip class share OR do quick round: "10-second action plan summaries from 3 people"

**Behind after peer feedback (only 5 minutes left):**
- Skip class share
- Give 3-minute summary of key lessons: "Frameworks work. Depth matters. Practice for field trip."
- Quick Before Next Class review (2 minutes)

**Nuclear option (running 10+ minutes behind):**
- Extend tutorial by 5-10 minutes if room is available (communicate early: "We'll go 5 minutes over to finish peer feedback")
- OR cut class share entirely, ensure everyone completes peer feedback

## Assessment & Participation

### How to Evaluate Participation Today

**Full credit (100%):**
- Produced a complete 200-word reflection (all framework stages addressed)
- Participated in peer feedback exchange (gave AND received feedback)
- Engaged during individual writing time (visible work, not distracted)

**Partial credit (70%):**
- Produced incomplete reflection (e.g., only 100 words, missing stages)
- Participated in peer feedback but superficially
- Visible effort but struggled with task

**No credit (0%):**
- Did not produce any written work
- Absent or disengaged (phone/laptop for non-class use)
- Skipped peer feedback

**How to track:**
- Circulate with class list during individual writing—check off students who have visible work
- During peer feedback, note pairs who are on-task
- Don't collect reflections today (this is practice, not graded submission), but you can request volunteers to submit if you want to review quality

### Identifying Students Who Need Support

**Red flags during tutorial:**
- Student stares at blank page for 20+ minutes → Offer experience suggestion: "Try your first mentor meeting"
- Student asks same question multiple times → May have deeper confusion—offer to meet in office hours
- Reflection is entirely description, no analysis → Prompt with: "What course concept connects? What will you do differently?"

**Follow-up actions:**
- Note students who struggled significantly—check in via email before Reflective Essay due date
- Recommend office hours for students who couldn't complete the task
- Praise students who reached Level 3 depth—positive reinforcement builds confidence

---

## Backup Plans & Contingencies

### If Technology Fails (No Moodle Access)

**Immediate solution:**
- Provide framework stages verbally or on board:
  - Gibbs: Description, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, Action
  - Kolb: Experience, Observation, Conceptualization, Experimentation
  - Driscoll: What? So What? Now What?
- Students write on paper (collect email submissions later if needed)

### If Example Reflection Is Confusing Students

**Alternative approach:**
- Don't show the example—let them struggle productively first
- OR provide a bad example for contrast: "Here's Level 1 description-only. What's missing?" [Class identifies gaps]
- Then show strong example: "Here's Level 3. What's different?"

### If Students Finish Way Too Fast (20-30 minutes)

**Possible causes:**
- They're writing Level 1 descriptions (not going deep enough)
- They're very concise writers (legitimately finished)

**How to check:**
- Read their work briefly: "Can I see your draft?"
- If it's shallow: "This is a good start—description is solid. Now push to analysis: What assumption was challenged? What course concept connects?"
- If it's genuinely strong: "Excellent depth. Now try a second reflection using a different framework for the same experience. How does the lens change what you notice?"

### If Half the Class Chose the Same Experience

**Not a problem!** Different frameworks and different students will yield different insights.

**Turn it into a teaching moment:**
- "Interesting—many of you chose your mentor meeting. During class share, we'll see how different frameworks (Gibbs vs. Kolb vs. Driscoll) highlight different aspects of the SAME experience."

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

### After Class Actions for Tutor

1. **Review your observations:**
   - Which students struggled significantly? (Follow up via email)
   - Which students demonstrated exceptional depth? (Encourage them to share in future tutorials)
   - Overall: Did most students reach Level 2-3, or are many still at Level 1?

2. **Adjust Week 6 field trip prep based on today:**
   - If students struggled with framework application: Create a field trip reflection template with guided questions
   - If students excelled: Plan a more advanced tutorial post-field trip (comparing multiple frameworks)

3. **Communicate with instructor:**
   - Share overall class performance: "Most students reached Level 2; about 30% reached Level 3"
   - Flag any students who need support before Reflective Essay due date
   - Suggest: If many students struggled with course concept connections, consider mid-semester review session

4. **Optional: Collect sample reflections:**
   - Ask 2-3 volunteers to submit their reflections for instructor review (anonymous)
   - Use these to gauge if depth expectations are clear
   - Share strong examples (with permission) as models for future cohorts

## Frequently Asked Questions (From Students)

### "Do I have to use the exact framework structure, or can I adapt it?"

**Answer:** "Use the framework as provided—all stages/questions must be addressed. The Reflective Essay rubric awards 25% for framework application. Skipping stages = points lost. You can adapt your writing STYLE, but not the structure."

### "Can I use 'I' in academic writing?"

**Answer:** "Yes! Reflective writing is one of the few academic contexts where first-person is required. You can't reflect on YOUR experience without using 'I.'"

### "What if my reflection reveals something very personal—do I have to share it?"

**Answer:** "No. During peer feedback, you can choose a different, less personal experience to share if needed. For the Reflective Essay submission, it's only read by instructors (confidential). But if your experience is traumatic, choose a different topic."

### "Can I use the same reflection for the tutorial and the Reflective Essay?"

**Answer:** "No. Today's is 200 words on Weeks 1-2 experiences. The Reflective Essay is 1,500 words on the field trip + guest speaker (Weeks 6 + 10). Different experiences, different scope. BUT the skills you practice today transfer directly."

### "Which framework is best?"

**Answer:** "There's no 'best'—only best fit for your situation. Gibbs = depth. Kolb = cycle. Driscoll = speed. For the Reflective Essay, you can choose any of the three. Pick the one that feels most natural to you."

### "How do I know if I've reached Level 3?"

**Answer:** "Ask yourself: Does my reflection show behavior change? If your action plan says 'I will do X starting Y date and measure success by Z,' you're probably Level 3. If it says 'I learned a lot,' you're Level 1."

## Success Indicators for This Tutorial

**You'll know the tutorial was successful if:**

✅ **80%+ of students** produce a complete 200-word reflection (all framework stages addressed)

✅ **50%+ of students** reach Level 3 depth (transformation with specific action)

✅ **All students** participate in peer feedback exchange (even if reflections aren't perfect)

✅ **Students ask questions** about application ("Can I use Gibbs for my mentor meeting reflection?")

✅ **Students express confidence** about field trip preparation ("I know which framework I'll use")

✅ **At least 3 volunteers** share during class discussion (indicates psychological safety)

**Red flags that tutorial needs adjustment:**

❌ Many students can't complete 200 words (task too difficult or unclear)

❌ Most reflections are Level 1 description only (need more scaffolding on analysis)

❌ Students resist peer feedback (trust not established)

❌ No volunteers for class share (too vulnerable, or time too short)

❌ Confusion about which framework to use (need clearer decision criteria)

**End of Tutor Notes**

**Remember:** This tutorial is practice in a safe environment. Students WILL struggle—that's learning. Your job is to support their struggle, not eliminate it. By Week 11, these same students will write sophisticated reflections for their PDP without thinking twice. Trust the process.
