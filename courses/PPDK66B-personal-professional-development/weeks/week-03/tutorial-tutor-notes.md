## Detailed Facilitation Guidance

### Part 1: Quick Review (0:00-0:05)

**Setup:**
- Have three framework diagrams on whiteboard or slides before students arrive
- Gibbs: Circle with 6 arrows showing cycle
- Kolb: Circle with 4 quadrants
- Driscoll: Three boxes with "What? So What? Now What?"

**Tutor Script:**

*"Welcome to tutorial. Today we're moving from theory to practice—you'll apply all three reflective frameworks we learned in lecture so you can confidently choose one for your essays and mentorship reflections."*

**Quick Recap (2 minutes):**
Point to each diagram and ask students to recall:
- "How many stages in Gibbs?" (6)
- "What makes Kolb cyclical?" (Active Experimentation creates new Concrete Experiences)
- "What's the middle question in Driscoll?" (So What?)

**Key Point to Emphasize:**
*"All three frameworks share the same core: Description → Analysis → Action. They differ in detail level and emphasis. Today you'll experience all three and decide which works for your thinking style."*

---

### Part 2: Shared Experience Baseline (0:05-0:15)

**Purpose:** Give students a concrete experience to reflect on. Using Weeks 1-2 content ensures everyone has shared context.

#### Individual Reflection (0:05-0:10)

**Tutor Instructions:**

*"Think back to Week 1 or Week 2. Choose ONE specific moment that stuck with you—maybe:*
- *The 28% statistic about executives who can list strategic priorities*
- *Learning about AI's impact on your intended career*
- *Realizing context engineering is a new essential skill*
- *A discussion with classmates that challenged your assumptions*
- *A concept that confused you or surprised you*

*Take 5 minutes to write down:*
1. *What was the specific moment?*
2. *Why did it stick with you?*

*Don't analyze yet—just capture the experience."*

**Tutor Tips:**
- Walk around to ensure students are writing (not staring at blank pages)
- If students struggle: "What's one thing from Weeks 1-2 you told a friend about?"
- Acceptable experiences: lecture moments, tutorial activities, reading insights, personal realizations during class

#### Pair Share (0:10-0:15)

**Tutor Instructions:**

*"Partner with the person next to you. Each person has 2 minutes to share your chosen moment. Listener: just listen—no advice or analysis yet."*

**Tutor Role:**
- Time strictly (2 minutes each)
- Listen to pairs as you circulate—note common themes for later synthesis
- Ensure both partners share (sometimes one dominates)

**Common Student Selections:**
- AI impact statistics (Week 1) → sparks anxiety or excitement
- Context engineering concept (Week 2) → novel skill they hadn't considered
- Generational differences discussion → challenges assumptions about work
- "Workslop" article (Week 2) → validates concerns about AI overuse

---

### Part 3: Framework Rotation – Station 1: Gibbs (0:15-0:35)

**Setup:**
- Distribute Gibbs handout (6 stages with guiding questions)
- Ensure students have paper/notebooks for writing

#### Individual Work (0:15-0:30)

**Tutor Introduction:**

*"Gibbs' Reflective Cycle has six stages. Work through each stage for the Week 1-2 experience you just selected. The handout has guiding questions for each stage. Spend about 2-3 minutes per stage—roughly 15 minutes total. Don't overthink; just respond to the prompts."*

**Tutor Tips While Students Work:**

1. **Monitor Progress:**
   - At 5 minutes, most students should finish Description + Feelings
   - At 10 minutes, should be in Evaluation or Analysis
   - At 13 minutes, give 2-minute warning: "Finish up Conclusion and move to Action Plan"

2. **Common Challenges:**

   **Challenge 1: "I don't have feelings about a lecture"**
   - Response: "Feelings include intellectual reactions—surprise, confusion, curiosity, skepticism. What was your internal response?"

   **Challenge 2: "My analysis is the same as evaluation"**
   - Response: "Evaluation says 'This was good/bad.' Analysis explains WHY. Use course concepts: 'This was valuable BECAUSE it connects to Kolb's experiential learning cycle...'"

   **Challenge 3: "My action plan is vague"**
   - Response: "Make it SMART—add a deadline and specific behavior. Not 'I'll think more about AI' but 'I'll research 3 AI tools relevant to my major by next Tuesday.'"

3. **Valid Approaches:**
   - Some students write paragraphs; others use bullet points—both acceptable
   - Some stages will be shorter than others (e.g., Description might be 3 sentences, Analysis might be 2 paragraphs)
   - Students can skip back to earlier stages if new insights emerge—reflection isn't perfectly linear

#### Small Group Discussion (0:30-0:35)

**Tutor Instructions:**

*"Form groups of 3-4. Each person briefly shares: Which Gibbs stage was hardest for you? Which stage gave you the most insight?"*

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Keep shares brief (1 minute per person = 3-4 minutes for group)
- After groups discuss, ask whole class: "Raise hand if Feelings was your hardest stage." (Often is—culturally, Vietnamese students may find emotional reflection unfamiliar)
- Ask: "Raise hand if Analysis gave you the most insight." (Should be most)

**Tutor Synthesis:**

*"Many of you found Feelings challenging—that's normal in business contexts where we're taught to be 'professional' and unemotional. But Gibbs included it deliberately: emotional reactions reveal what matters to you (values) and create deeper memory. If you found Analysis insightful, that's the payoff—that's where learning happens."*

### Part 4: Framework Rotation – Station 2: Kolb (0:35-0:55)

**Setup:**
- Distribute Kolb handout (4 stages with guiding questions)
- Students use SAME Week 1-2 experience

#### Individual Work (0:35-0:50)

**Tutor Introduction:**

*"Now apply Kolb's four-stage cycle to the SAME experience. You'll notice overlap with Gibbs—that's intentional. Pay special attention to Stage 4 (Active Experimentation): Kolb emphasizes TESTING new ideas, not just planning them."*

**Tutor Tips While Students Work:**

1. **Monitor Progress:**
   - At 5 minutes, students should finish Concrete Experience + start Reflective Observation
   - At 10 minutes, should be in Abstract Conceptualization
   - At 13 minutes, give 2-minute warning for Active Experimentation

2. **Common Challenges:**

   **Challenge 1: "This feels repetitive after Gibbs"**
   - Response: "Good observation! Notice how Kolb's 4 stages condense Gibbs' 6. Does the condensing change your analysis? Are you covering the same ground more efficiently or losing depth?"

   **Challenge 2: "What's the difference between Abstract Conceptualization and Analysis?"**
   - Response: "Very similar. Both ask 'What's the pattern/principle?' Kolb emphasizes connecting to THEORY (course concepts). Explicitly cite Week 1-2 frameworks."

   **Challenge 3: "I already made an action plan in Gibbs"**
   - Response: "Kolb's Active Experimentation goes further—it's not just what you'll DO but what you expect to LEARN from doing it. Frame it as an experiment: 'If I try X, I predict Y will happen. I'll know I learned Z if...'"

3. **Valid Approaches:**
   - Active Experimentation can include multiple small experiments
   - Students can reference their Gibbs reflection ("As I noted in Gibbs' Feelings stage...") to save time
   - Abstract Conceptualization should cite specific course content—push students to name frameworks, not just paraphrase

#### Pair Discussion (0:50-0:55)

**Tutor Instructions:**

*"Partner with someone (can be different from before). Compare Gibbs vs. Kolb:*
1. *Which felt more natural to you?*
2. *Did Kolb's Active Experimentation change how you thought about next steps?*
3. *Which framework generated deeper analysis for you?"*

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Circulate and listen to pair discussions
- Note patterns: Do students prefer Gibbs' detail or Kolb's conciseness?
- After 5 minutes, ask whole class: "Quick poll—raise hand if you prefer Gibbs so far?" (Count) "Raise hand if you prefer Kolb?" (Count)

**Common Student Feedback:**
- "Kolb felt faster but maybe less deep"
- "Gibbs' Feelings stage helped; Kolb doesn't explicitly ask about emotions"
- "Active Experimentation is better than Action Plan—feels more like learning"
- "Four stages are easier to remember than six"

---

### Part 5: Framework Rotation – Station 3: Driscoll (0:55-1:15)

**Setup:**
- Distribute Driscoll handout (3 questions with sub-prompts)
- Students use SAME Week 1-2 experience AGAIN

#### Individual Work (0:55-1:05)

**Tutor Introduction:**

*"Final framework: Driscoll & Bolton's three questions. This is the fastest model—ideal for quick debriefs or when you're short on time. Let's see if simplicity sacrifices depth or enables focus."*

**Tutor Tips While Students Work:**

1. **Monitor Progress:**
   - At 3 minutes, students should finish "WHAT?"
   - At 6 minutes, should be in "SO WHAT?"
   - At 9 minutes, should be completing "NOW WHAT?"
   - Give 1-minute warning at 9 minutes

2. **Common Challenges:**

   **Challenge 1: "This is TOO simple—I feel like I'm missing things"**
   - Response: "Driscoll trades comprehensiveness for speed. Are you actually missing insights, or does the structure feel less secure? Sometimes simplicity forces clarity."

   **Challenge 2: "'So What?' is confusing"**
   - Response: "Ask it multiple times. So what does this mean? So what are the consequences? So what does this tell me about my assumptions? The question pushes you past surface description."

   **Challenge 3: "My 'Now What?' is the same as my Gibbs/Kolb action plan"**
   - Response: "Probably! That's fine—action steps don't change just because the framework does. What might differ: Driscoll's brevity forces prioritization. What's the ONE most important action?"

3. **Valid Approaches:**
   - Students can write very concisely (bullet points, short sentences)
   - "So What?" can have multiple answers—it's an iterative question
   - "Now What?" can include both immediate actions and ongoing questions

#### Small Group Discussion (0:05-1:15)

**Tutor Instructions:**

*"Groups of 3-4 again. Discuss:*
1. *Which framework gave you the deepest insights overall?*
2. *Which was fastest to apply?*
3. *Which will you use for mentorship reflections? Why?*
4. *Did using three different frameworks reveal different insights from the SAME experience?"*

**Facilitation Tips:**
- This is the key synthesis discussion—allow full 10 minutes
- Circulate to each group; ask probing questions:
  - "What new insight emerged in Driscoll that you didn't have in Gibbs or Kolb?"
  - "If you had only 10 minutes for a mentorship reflection, which framework?"
  - "If you have a complex, emotionally charged experience, which framework?"

**Expected Insights:**
- Gibbs provides most structure → good for students new to reflection
- Kolb emphasizes continuous learning → good for students focused on growth
- Driscoll enables quick capture → good for immediate post-experience notes
- Different frameworks DO reveal different insights from the same experience

---

### Part 6: Synthesis Discussion (1:15-1:25)

**Setup:**
- Bring whole class back together
- Have framework comparison chart visible (whiteboard/slide)

**Tutor-Led Discussion:**

**Question 1: "Show of hands—which framework will you use for your next mentorship reflection?"**
- Count responses: Gibbs / Kolb / Driscoll
- Ask 2-3 students: "Why did you choose that one?"

**Question 2: "Did anyone discover something NEW about your Week 1-2 experience by using the third framework?"**
- Get specific examples
- Point out: "This is the power of structured reflection—frameworks help you see what you otherwise miss"

**Question 3: "For the Individual Assignment reflective essay (field trip + guest speaker), which framework are you leaning toward?"**
- Remind: "The essay is comprehensive (1,500 words)—Gibbs or Kolb provide more structure for that length. Driscoll might feel too simple for 1,500 words, but if you can develop depth in three questions, it's allowed."

**Key Teaching Points:**

1. **No "Best" Framework:**
   - "All three are evidence-based and used by professionals worldwide. The best framework is the one that helps YOU reflect deeply."

2. **Context Matters:**
   - Quick reflection (mentorship notes) → Driscoll
   - Comprehensive essay → Gibbs or Kolb
   - Emphasizing learning cycle → Kolb
   - Emotional experience → Gibbs (explicit Feelings stage)

3. **Structure Enables Depth:**
   - "Compare today's structured reflection to the vague 'I learned a lot' statements. Frameworks force specificity, analysis, and actionable insights."

4. **Practice Improves Quality:**
   - "Your first reflection using Gibbs might feel mechanical. By your fifth, it becomes natural. Practice weekly in your mentorship reflections."

---

### Part 7: Before Next Class (1:25-1:30)

**Tutor Instructions:**

*"Three assignments before next week:*

*1. **Mentorship Reflection (Required):** Before your next mentorship meeting, use one of today's frameworks to reflect on your most recent meeting. Submit as part of your post-meeting reflection form. Try the framework you found MOST challenging today—that's where growth happens.*

*2. **Framework Selection (Thinking Ahead):** Start deciding which framework you'll use for your Individual Assignment reflective essay (due after Week 10). No need to commit yet, but think about it.*

*3. **Reading for Week 4:** Preview next week's readings on self-managed learning and metacognition. Notice the connection: reflection frameworks are tools for metacognition—thinking about your own thinking."*

**Final Message:**

*"Reflection is a professional skill that compounds over time. Today you practiced; in your mentorship program you'll refine it; by Week 10 it should feel natural. Use these frameworks—they work."*

## Cultural Considerations

### Vietnamese Educational Context

1. **Emotional Expression:**
   - Vietnamese students may find Gibbs' "Feelings" stage culturally unfamiliar
   - Academic contexts traditionally emphasize rational analysis over emotional processing
   - **Tutor Approach:** Normalize emotional reflection by framing feelings as "data" and "self-awareness," not unprofessional expression

2. **Rote Learning Background:**
   - Many students are accustomed to memorizing content rather than analyzing experiences
   - Reflection requires self-generated insights, not correct answers
   - **Tutor Approach:** Emphasize there's no "right" reflection—depth and honesty matter, not matching expected answers

3. **Face-Saving Concerns:**
   - Students may hesitate to share weaknesses or failures in reflection (fear of losing face)
   - Reflective frameworks require acknowledging mistakes and areas for growth
   - **Tutor Approach:** Model vulnerability by sharing your own reflection example with genuine challenges and failures

4. **Collectivist vs. Individual Focus:**
   - Reflection frameworks are individualistic (Western origin)—focus on personal learning
   - Vietnamese students may naturally reference group experiences or social context
   - **Tutor Approach:** This is valid! Encourage students to include how experiences affected relationships, team dynamics, and social learning

### Inclusive Facilitation

- **Language Accessibility:** Some students may struggle with English reflection—allow Vietnamese if needed for depth
- **Introverted Students:** Provide writing time before discussion; not everyone processes verbally
- **Diverse Learning Styles:** Offer visual frameworks (diagrams) and written frameworks (text)—students choose
- **Neurodiverse Learners:** Structured frameworks actually help students with ADHD, autism, etc.—the clear stages reduce ambiguity

---

## Common Student Questions & Responses

**Q: "Do I have to use the same framework every time?"**
**A:** "No! Different contexts suit different frameworks. Quick reflections = Driscoll. Essays = Gibbs/Kolb. Experiment until you find what works for each context."

**Q: "What if my reflection feels fake or forced?"**
**A:** "That's normal at first. Reflection is a skill—it feels mechanical until it becomes habit. The structure isn't meant to constrain genuine thought; it's training wheels until reflection becomes natural."

**Q: "Can I combine frameworks?"**
**A:** "In practice, yes—experienced reflectors often mix elements. For your essay, stick to ONE framework for clarity and rubric alignment. In personal reflections, combine as needed."

**Q: "How long should each stage be?"**
**A:** "Depends on total length. In a 1,500-word essay: Description (20%), Analysis (40-50%), Action (20%), Other stages (10-20%). Analysis should always be longest—that's where depth shows."

**Q: "What if I can't think of an action plan?"**
**A:** "Then your reflection isn't complete yet. Go back to Analysis and Conclusion—what did you LEARN? If you learned something, there's always an application. Sometimes the action is 'explore this topic further' or 'discuss with my mentor.'"

**Q: "Which framework will score highest on the essay?"**
**A:** "All three score equally IF applied well. The rubric assesses depth of reflection, integration of course concepts, and quality of action planning—not framework choice. Use the one that helps YOU analyze deeply."

## Assessment Connection

### How Tutorial Prepares Students

1. **Mentorship Program (20%):**
   - Post-meeting reflections require structured reflection
   - Students practicing frameworks today score higher on mentorship reflections
   - Framework use demonstrates "increasing sophistication" (rubric criterion)

2. **Reflective Essay (10%):**
   - Must use ONE framework as essay structure
   - Today's practice helps students choose confidently
   - Students who practice all three recognize which generates deepest insights

3. **Personal Development Plan (40%):**
   - Reflection quality determines self-awareness depth
   - PDP synthesis statement requires reflecting on patterns across assessments
   - SMART goals require analysis (what needs improvement?) and action planning

---

## Success Indicators

### Students Are Successful If:
- ✅ Complete at least one full reflection cycle using each framework
- ✅ Identify personal preferences (which framework suits their thinking style)
- ✅ Recognize structured reflection generates deeper insights than journaling
- ✅ Commit to using one framework in next mentorship reflection
- ✅ Can explain when to use each framework (context-appropriate selection)

### Tutor Is Successful If:
- ✅ All students complete framework rotation (all three stations)
- ✅ Discussions reveal genuine comparison (not just "I liked X")
- ✅ Students connect frameworks to upcoming assessments
- ✅ Students leave with actionable plans for mentorship reflection
- ✅ Class culture normalizes honest reflection (vulnerability is safe)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Students Finish Gibbs Too Quickly (Under 10 Minutes)

**Likely Cause:** Surface-level responses without depth

**Solutions:**
- Check their Analysis stage: "Did you connect to any course concepts?"
- Ask: "How does this relate to theories from Weeks 1-2?"
- Prompt deeper Conclusion: "What's the transferable principle here? Not just 'communication is important' but 'WHAT about communication?'"

### Issue 2: Students Say "All Three Frameworks Feel the Same"

**Likely Cause:** Not engaging with distinctive features

**Solutions:**
- Point to differences: "Did Gibbs' Feelings stage reveal anything Kolb didn't?"
- Ask: "Is Driscoll's 'So What?' forcing different thinking than Gibbs' Analysis?"
- Explain: "Surface level, yes, they're similar (all have description/analysis/action). But nuances matter—Kolb emphasizes testing; Gibbs emphasizes emotions; Driscoll emphasizes speed."

### Issue 3: Students Struggle to Find "Significant" Week 1-2 Moments

**Solutions:**
- Lower the bar: "Significant doesn't mean life-changing. Even 'I was confused by X' counts."
- Offer examples: "The 28% statistic? The workslop article? Learning about context engineering?"
- Reframe: "What's one thing from Weeks 1-2 you still remember? That's significant."

### Issue 4: Students' Reflections Are All Description, No Analysis

**Likely Cause:** Confusion about what "analysis" means

**Solutions:**
- Model the difference: "Description: 'She said X.' Analysis: 'She said X, which challenges my assumption that Y. This connects to Z theory because...'"
- Use course concepts: "Analysis requires connecting to frameworks. Which Week 1-2 concepts apply?"
- Ask "Why?" three times: "Why did that stand out? Why does that matter? Why is that important for your development?"

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

**After Tutorial:**
1. Note which students struggled with specific frameworks—follow up individually if needed
2. Monitor upcoming mentorship reflections—are students applying frameworks?
3. Collect informal feedback: "Did the framework rotation help or feel repetitive?"
4. Prepare for Week 4: Preview how reflection connects to metacognition (self-managed learning)

**For Next Tutorial:**
- Reference today's activity: "Remember Week 3 when you practiced Gibbs/Kolb/Driscoll? That was reflection. Today we're adding metacognition—reflecting on HOW you learn."
