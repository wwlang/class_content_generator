<instructions>
1. Create a presentation slide deck with exactly 28 slides
2. Start with a title slide containing: topic title, course code and name, university/institution, and instructor name
3. Reproduce the exact wording from the lecture content for each slide, preserving all text as written
4. Generate creative visuals for each slide: pictures, infographics, icons, and diagrams that reinforce the slide's message
5. Use minimum 18pt font for body text to ensure readability from a distance
6. Add a footer to every content slide (not the title slide) with: course code, university, topic, and slide number
7. Place academic citations (e.g., Minto, 1987) in the slide footer when referenced in content
8. Leave speaker notes sections empty
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Create exactly 28 slides, matching the lecture content one-to-one. The lecture content defines each slide explicitly, so count them to verify.
- Preserve exact wording because students receive these slides as study materials and need consistency with what they hear in lecture recordings.
- Keep speaker notes empty because detailed instructor notes will be added in a separate step.
- Maintain consistent Modern Bright Pastel Corporate styling throughout for professional brand identity.

<slide number="1" layout="big-number" title="Hook: High Performers Practice Reflection">
# 73%

**of high performers practice regular reflection**

Only 12% of average performers do

*(Gibbons, Harvard Business Review, 2020)*

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
Research shows top performers in every field—medicine, business, sports—share one habit: systematic reflection. Not just thinking about experiences, but extracting lessons to apply next time. Before we begin, quick question: How many of you kept a diary when you were younger? [Wait for show of hands] Reflection is like that, but strategic—not just "what happened today" but "what can I learn from what happened?"

**Key Example:**
Sports analogy: Athletes watch game film not just to see highlights, but to identify patterns, mistakes, and opportunities. Professional equivalent: Reflection is your "career game film." Same experience, different learning outcomes—reflection makes the difference.

**Check Understanding:**
What's the difference between just thinking about something and actually reflecting on it? Turn to your neighbor—30 seconds. [Pause] Good. Let's make this concrete with some learning objectives.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="2" layout="content" title="Learning Objectives">
## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Gibbs' 6-stage Reflective Cycle to analyze a personal experience
2. **Distinguish** between Gibbs, Kolb, and Driscoll frameworks
3. **Evaluate** reflection quality using depth criteria
4. **Design** a structured reflection for your Week 6 field trip

<speaker-notes>
Notice these aren't passive verbs—you're going to DO reflection today, not just learn about it. LO1: Gibbs is the most structured—6 stages—ideal for complex experiences. LO2: Different frameworks for different purposes (we'll compare side-by-side). LO3: Quality matters—superficial reflection won't help you grow. LO4: Practical application—field trip is coming, you need these tools ready.

Think of frameworks like different camera lenses: wide-angle (Gibbs captures everything), zoom (Kolb focuses on learning cycle), macro (Driscoll gets to the point). Before we dive into frameworks, let's connect this to your assessments.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Assessment Connection">
## How This Prepares You

**Reflective Essay (10%)** - Due after Week 10
- Uses Gibbs, Kolb, OR Driscoll to analyze field trip + guest speaker
- Today: Learn the frameworks → Tutorial: Practice → Week 6: Capture material

**Mentorship Program (20%)** - Weeks 2-11
- Post-meeting reflections require structured analysis
- Use "What? So What? Now What?" for quick debriefs

**Personal Development Plan (40%)** - Due Week 11
- Section 6 requires explaining HOW course learning changed your thinking
- Reflection = bridge between experiences and goals

<speaker-notes>
This isn't just theoretical—you'll use these frameworks in all three major assessments. Reflective Essay is specifically designed to practice deep reflection (10% of grade). You get to CHOOSE which framework—Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll—so today is your audition process. Your PDP will be stronger if you can articulate what you learned, not just what you did.

Compare: Weak PDP: "I had 4 mentor meetings and learned a lot." Strong PDP: "In Meeting 2, my mentor challenged my assumption about needing a master's degree immediately. Using Gibbs' cycle, I realized I was following social proof rather than evaluating my actual career needs. Action: I'll gain 2 years work experience first." Okay, enough setup. Let's look at the roadmap for today.

</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="5" layout="section-break" title="Section 1: Why Reflection Matters">
# SECTION 1

## Why Reflection Matters
### The Science Behind Reflective Learning

*(15 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
You don't learn from experience. You learn from REFLECTING on experience. This section establishes the foundation—why reflection isn't optional for professionals, it's essential. We'll look at neuroscience, research, and Donald Schön's seminal work on reflective practice.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="content" title="Experience ≠ Learning">
## You Don't Learn From Experience

## You Learn From **Reflecting** On Experience

**Example:** Two students attend same field trip to MISA Company
- **Student A:** "It was interesting. They have a nice office."
- **Student B:** Uses Gibbs' cycle, identifies 3 leadership principles, connects to Goleman's EI framework, creates action plan

**Same experience. Different learning outcomes. Reflection made the difference.**

<speaker-notes>
This might surprise you—just having an experience doesn't automatically teach you anything. Experience alone equals data. Reflection equals turning data into insights. This is why some people have "10 years of experience" while others have "1 year of experience repeated 10 times."

Check understanding: Think of something you've done many times but never improved at. Why? Probably because you never reflected on HOW to do it better. [Brief pause] So what happens in the brain during reflection?
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="The Neuroscience of Reflection">
## What Happens When You Reflect

**1. Consolidation**
Memory moves from short-term to long-term storage

**2. Pattern Recognition**
Brain identifies connections between new and existing knowledge

**3. Schema Building**
Experiences integrate into mental models for future decisions

**4. Neuroplasticity**
Neural pathways strengthen through conscious processing

**Bottom Line:** Reflection literally rewires your brain for better decision-making.

<speaker-notes>
You don't need to memorize this—just understand that reflection has real, measurable effects on brain structure. Consolidation: Like saving a file versus just viewing it. Pattern recognition: "This situation is like that time when..." (connecting dots). Schema building: Mental frameworks that help navigate future situations faster. Neuroplasticity: Your brain physically changes when you reflect (Week 9 will go deeper on growth mindset and neuroplasticity).

Okay, neuroscience is cool, but how do professionals actually use reflection? Let me introduce you to Donald Schön.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="quote" title="The Reflective Practitioner">
> "The practitioner allows himself to experience surprise, puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which he finds uncertain or unique. He reflects on the phenomenon before him, and on the prior understandings which have been implicit in his behavior."

**— Donald Schön, *The Reflective Practitioner* (1983)**

90,000+ citations | Most influential work in professional development

<speaker-notes>
This quote is dense—let me unpack it in plain English. "Experience surprise" means notice when reality doesn't match expectations (don't ignore it!). "Reflects on prior understandings" means question your assumptions. "Carries out an experiment" means test new approaches based on insights. "New understanding + change" equals learning that leads to action.

Example: You prepare a presentation assuming formal, data-heavy slides work best. Surprise: Audience seems disengaged despite solid data. Reflection: "My assumption was 'more data equals more credibility.' But maybe this audience values storytelling." Experiment: Next presentation, lead with a story, then data. Result: Better engagement. Schema updated. So reflection equals professional superpower. But HOW do you do it systematically?
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="section-break" title="Section 2: Three Frameworks">
# SECTION 2

## Three Reflective Frameworks
### Your Tools for Structured Reflection

*(40 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
We're going to learn all three frameworks because different situations call for different tools. This is the meat of today's lecture—you'll leave with three practical methods you can apply immediately.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="Framework Overview">
## Three Ways to Reflect

| Framework | Creator | Stages | Best For |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Gibbs' Reflective Cycle** | Graham Gibbs (1988) | 6 | Complex experiences, emotional processing |
| **Kolb's Experiential Learning** | David Kolb (1984) | 4 | Continuous learning, skill development |
| **Driscoll's Model** | Driscoll & Bolton (2000) | 3 | Quick debriefs, simple situations |

**All three work.** Your choice depends on context and preference.

<speaker-notes>
We're going to learn all three today because different situations call for different tools. Gibbs equals most detailed, includes emotions explicitly (great for challenging experiences). Kolb emphasizes learning cycle (doing, reflecting, conceptualizing, experimenting). Driscoll is fastest, question-based (perfect for mentor meeting reflections).

Examples: Field trip reflection: Gibbs (complex, emotional). Mentor meeting debrief: Driscoll (quick, focused). Skill development like public speaking: Kolb (continuous cycle). Let's start with the most comprehensive—Gibbs.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="Gibbs' Reflective Cycle Overview">
## Gibbs' Reflective Cycle

6 stages that guide you through deep reflection:

1. **Description** – What happened?
2. **Feelings** – What were you thinking/feeling?
3. **Evaluation** – What was good/bad about the experience?
4. **Analysis** – What sense can you make of it?
5. **Conclusion** – What else could you have done?
6. **Action Plan** – What will you do next time?

**Strength:** Acknowledges emotions are part of professional learning

*(Gibbs, 1988)*

<speaker-notes>
This is your template for the Reflective Essay if you choose Gibbs—memorize these 6 stages. Notice it's a CYCLE—after action plan, you'll have a new experience, and the cycle repeats. Stage 2 (Feelings) is unique to Gibbs—Kolb and Driscoll don't explicitly include emotions. This matters because emotions often signal important learning opportunities.

Example with Week 6 field trip to MISA: You observe the CEO leading a meeting. Description: "CEO asked everyone's opinion before deciding." Feelings: "I was surprised—I expected authoritarian leadership." Evaluation: "Good: team engaged. Bad: meeting took longer." Analysis: "This connects to participative leadership—trading efficiency for buy-in." Conclusion: "I could apply this in group projects." Action Plan: "In next group meeting, I'll ask 'What does everyone think?' before suggesting my idea." Let's walk through each stage with guiding questions.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Gibbs Stage-by-Stage Questions">
## Gibbs' Guiding Questions

**1. Description:** What happened? Who was involved? What was the outcome?

**2. Feelings:** What were you thinking/feeling? What do you think others felt?

**3. Evaluation:** What was good? What was challenging? What was your contribution?

**4. Analysis:** Why did things happen this way? What theory helps explain this?

**5. Conclusion:** What could you have done differently? What patterns do you notice?

**6. Action Plan:** What will you do next time? What skills do you need to develop?

<speaker-notes>
Save a screenshot of this slide—these questions are your reflection toolkit. Stage 1: Just facts, no interpretation yet. Stage 2: Emotions are data—defensiveness might mean threatened ego. Stage 3: Balance—acknowledge good AND bad. Stage 4: This is where you apply course concepts (Goleman, Dweck, Covey, etc.). Stage 5: Honesty required—"I could have prepared better" not "They should have explained better." Stage 6: Specific actions, not vague intentions.

Check understanding: Which stage do you think students usually skip? [Wait for responses] Analysis—they stop at "it was good or bad" without asking WHY. That's the difference between Level 1 and Level 3 reflection. Gibbs is comprehensive but takes time. What if you need something faster?
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="framework" title="Driscoll's Model">
## Driscoll's "What? So What? Now What?"

Three simple questions that cut to the chase:

**WHAT?** (Description)
- What happened? What did I do? What was I trying to achieve?

**SO WHAT?** (Analysis)
- Why does this matter? What did I learn? How does this connect to theory?

**NOW WHAT?** (Action)
- What will I do differently? What's my next step? What support do I need?

**Strength:** Fast, question-driven, perfect for quick debriefs

*(Driscoll & Bolton, 2000)*

<speaker-notes>
If Gibbs is a full meal, Driscoll is a power snack—quick, efficient, still nutritious. Only 3 questions but they map to Description, Analysis, Action (same as Gibbs, just condensed). "So What?" is the critical question—forces you beyond description. Perfect for mentor meeting reflections (48-hour deadline).

Example post-Mentor Meeting using Driscoll: WHAT? "Mentor said I should focus on one deep skill rather than being a generalist." SO WHAT? "This challenges my assumption that 'more skills equals more employable.' Connects to CliftonStrengths—play to signature strengths." NOW WHAT? "I'll pick data analytics as my deep skill. Action: Enroll in SQL course next semester." One more framework—Kolb.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle">
## Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

Four stages that form a continuous learning loop:

**1. Concrete Experience (CE)**
→ DO something / have an experience

**2. Reflective Observation (RO)**
→ REFLECT on the experience from multiple perspectives

**3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC)**
→ THINK / form theories about what you learned

**4. Active Experimentation (AE)**
→ TRY / test new ideas in new situations

Then the cycle repeats with a new Concrete Experience.

**Strength:** Emphasizes learning as a continuous cycle, not one-time event

*(Kolb & Kolb, 2017)*

<speaker-notes>
Kolb isn't just about reflection—it's about how adults learn from experience in general. This is a CYCLE—you keep going round and round, improving each time. Different from Gibbs (one deep dive) or Driscoll (one quick analysis). Kolb: Experience, Reflect, Theorize, Experiment, New Experience.

Example learning public speaking via Kolb: CE: Give 5-minute presentation (Week 1). RO: Notice hands shaking, audience confused during data section. AC: Theory: "I need to explain context before showing numbers." AE: Next presentation, add 2-sentence setup before each chart. New CE: Give another presentation—hands still shake but engagement better. Cycle continues. Let's see Kolb in action with a real scenario.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="content" title="Kolb Applied: Failed Group Presentation">
## Kolb in Action: The Failed Group Presentation

**Concrete Experience:**
Group presentation got a C. No coordination, awkward transitions, went over time.

**Reflective Observation:**
- You felt frustrated—your work quality didn't matter because group failed
- No one took leadership, no rehearsal, everyone worked in silos

**Abstract Conceptualization:**
- Theory: Group success requires explicit coordination, not just individual effort
- Connects to: Tuckman's stages (forming → storming → norming → performing)
- Insight: We never got past "forming"

**Active Experimentation:**
- Next project: Volunteer as coordinator
- Implement: Shared doc, mandatory rehearsal, assign transitions
- Test: Better coordination = better outcome

<speaker-notes>
Real scenario from last semester—student used Kolb to turn a bad experience into learning. CE: The raw experience (bad grade). RO: Multiple perspectives—your feelings, group dynamics, professor feedback. AC: This is where you make sense of it using theory (Tuckman's model). AE: Specific experiments to test your theory.

Key insight: Notice the student doesn't just blame the group. They extract a transferable insight: coordination mechanisms matter. This learning transfers beyond this class to any team environment. Okay, three frameworks down. How do you choose?
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="content" title="Framework Comparison">
## When to Use Which Framework

| Situation | Best Framework | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Complex experience with strong emotions | **Gibbs** | 6 stages include emotional processing |
| Quick mentor meeting debrief | **Driscoll** | 3 questions, fast, structured |
| Ongoing skill development | **Kolb** | Emphasizes continuous improvement |
| Field trip + guest speaker essay | **Your choice** | All work—pick what feels natural |
| Critical incident analysis | **Gibbs** | Deep dive into what went wrong/right |
| Weekly learning log | **Driscoll** | Sustainable over time |

<speaker-notes>
There's no "best" framework—just better fits for different contexts. Gibbs equals depth (use when experience was significant or emotionally charged). Driscoll equals speed (use for regular, frequent reflections). Kolb equals cycle (use when you'll repeat the experience and want to improve). For Reflective Essay: You choose. Some students love Gibbs' structure, others find it too long.

Check understanding: If you had to pick one framework for EVERYTHING, which would it be? Why? [Brief pause for thought] Good answers. Frameworks are tools. But quality matters—let's talk about depth.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="section-break" title="Section 3: Reflection Quality">
# SECTION 3

## Reflection Quality
### Moving from Description to Transformation

*(25 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Using a framework doesn't guarantee quality. Let's talk about depth levels. This is crucial for your Reflective Essay grade—you can use Gibbs perfectly but still get a low mark if you stay at Level 1 description.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="framework" title="Three Levels of Reflection Depth">
## Three Levels of Reflection Quality

**Level 1: Description**
"I attended the field trip. We toured the office. It was interesting."
❌ No analysis, no learning, no action

**Level 2: Analysis**
"The CEO's participative style surprised me because I expected hierarchy. This connects to Goleman's social awareness."
✅ Better—connects to theory, acknowledges surprise

**Level 3: Transformation**
"Observing participative leadership made me realize I default to directive style because it feels 'efficient.' But this misses team buy-in. Action: In next group project, I'll ask 'What does everyone think?' before proposing my solution."
✅✅ BEST—deep self-awareness, theory, specific action

<speaker-notes>
This is from Alt et al. (2022)—research on 1,312 student reflections identified these levels. Level 1 equals reporting. You're just a journalist. No value. Level 2 equals analyzing. Connecting dots, using theory. Good. Level 3 equals transforming. Changing behavior based on insights. Excellent. Your Reflective Essay will be graded on this depth scale.

Key insight: "I learned a lot" equals Level 1. "I learned X, which challenges my belief Y, so I will do Z differently" equals Level 3. Let's see what this looks like in actual student writing.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="content" title="Good vs Poor Reflection Examples">
## Reflection Quality Examples

**❌ Poor Reflection (Level 1)**
"I attended the MISA field trip. We saw the office and heard from the CEO. The office was modern. I learned that MISA is successful. This was valuable."

**Problems:** Only description, no theory, no specific learning, vague conclusion, no action

---

**✅ Strong Reflection (Level 3)**
"The CEO's emphasis on 'learning culture' initially seemed like jargon. But applying Gibbs' cycle, my skepticism revealed an assumption: 'Companies prioritize profit over people.' Observing Friday learning sessions contradicted this. Analysis using Senge's *Fifth Discipline*: learning organizations outperform. This challenges my job criterion of 'highest salary.' Revised: company learning culture equally important. Action: Research L&D budget in job applications."

**Strengths:** Honest skepticism, uses framework, connects theory, specific action

<speaker-notes>
Same field trip. Two different reflections. Which demonstrates learning? Poor example: Could have been written without attending (generic). Strong example: Shows genuine thinking—skepticism, observation, theory, insight, action. Notice the strong example admits initial skepticism (vulnerability equals authenticity).

Grading impact: Poor reflection: 40-54% (Developing). Strong reflection: 85-100% (Excellent). Difference isn't writing skill—it's depth of thinking. So how do you write Level 3 reflections? Use prompting questions.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Prompting Questions for Deep Reflection">
## Questions That Deepen Reflection

*(Alt et al., 2022 - 31-Item Validated Framework)*

**Cognitive Dimension** (Thinking)
- What assumptions did I hold before this experience?
- What evidence challenged or confirmed those assumptions?
- How does this connect to theories I've learned?

**Behavioral Dimension** (Doing)
- What specific actions will I take based on this insight?
- How will I measure if my new approach works?

**Affective Dimension** (Feeling)
- What emotions did I experience? Why?
- What do my reactions tell me about my values?

**Professional Dimension** (Growth)
- How does this inform my career goals?
- What skills did I discover I need to develop?

<speaker-notes>
Save this slide—these questions are your cheat code for deep reflection. These are validated through research on 171 students, 1,312 reflections. Cognitive equals head, Behavioral equals hands, Affective equals heart, Professional equals future. Your Reflective Essay should touch all four dimensions.

Example: Cognitive: "I assumed all tech companies were startups. MISA's 25-year history challenges this." Affective: "I felt intimidated by the CEO's expertise—reveals my imposter syndrome." Behavioral: "I'll prepare 3 questions before next guest speaker instead of staying silent." Professional: "This confirms my interest in tech but shifts focus to established firms." Let's apply this to your Week 6 field trip.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="Preparing for Field Trip Reflection">
## Field Trip to MISA (September 18)

**Before the trip:**
- Choose your framework (Gibbs / Kolb / Driscoll)
- Prepare 5 questions to ask
- Set learning objectives: What do you want to understand?

**During the trip:**
- Take notes: surprises, emotions, specific observations (names, quotes)
- Notice: What challenges your assumptions?
- Observe: Leadership style, team dynamics, communication patterns

**After (within 24 hours):**
- Write raw notes while memory is fresh
- Capture feelings honestly
- Identify 2-3 "critical moments" that stood out

<speaker-notes>
Field trip is September 18—only two weeks away. Start preparing now. Don't go in passively—reflection starts with active observation. Questions you ask equal data for analysis later. "Critical moments" equal times you felt surprise, confusion, excitement (gold for reflection).

Example: Student last year: Didn't take notes, relied on memory 3 weeks later, reflection was generic. Another student: Took notes immediately after CEO talk, captured exact quote, used in essay. Got 94%. Let's synthesize everything.

# SECTION 4

## Wrap-Up & Application
### Key Takeaways

*(10 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
We've covered a lot. Let me summarize the key points you need to remember from today's lecture.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="content" title="Key Takeaways">
## Key Takeaways

**1. Reflection ≠ Thinking**
Reflection is structured, intentional, and leads to action.

**2. Use Frameworks**
- Gibbs: 6 stages, includes emotions, best for complex experiences
- Kolb: 4-stage cycle, best for continuous skill development
- Driscoll: 3 questions, best for quick debriefs

**3. Depth Matters**
- Level 1: Description → Level 2: Analysis → Level 3: Transformation
- Aim for Level 3 in all assessments

**4. Prompting Questions Unlock Depth**
Use cognitive, behavioral, affective, and professional questions.

**5. Practice = Improvement**
Your first reflections will feel awkward. By Reflection 10, it becomes natural.

<speaker-notes>
These five points summarize 90 minutes—make sure you've got them. Analogy: Learning reflection is like learning to drive. First time: "Mirror, signal, maneuver"—consciously follow steps. After practice: Automatic. Gibbs, Kolb, Driscoll are your "mirror, signal, maneuver" until reflection becomes natural. Let's look at tutorial.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Tutorial Preview">
## Tutorial Today: Reflection Practice

**Activity:** Guided Reflection Workshop
- Choose one experience from Weeks 1-2 (mentor meeting, lecture, self-assessment)
- Apply Gibbs, Kolb, OR Driscoll
- Write 200-word reflection
- Share with peer partner for feedback

**Success Criteria:**
- Framework correctly applied (all stages addressed)
- Level 3 depth (not just description—shows transformation)
- At least one course concept referenced
- Specific action plan with measurable outcome

**Deliverable:** 200-word reflection you can reference for your Reflective Essay

<speaker-notes>
Tutorial isn't lecture part 2—you'll actually DO reflection with guidance. You choose the experience and framework. 200 words forces concision (can't ramble—must be strategic). Peer feedback helps you see blind spots. Before tutorial, let's preview next week.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Next Week Preview">
## Week 4: Self-Managed Learning

**Topic:** Metacognition & Strategic Learning

**Key Concepts:**
- Self-regulated learning (Zimmerman)
- Metacognitive monitoring
- Study strategies that work vs. strategies that feel good

**Connection to reflection:**
- Reflection = looking backward at what you learned
- Metacognition = monitoring WHILE you're learning
- Together = complete learning system

**Prepare:** Bring examples of study strategies you currently use

<speaker-notes>
Next week builds on this week—reflection is one part of learning; self-regulation is the other. Reflection equals retrospective ("What did I learn?"). Metacognition equals real-time monitoring ("Am I understanding this right now?"). Week 4 teaches you how to learn more efficiently. Resources and readings.

**— John Dewey**

---

**Your challenge:** Write one 200-word reflection this week using Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll.

Choose any experience. Practice Level 3 depth.

<speaker-notes>
John Dewey said this in 1933—almost 100 years ago—and it's still true. Reflection is THE skill that amplifies all other learning. You'll use this in every class, every job, every major life decision. It feels awkward at first, but it becomes second nature.

Closing: Who's willing to commit to writing one reflection this week? [Wait for hands] Excellent. Thank you. Questions before tutorial?
