### Slide 4 (Layout: framework)

## How This Prepares You

| Assessment | Due | Today's Relevance |
|------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Mentorship Program** | Ongoing (Weeks 2-11) | Post-meeting reflections require structured reflection on mentor advice |
| **Reflective Essay** | After Week 10 | Must use Gibbs, Kolb, OR Driscoll to analyze field trip and guest speaker |
| **Personal Development Plan** | Week 11 | Reflection quality determines depth of self-awareness and goal-setting |

**Your choice of reflective framework (Gibbs, Kolb, or Driscoll) structures your entire essay**

### Slide 5 (Layout: section-break)

# Today's Journey

**1. Why Reflection Matters**
*The reflective practitioner concept*

**2. Gibbs' Reflective Cycle**
*Six stages for deep reflection*

**3. Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle**
*Four-stage learning spiral*

**4. Alternative Models & Application**
*Driscoll's "What? So What? Now What?"*

### Slide 6 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 1: Why Reflection Matters

## The Reflective Practitioner Concept

### Slide 7 (Layout: quote)

> "The capacity to reflect on action so as to engage in a process of continuous learning is one of the defining characteristics of professional practice."

**— Donald Schön, 1983**
*The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action*

### Slide 8 (Layout: framework)

## Experience ≠ Automatic Learning

### Two Professionals, Same Experience, Different Outcomes

**Professional A (Non-Reflective):**
- Presentation goes poorly
- "That was terrible. I'm bad at presenting."
- Avoids presentations when possible
- No improvement over time

**Professional B (Reflective):**
- Presentation goes poorly
- Uses Gibbs' Cycle: *What happened? Why? What can I change?*
- Identifies specific issue: "I didn't practice out loud; I assumed reading slides would work"
- Next presentation: practices 5 times, improves significantly

### Slide 9 (Layout: framework)

## Argyris & Schön: Two Types of Learning

### Single-Loop Learning
**Detect and correct errors within existing assumptions**

Example: "My presentation failed → I'll speak louder next time"
- Surface-level adjustment
- Doesn't question underlying approach
- Limited improvement

### Double-Loop Learning
**Question the assumptions behind actions**

Example: "My presentation failed → Why did I think reading slides would engage the audience? What IS effective presenting?"
- Challenges mental models
- Leads to fundamental change
- Accelerates growth

### Slide 10 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 2: Gibbs' Reflective Cycle

## A Six-Stage Framework for Deep Reflection

### Slide 11 (Layout: framework)

## Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (1988)

```

    6. ACTION PLAN ─┘
```

**Key Feature:** Explicitly includes emotional processing (Feelings stage)

### Slide 12 (Layout: content)

## Stage 1: Description

### What happened?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What was the situation or experience?
- Who was involved?
- What did you do?
- What was the outcome?

**Purpose:** Establish objective facts before interpreting

**Example (Mentorship Context):**
*"In my second mentorship meeting, I asked my mentor about switching careers mid-life. She shared a 15-minute story about leaving corporate banking to start a social enterprise. I took notes on her decision-making process and the challenges she faced."*

### Slide 13 (Layout: content)

## Stage 2: Feelings

### What were you thinking and feeling?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What were your initial reactions?
- How did you feel at different stages?
- What were you thinking about during the experience?
- How do you feel about it now?

**Purpose:** Acknowledge emotional dimension of learning

**Example:**
*"I felt inspired hearing about her courage to change careers, but also anxious—'Can I really do that?' I was simultaneously excited (new possibilities) and scared (financial risk). Now, reflecting on it, I feel motivated to explore options rather than accepting the first job I'm offered."*

### Slide 14 (Layout: content)

## Stage 3: Evaluation

### What was good and bad about the experience?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What was positive about the experience?
- What was negative or challenging?

**Purpose:** Make initial value judgments before deeper analysis

**Example:**
*"Good: My mentor gave specific examples, not generic advice. I learned that career changes are possible with planning. Bad: I realized I haven't researched career options thoroughly—I asked surface-level questions. I could have prepared better by researching her career path beforehand."*

### Slide 15 (Layout: content)

## Stage 4: Analysis

### What sense can you make of the situation?

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why did things go well?
- Why didn't things go well?
- What was really going on?
- What theories or models help explain what happened?

**Purpose:** Deep thinking—connecting experience to broader patterns and concepts

**Example:**
*"The meeting worked well because I asked open-ended questions ('How did you decide?' vs. 'Was it hard?'). This connects to Week 7 concepts—emotional intelligence requires curiosity. The meeting could have been better if I'd used Kolb's cycle: I had a concrete experience (Week 1 class) but didn't reflect before meeting my mentor, so I missed opportunities to discuss specific confusions. My lack of preparation reflects a fixed mindset (Week 9)—I assumed reflection happens naturally rather than requiring deliberate effort."*

### Slide 16 (Layout: content)

## Stage 5: Conclusion

### What else could you have done?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What did you learn from this experience?
- What could you have done differently?
- What skills or knowledge do you need to develop?
- What patterns are you noticing in your behavior?

**Purpose:** Synthesize learning and identify development needs

**Example:**
*"I learned that career changes require financial planning and skill-building over 1-2 years—not impulsive decisions. I could have prepared questions in advance and shared my self-assessment results for personalized advice. I need to develop: (1) research skills—investigating career paths before discussions, (2) strategic thinking—connecting short-term actions to long-term goals, (3) follow-through—implementing advice rather than just collecting it."*

### Slide 17 (Layout: content)

## Stage 6: Action Plan

### If the situation arose again, what would you do?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What will you do differently next time?
- What steps will you take to develop needed skills?
- How will you apply this learning?
- What specific actions will you take, by when?

**Purpose:** Convert insights into concrete behavior change

**Example:**
*"Before my next mentorship meeting (October 10): (1) Review mentor's LinkedIn and prepare 5 specific questions based on her career path, (2) Complete VIA Character Strengths assessment and bring results to discuss alignment with careers, (3) Research 3 career paths in my Holland Code categories and ask mentor's perspective. Within 1 week after meeting: implement one piece of advice she gives and report back on results."*

### Slide 18 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 3: Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

## Learning as a Continuous Spiral

### Slide 19 (Layout: framework)

## Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (1966/2017)

```
  CONCRETE EXPERIENCE
  (Doing/Having an experience)
           ↓
  REFLECTIVE OBSERVATION ←──┐
  (Reviewing/Reflecting)     │
           ↓                 │ Learning
  ABSTRACT CONCEPTUALIZATION │ Spiral
  (Concluding/Learning)      │
           ↓                 │
  ACTIVE EXPERIMENTATION ────┘
  (Planning/Trying new approaches)
```

**Key Feature:** Emphasizes testing ideas through experimentation (not just planning)

### Slide 20 (Layout: content)

## Stage 1: Concrete Experience

### Doing/Having an experience

**What it means:**
- An event or activity you participate in directly
- "Being there" and engaging with a situation
- The raw material for learning

**Examples in this course:**
- Field trip to MISA Company (Week 6)
- Guest speaker session with Ms. Ha Linh (Week 10)
- Mentorship meetings (Weeks 2-11)
- Tutorial activities (every week)
- Using self-assessment tools (Week 5)

### Slide 21 (Layout: content)

## Stage 2: Reflective Observation

### Reviewing/Reflecting on the experience

**Guiding Questions:**
- What did I notice during this experience?
- What patterns or themes emerge when I look back?
- What perspectives did others have?
- What was significant about what happened?

**Key Practice:** Step back from doing to observe and consider

**Example:**
*"During the MISA field trip, I noticed that managers spent 60% of time in meetings, not solo work. Employees described 'collaborative culture' multiple times. The office layout—open spaces with meeting rooms—physically supports this. Comparing to my internship experience (cubicles, minimal collaboration), I see different organizational values shape different communication patterns."*

### Slide 22 (Layout: content)

## Stage 3: Abstract Conceptualization

### Concluding/Learning from the experience

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does this experience mean?
- What theories or concepts help explain what I observed?
- What general principles can I derive from this specific situation?
- How does this connect to my existing knowledge?

**Purpose:** Move from specific experience to generalizable knowledge

**Example:**
*"MISA's collaborative culture demonstrates Goleman's EI in action—social awareness and relationship management aren't just individual skills but organizational capabilities. The open office layout reflects espoused values (collaboration) matching actual practices (frequent meetings). General principle: organizational culture is visible in physical space, communication patterns, and employee language. I can assess company fit by observing these indicators during interviews."*

### Slide 23 (Layout: content)

## Stage 4: Active Experimentation

### Planning/Trying out new approaches

**Guiding Questions:**
- Based on what I learned, what will I try?
- How can I test this new understanding?
- What would happen if I...?
- What's one small experiment I can run?

**Critical Feature:** DOING something new, not just planning

**Example:**
*"Test: I'll deliberately initiate one collaboration per week—invite classmates to study together, propose group approaches to individual assignments (where allowed), ask mentor about collaborative projects in her work. Experiment: In next mentorship meeting, instead of asking for advice (my usual pattern), I'll share a problem I'm facing and ask 'How would you approach this?' to practice co-creating solutions rather than passively receiving answers. I'll document what happens and reflect on whether collaboration improves learning quality."*

### Slide 24 (Layout: framework)

## Gibbs vs. Kolb: When to Use Each

| Aspect | Gibbs' Reflective Cycle | Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Stages** | 6 stages | 4 stages |
| **Depth** | More detailed, explicit emotional processing | More concise, emphasizes action |
| **Best For** | Comprehensive reflection (essays, major experiences) | Quick cycle for continuous learning |
| **Feelings** | Explicit stage (Stage 2) | Implicit in Concrete Experience |
| **Outcome** | Action Plan (intent to change) | Active Experimentation (actual testing) |
| **Structure** | Linear progression through stages | Cyclical spiral emphasizing iteration |

**For your Reflective Essay:** Either works—choose based on your thinking style

### Slide 25 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 4: Alternative Models & Application

## Simplicity for Everyday Reflection

### Slide 26 (Layout: framework)

## Driscoll & Bolton's Reflective Model (2000)

### Three Elegant Questions

**1. WHAT?**
- What happened?
- What did I see/hear/think/feel?
- What was I trying to achieve?

**2. SO WHAT?**
- So what does this mean?
- So what were the consequences?
- So what more do I need to know?

**3. NOW WHAT?**
- Now what do I do?
- Now what might happen?
- Now what support do I need?

**Best For:** Quick reflections, field notes, immediate debriefs

### Slide 27 (Layout: content)

## Selecting the Right Reflective Framework

### Framework Selection Guide

**Use Gibbs when:**
- Writing comprehensive reflections (essays, major experiences)
- You need emotional processing (Feelings stage)
- You want detailed structure with explicit prompts

**Use Kolb when:**
- Emphasizing the learning cycle and continuous improvement
- You plan to test new approaches (Active Experimentation)
- You want theoretical connection (Abstract Conceptualization)

**Use Driscoll when:**
- You need quick, immediate reflection
- You're short on time or space
- You want simplicity you can remember without notes

**All three share:** Description → Analysis → Action

### Slide 28 (Layout: section-break)

# Reflection as a Professional Skill

## Key Takeaways

1. **Experience alone doesn't guarantee learning**—structured reflection converts experience into knowledge
2. **Three robust frameworks**: Gibbs (detailed), Kolb (cyclical), Driscoll (simple)
3. **Choose frameworks strategically** based on depth needed and time available
4. **Practice immediately**: Reflect on today's lecture using one framework before you leave campus

### Next Steps

**This week:** Use Gibbs or Kolb to reflect on your Week 2 mentorship meeting
**Tutorial:** Practice applying all three frameworks to shared experiences
**Week 6:** Apply these frameworks during MISA field trip observations
