## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Senge's Personal Mastery:** Creative tension between current reality and personal vision drives growth; avoid structural conflict (limiting beliefs); integrate reason with intuition; apply systems thinking
- **Self-Determination Theory (SDT):** Six types of motivation (amotivation → intrinsic); three psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness); identified regulation predicts performance better than pure intrinsic motivation
- **McKinsey's Seven Elements:** (1) Focus on growth, (2) Become serial master, (3) Stretch, (4) Build personal brand, (5) Own your development, (6) Do what you love (ikigai), (7) Stay vital
- **Course Synthesis:** 12-week journey from context → learning tools → self-knowledge → experiences → planning → integration
- **Lifelong Commitment:** Annual reviews, quarterly check-ins, weekly reflection, continuous learning habits

**What good work looks like in Final Oral Exam:**
- Clear articulation of self-discovery journey with specific assessment insights
- Integration of minimum 3 course concepts/frameworks across presentation
- SMART goals connected to values, strengths, and career vision
- Evidence of mentor influence throughout PDP
- Confident delivery with eye contact, professional presence
- Thoughtful Q&A responses demonstrating genuine understanding (not memorization)
- Exactly 10 minutes (±30 seconds) timing

## Tips for Exam Success

### Content Tips:

1. **Tell YOUR story** — This is YOUR development plan, make it personal and authentic
2. **Be specific** — "My VIA top strength is Curiosity" > vague "I'm a learner"
3. **Connect everything** — Show how assessments → goals → vision → course learning all fit together
4. **Don't just list** — Explain WHY it matters, not just WHAT you discovered
5. **Show growth** — "I used to think X, but now I understand Y because of Z"

### Delivery Tips:

1. **Minimal text on slides** — Visuals, keywords only; YOU provide the narrative
2. **Eye contact** — Look at examiners, not screen/notes (know content so well you don't need to read)
3. **Vocal variety** — Emphasize key points, pause for impact, vary pace
4. **Enthusiasm** — This is YOUR future; show excitement and commitment
5. **Timing** — Practice until you consistently hit 9:45-10:00; going over/under hurts score

### Q&A Tips:

1. **Pause before answering** — 2-3 seconds to think shows thoughtfulness
2. **Elaborate, don't just answer yes/no** — "Yes, and here's an example..."
3. **Connect to PDP** — Reference specific sections of your plan
4. **Admit uncertainty gracefully** — "I haven't fully worked that out yet, but my current thinking is..."
5. **Show you OWN the plan** — Not memorized, genuinely YOURS

### Mindset Tips:

1. **Reframe nerves as excitement** — Same physiological state, different interpretation (Week 9 growth mindset)
2. **Remember: Examiners want you to succeed** — They're assessing, not attacking
3. **You're the expert on YOUR plan** — No one knows it better than you
4. **Authenticity > perfection** — A genuine, slightly imperfect presentation beats a polished but robotic one
5. **This is a celebration** — You're showcasing 12 weeks of growth; be proud

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes:

- ❌ Reading assessment results without interpretation ("My MBTI is INTJ" with no insight)
- ❌ Listing goals without connection to values/strengths
- ❌ Vague statements ("I want to be successful" — what does that mean?)
- ❌ No evidence of mentorship influence
- ❌ Generic presentation that could be anyone's plan

### Delivery Mistakes:

- ❌ Reading word-for-word from slides
- ❌ Turning back to screen instead of facing examiners
- ❌ Speaking too fast (nervous rushing)
- ❌ Going significantly over/under 10 minutes
- ❌ Monotone delivery (sounds bored with own plan)

### Q&A Mistakes:

- ❌ "I don't know" with no elaboration
- ❌ Defensive responses to probing questions
- ❌ Contradicting what you said in presentation
- ❌ Long, rambling answers (be concise but thorough)
- ❌ Making up answers instead of admitting you haven't considered that angle
