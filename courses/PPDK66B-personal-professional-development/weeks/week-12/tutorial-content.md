## Part 1: Presentation Structure Workshop (30 minutes)

### Activity 1.1: The 5-Slide Core Framework (10 min)

Your oral exam presentation needs a clear narrative arc. Every strong presentation has these 5 essential components:

**1. Who I Was (Self-Discovery)**
- What did you learn about yourself through assessments?
- What surprised you? What confirmed existing self-knowledge?

**2. Who I Am (Integration)**
- How do your personality, strengths, values, and interests create a coherent profile?
- What is your 50-word vision statement?

**3. Where I'm Going (Goals)**
- What are your 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year strategic goals?
- How do they build on each other logically?

**4. Why It Matters (Motivation)**
- Why these goals? Why this career path?
- How does this align with your authentic values and strengths?

**5. How I'll Get There (Implementation)**
- What are your key strategies and first actions?
- How will you maintain accountability?

**Individual Task (5 min):** Open your PDP. Identify 1-2 key points from each of these 5 components. Write them down.

**Pair-Share (5 min):** Share your 5 core messages with a partner. Can they understand your journey in 2 minutes? If not, clarify.

### Activity 1.2: Opening Strong & Closing Strong (10 min)

**The First 30 Seconds:**
Your opening should hook attention and establish your theme.

**Weak Opening:**
"Hello, my name is Nguyen Van Anh. Today I will present my Personal Development Plan."

**Strong Opening:**
"I used to think success meant getting the highest-paying job. Then this course taught me that authentic success means aligning my strengths with work I find personally meaningful. My plan reflects that transformation."

**The Last 30 Seconds:**
Your closing should leave a memorable impression and demonstrate commitment.

**Weak Closing:**
"That's my plan. Thank you for listening. Do you have any questions?"

**Strong Closing:**
"My journey from this course has taught me that I'm CEO of my career. I'm excited to implement this plan, starting with [specific action] this week. I'm ready for your questions."

**Individual Task (5 min):** Draft your opening hook and closing commitment statement.

**Pair-Share (5 min):** Practice delivering your opening and closing. Partner provides feedback: Was it confident? Memorable? Authentic?

### Activity 1.3: Timing Discipline (10 min)

The exam is EXACTLY 10 minutes for presentation. Going significantly over or under suggests poor preparation.

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- Slides 1-2 (Introduction + Who I Was): 2 minutes
- Slides 3-4 (Who I Am + Vision): 2 minutes
- Slides 5-7 (Goals & Roadmap): 3 minutes
- Slides 8-9 (Course Integration): 2 minutes
- Slide 10 (Implementation & Commitment): 1 minute

**Practice Task (10 min):**
Using a timer, practice presenting your 5 core messages (from Activity 1.1) in exactly 8 minutes. This leaves buffer time.

If you finish in <7 minutes: You're summarizing too much. Add specific examples and details.

If you finish in >9 minutes: You're over-explaining. Cut redundant points and tighten language.

**Partner Feedback:** Did pacing feel natural or rushed? Where did they lose focus?

## Part 2: Q&A Preparation & Strategy (30 minutes)

### Activity 2.1: Anticipating Questions (10 min)

Examiners will ask questions to assess:
- **Depth of understanding:** Do you truly know your plan or just memorize it?
- **Authenticity:** Are these YOUR goals or generic aspirations?
- **Strategic thinking:** Have you thought through obstacles and alternatives?
- **Course integration:** Did frameworks genuinely shape your thinking?

**Common Question Types:**

1. **Clarification:** "You mentioned wanting to work in [field]. What specifically appeals to you about that industry?"

2. **Challenge:** "What if [obstacle] prevents you from achieving this goal? What's your backup plan?"

3. **Integration:** "How did [course concept/framework] influence this goal?"

4. **Evidence:** "Can you give an example of when you demonstrated [strength/value] you mentioned?"

5. **Reflection:** "What's the biggest way your thinking changed through this course?"

**Individual Task (10 min):** 
Based on YOUR PDP, write down:
- 3 questions you hope they WON'T ask (because they're challenging)
- 2 questions you hope they WILL ask (because you have great answers)

### Activity 2.2: The STAR Response Framework (10 min)

When answering behavioral or evidence-based questions, use STAR:
- **Situation:** Set context briefly
- **Task:** What needed to be done?
- **Action:** What YOU did specifically
- **Result:** What happened? What did you learn?

**Example Question:** "You say emotional intelligence is important to you. Describe a time you demonstrated this."

**Weak Answer:**
"I'm good at understanding people's feelings. I use this skill a lot."

**STAR Answer:**
"During a group project (Situation), our team was struggling with conflict about work distribution (Task). I noticed one member was stressed about family issues, so I privately asked how they were doing and suggested we redistribute tasks temporarily (Action). The team member felt supported, completed their part well, and we finished the project successfully. I learned that empathy requires both noticing emotions AND taking appropriate action (Result)."

**Pair Practice (10 min):**
Partner asks you one of your "challenging" questions from Activity 2.1. Answer using STAR framework. Then switch roles.

### Activity 2.3: Handling Difficult Questions Gracefully (10 min)

**Strategies for tough questions:**

**If you don't know the answer:**
"That's a thoughtful question. I haven't fully considered [aspect], but my initial thinking is [brief response]. This is something I should explore further with my mentor."

**If the question challenges your goal:**
"You raise a valid concern. I chose this goal because [rationale]. I'm aware of [obstacle] and my mitigation strategy is [approach]. I'm open to adjusting as I learn more."

**If you need a moment to think:**
"That's an interesting question. Let me think about that for a moment..." [3-second pause is fine]

**What NOT to do:**
- Get defensive or argumentative
- Say "I don't know" without attempting an answer
- Make up information you're unsure about
- Ramble while trying to figure out your answer

**Group Discussion (10 min):** 
Tutor poses challenging questions. Volunteers practice responding with grace and honesty.

## Part 3: Peer Practice & Feedback (25 minutes)

### Activity 3.1: 5-Minute Lightning Presentations (15 min)

**Format:** Groups of 3-4 students

Each student presents a condensed 5-minute version of their oral exam:
- 1 minute: Who I was → Who I am
- 2 minutes: Goals and why they matter
- 1 minute: Course integration
- 1 minute: Q&A (group asks 1-2 questions)

**Feedback Focus:**
- Content: Was the narrative coherent and authentic?
- Delivery: Eye contact, vocal confidence, pacing
- Engagement: Did you want to hear more about their journey?

**Feedback Form (each group member completes for presenter):**

| Aspect | Strength (What worked well) | Opportunity (What to improve) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Content & Clarity | | |
| Delivery & Presence | | |
| Authenticity | | |
| Q&A Response | | |

### Activity 3.2: One Improvement Commitment (10 min)

Based on peer feedback, identify ONE specific improvement to make before the exam.

**Examples:**
- "Slow down when presenting goals—I rushed through them"
- "Make more eye contact—I looked at slides too much"
- "Add specific example when discussing EI strength"
- "Practice smoother transition between sections"
- "Reduce filler words ('um', 'like', 'you know')"

**Individual Task (5 min):** Write your one improvement commitment on paper.

**Partner Accountability (5 min):** Share your commitment with a classmate. Exchange contact information. Check in with each other 2 days before the exam: "Did you practice your improvement area?"

### Mindset Reset

**Remember:**
1. **You are the expert on YOUR development plan.** No one knows it better than you.

2. **Authenticity > Perfection.** Examiners want to see the real you, not a rehearsed performance.

3. **This is a CELEBRATION, not an interrogation.** You've accomplished significant growth this semester. The exam is your chance to showcase it.

4. **Nervousness is normal.** Even experienced presenters get nervous. Channel that energy into enthusiasm.

5. **You've prepared.** You've completed assessments, engaged with your mentor, created a comprehensive PDP, practiced presenting. Trust your preparation.

**Final Reflection Question:**
What are you most proud of from your development journey this semester?

(Allow 2-3 students to share with the class.)

## Homework Before Exam

1. **Practice 5 times** with a timer
2. **Record yourself** once (video or audio) and watch/listen—you'll notice things you miss in the moment
3. **Prepare answers** to your "challenging questions" from Activity 2.1
4. **Get a good night's sleep** before the exam
5. **Review rubric** in Assessment Handbook—know exactly what's being assessed

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Practice in front of family or friends
- Visit the exam room beforehand if possible (reduces anxiety)
- Prepare 1-2 backup stories/examples in case Q&A goes deeper than expected
