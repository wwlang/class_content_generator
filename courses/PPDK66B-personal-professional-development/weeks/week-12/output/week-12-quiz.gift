// Questions: 12

$CATEGORY: PPDK66B - Week 12

::Personal Mastery::According to Senge's concept of personal mastery, what is "creative tension"?{
~The stress that comes from working too hard on personal development #Incorrect. Creative tension is not negative stress. It's a productive force for growth, not the result of overwork.
=The gap between your personal vision and current reality that generates energy for growth #Correct! Senge defines creative tension as the gap between where you are (current reality) and where you want to be (vision), which generates energy for development. See Week 12 slides 7-8.
~Conflict between your goals and your mentor's advice #Incorrect. Creative tension is internal—between your vision and reality—not interpersonal conflict with your mentor.
~The need to be artistic and innovative in your career #Incorrect. While creativity can be part of personal mastery, creative tension specifically refers to the vision-reality gap that drives growth.
####Creative tension is the fundamental engine of personal growth in Senge's framework. The greater the clarity of your vision combined with honesty about current reality, the greater the creative energy available for development. Most people resolve this tension by lowering their vision (settling), but masters use it to pull themselves toward their vision. See Week 12 slides 6-8.}

::Personal Mastery::Personal mastery is achieved once you complete your Personal Development Plan and doesn't require further effort.{
~True #Incorrect. Personal mastery is not a destination—it's a lifelong discipline and continuous process of growth, not something you complete once.
=False #Correct! Senge emphasizes that personal mastery is a discipline and process, not a position or achievement you complete once. It's about living life as a creative work, continuously clarifying vision and seeing reality objectively. See Week 12 slide 6.
####Personal mastery is defined by Senge as "the discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, focusing our energies, developing patience, and seeing reality objectively." The key word is "continually"—it's an ongoing practice, not a one-time achievement. Your PDP is a starting point, not an endpoint.}

::Self-Determination Theory::According to Van den Broeck et al.'s (2021) meta-analysis on Self-Determination Theory, which type of motivation predicts job performance BEST?{
~Intrinsic motivation (doing work because you love it) #Incorrect. While intrinsic motivation predicts high satisfaction, the meta-analysis found it doesn't predict job performance as strongly as identified regulation.
=Identified regulation (finding work personally meaningful) #Correct! The meta-analysis of 124 studies found that identified regulation—where you find personal meaning in work even if not intrinsically enjoyable—predicts job performance better than pure intrinsic motivation. This is a crucial nuance missing from Pink's popular treatment. See Week 12 slides 12-13.
~External regulation (working for rewards or to avoid punishment) #Incorrect. External regulation is the weakest form of autonomous motivation and predicts lower performance compared to identified or intrinsic motivation.
~Amotivation (lacking motivation entirely) #Incorrect. Amotivation predicts the lowest performance and engagement—it's the absence of motivation, not a type that drives performance.
####This finding challenges the oversimplification that "you must love your work to perform well." You don't need to love every task. You need to connect tasks to your personally meaningful goals (identified regulation). This is why your PDP should articulate WHY each goal matters to YOU personally.}

::Intrinsic Motivation::Dan Pink's Drive framework argues that intrinsic motivation requires three elements. Which is NOT one of them?{
~Autonomy (directing your own life) #Incorrect. Autonomy is one of Pink's three elements of intrinsic motivation—the desire to be self-directed.
~Mastery (getting better at something that matters) #Incorrect. Mastery is one of Pink's three elements—the urge to improve at something meaningful.
=Competition (outperforming others) #Correct! Pink's three elements are Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. Competition is not part of his intrinsic motivation framework—it's more aligned with extrinsic motivation and social comparison. See Week 12 slide 11.
~Purpose (serving something larger than yourself) #Incorrect. Purpose is one of Pink's three elements—the yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves.
####Pink's Drive framework identifies three elements of intrinsic motivation\: (1) Autonomy - the desire to direct our own lives and careers, (2) Mastery - the urge to get better at something that matters, and (3) Purpose - the yearning to do what we do in service of something larger. Competition, while motivating for some, represents extrinsic social comparison rather than intrinsic meaning. Consider\: Does your PDP create opportunities for autonomy, mastery, and purpose?}

::Lifelong Learning Mindset::McKinsey's "Seven Elements of a Lifelong Learning Mindset" framework includes which of the following?{
=Focus on growth, become a serial master, and stretch #Correct! These are three of McKinsey's seven elements\: (1) embracing Dweck's growth mindset, (2) developing multiple areas of mastery over time, and (3) operating in your learning zone where optimal growth occurs. See Week 12 slides 16-19.
~Compete aggressively, avoid failure, and stick to strengths #Incorrect. These represent fixed mindset thinking, not lifelong learning. McKinsey emphasizes growth, stretching beyond comfort zones, and continuous development—not competition, risk aversion, or staying static.
~Follow passion blindly, ignore market needs, and work alone #Incorrect. McKinsey's framework includes 'Do what you love' but balances it with market needs through the Ikigai framework (intersection of passion, skill, market need, and compensation)—not blind passion pursuit.
~Maximize income, minimize risk, and retire early #Incorrect. McKinsey's framework focuses on continuous growth and development throughout your career, not financial maximization strategies or early retirement.
####McKinsey's seven elements are\: (1) Focus on growth, (2) Become a serial master, (3) Stretch, (4) Build a personal brand, (5) Own your development, (6) Do what you love, and (7) Stay vital. These aren't one-time actions—they're continuous practices for career-long development.}

::Lifelong Learning Mindset::According to McKinsey's framework, "becoming a serial master" means developing deep expertise in one single area throughout your entire career.{
~True #Incorrect. Serial mastery involves developing multiple areas of expertise over time (evolving from T-shaped to M-shaped skills), not staying in one area forever. The word 'serial' indicates sequence—mastery in one area, then another.
=False #Correct! Serial mastery means developing T-shaped skills early career (depth in one area + breadth across others) and evolving to M-shaped skills mid-career (multiple areas of deep expertise). You'll have 3-5 careers in your lifetime, making continuous mastery essential. See Week 12 slide 18.
####The McKinsey framework recognizes that modern careers require evolving expertise. Early career\: build T-shaped skills (one deep vertical expertise + horizontal breadth). Mid-career\: evolve to M-shaped skills (two or more areas of deep expertise). Vietnam context example\: Digital marketing + data analytics, or finance + AI tools. Your 1-year goals should build your T-profile; your 3-5 year goals should evolve toward M.}

::Continuous Improvement::The "learning zone" in the stretch framework is characterized by\:{
~Tasks that feel comfortable and safe with no challenge #Incorrect. This describes the comfort zone, which feels safe but produces no growth. The learning zone requires challenge.
~Tasks that are so overwhelming they trigger stress responses #Incorrect. This describes the panic zone, which inhibits learning through excessive stress and anxiety. The learning zone is challenging but manageable.
=Tasks that are challenging but manageable, producing optimal growth #Correct! The learning zone represents the sweet spot—challenging enough to stimulate growth but not so overwhelming that it triggers panic or shutdown. This is where optimal development occurs. See Week 12 slide 19.
~Tasks you've already mastered and can perform automatically #Incorrect. Mastered tasks that you perform automatically reside in the comfort zone. The learning zone requires tasks you're still developing.
####The three zones model helps you calibrate goal difficulty\: Comfort zone (no growth) → Learning zone (optimal growth) → Panic zone (overwhelm inhibits learning). Example for public speaking\: Comfort \= never presenting, Learning \= presenting to tutorial group (10 people), Panic \= presenting at national conference with 500 people as your first-ever presentation. Audit your PDP goals\: Are they stretching you into the learning zone?}

::Values-Career Alignment::The Ikigai framework suggests your ideal career sits at the intersection of four elements. Which combination represents only PARTIAL alignment (not full Ikigai)?{
~What you love + What you're good at + What the world needs + What you can be paid for #Incorrect. This represents full Ikigai—the intersection of all four elements simultaneously, which is the ideal career sweet spot.
=What you're good at + What you can be paid for (but lacking meaning and passion) #Correct! This intersection represents a 'Profession'—viable and utilizing skills, but potentially lacking personal meaning (world needs) and passion (love). Full Ikigai requires all four elements. You can be professionally successful but unfulfilled if only these two overlap. See Week 12 slide 21.
~What you love + What you're good at + What the world needs + What you can be paid for + What your parents want #Incorrect. Ikigai has four elements, not five. Also, while family input can be valuable, career decisions should ultimately align with YOUR values and vision, not solely others' expectations.
~What you can be paid for, regardless of other factors #Incorrect. Focusing only on compensation without considering the other three elements (love, skill, world needs) leads to unsustainable careers lacking meaning and fulfillment.
####The Ikigai intersections create partial alignment\: (1) Love + Good At \= Passion (but may not be viable), (2) Good At + Paid For \= Profession (but may lack meaning), (3) Paid For + World Needs \= Vocation (but may not leverage strengths), (4) World Needs + Love \= Mission (but may not be sustainable). Full Ikigai sits at the center where all four overlap. Reflection question\: Where does your PDP vision sit in this framework?}

::Course Synthesis::The course emphasized that your Personal Development Plan should remain fixed and unchanging once submitted, as changing goals shows lack of commitment.{
~True #Incorrect. PDPs should be living documents that evolve as you grow and learn. Rigidity prevents adaptation to new insights, changing circumstances, and personal development. Growth mindset (Week 9) embraces revision.
=False #Correct! The course teaches that your PDP will change, your vision will evolve, and your goals will shift as you gain new insights and experience changing circumstances. What shouldn't change is your commitment to honest self-assessment, reflective learning, and continuous growth. See Week 12 slide 27.
####Week 12 explicitly states\: 'Your PDP will change. Your vision will evolve. Your goals will shift.' The discipline is not rigid adherence to a plan—it's maintaining the practices that enable continuous adaptation\: (1) commitment to honest self-assessment, (2) discipline of reflective learning, (3) orientation toward continuous growth, and (4) courage to hold creative tension between vision and reality. Recommended review frequency\: Quarterly for SMART goals; annually for vision, SWOT, and long-term roadmap.}

::Systems Thinking::A systems thinking perspective on personal development recognizes that\:{
~You develop in isolation from external systems and influences #Incorrect. This contradicts systems thinking, which emphasizes interconnections. You exist within and are influenced by family, educational, economic, and technological systems.
=You exist within interconnected systems (family, educational, economic, technological) that impact and are impacted by your development #Correct! Systems thinking recognizes that personal development occurs within and influences multiple interconnected systems. Effective mastery means understanding leverage points—where small changes create big results. See Week 12 slide 9.
~Only organizational systems matter; personal development is separate #Incorrect. Senge integrates personal mastery with organizational systems. Both individual and organizational development are interconnected, not separate domains.
~External systems are obstacles to overcome, not forces to understand #Incorrect. Systems thinking seeks to understand systems and identify leverage points for positive influence, not just view them as obstacles to push against.
####You exist within multiple interconnected systems\: Family system (values, expectations, support), Educational system (NEU, professors, peers), Economic system (Vietnam labor market, global economy), and Technological system (AI transformation, digital tools). Your personal development both impacts and is impacted by these systems. Reflection questions\: Who and what influences your development? How do YOU influence others' development?}

::Personal Mastery::In Senge's personal mastery framework, which statement BEST captures the relationship between vision and current reality?{
=Vision without truth (current reality) breeds delusion; truth without vision breeds cynicism #Correct! This captures Senge's teaching that personal mastery requires BOTH commitments\: clear vision (where you want to go) AND honest assessment of current reality (where you are). One without the other is insufficient for growth. Your PDP holds both\: vision (goals) and truth (SWOT). Maintain both. See Week 12 slide 8.
~Focus only on vision to maintain positive thinking; current reality is discouraging #Incorrect. Senge emphasizes you need both vision AND truth about current reality. Ignoring reality leads to delusion (unrealistic planning), not sustainable growth.
~Focus only on current reality to be practical; vision is unrealistic dreaming #Incorrect. Truth about reality without vision leads to cynicism (feeling stuck, no direction). You need both to generate creative tension that drives growth.
~Vision and current reality are unrelated concepts in personal development #Incorrect. Vision and current reality are deeply interconnected—the gap between them creates creative tension that drives growth. They work together, not separately.
####The two commitments of personal mastery are\: (1) Commitment to Personal Vision - clarifying what truly matters to you (not what others expect), and (2) Commitment to Truth (Current Reality) - seeing where you actually are without self-deception. Your SWOT analysis and skills gap assessment are truth-telling tools. Your 50-word vision statement and SMART goals represent your vision. Hold both simultaneously to maintain creative tension.}

::Continuous Improvement::Which frequency is recommended for revisiting and updating your comprehensive Personal Development Plan?{
~Never—once created, it should remain unchanged to show commitment #Incorrect. PDPs should be living documents that evolve with your growth and changing circumstances. Static plans become irrelevant quickly in a dynamic world.
~Daily for all components #Incorrect. While daily reflection is valuable for immediate actions and learning, comprehensive PDP revision doesn't need to happen daily—that would be excessive and inefficient.
=Quarterly for SMART goals; annually for vision, SWOT, and long-term roadmap #Correct! The course recommends quarterly reviews of SMART goals and action plans (adjusting tactics), with annual deeper reviews of vision statements, SWOT analysis, and long-term roadmaps (strategic reflection). This balances regular monitoring with deeper strategic reflection. See Week 12 slide 24.
~Only when you get a new job #Incorrect. Waiting for major life events means missing opportunities for proactive development and course-correction. Regular review enables you to create opportunities rather than just react to them.
####The recommended review cycle\: Daily (5-min journal on actions and learning), Weekly (review progress on immediate goals), Monthly (assess habits and adjust strategies), Quarterly (evaluate SMART goals and update action plans), Annually (revisit vision, SWOT, and long-term roadmap). This multi-frequency approach ensures your PDP remains a living document that guides continuous growth rather than a static artifact that gathers dust.}
