// Week 12: Integration & Continuous Growth
// Questions: 12

$CATEGORY: PPDK66B - Week 12

::Senge's Personal Mastery::According to Peter Senge's "The Fifth Discipline," what is personal mastery?{
~The process of achieving perfection in one's chosen profession #Incorrect. Personal mastery is not about perfection—it's about continuous clarification of vision and honest assessment of reality.
=The discipline of continually clarifying and deepening personal vision, focusing energies, and seeing reality objectively #Correct! Senge defines personal mastery as a continuous practice of clarifying vision and honestly assessing current reality, generating creative tension that drives growth.
~Mastering technical skills required for career advancement #Incorrect. Personal mastery goes beyond technical skills—it's about vision clarity, energy focus, and honest self-assessment.
~The ability to control others and influence organizational outcomes #Incorrect. Personal mastery is about self-development, not controlling or influencing others.
####Personal mastery generates creative tension between where you want to be (vision) and where you are now (reality). This tension drives development. See Week 12 slides 5-7.}

::Senge's Creative Tension::You've set a 5-year goal to become a senior data analyst, but you currently have only basic Excel skills. According to Senge's creative tension model, which response demonstrates productive use of this gap?{
~Feel anxious about the gap and lower your goal to 'become proficient in Excel' to reduce stress #Incorrect. Lowering your vision to match reality eliminates creative tension and stops growth. This is a common but counterproductive response.
=Maintain your senior analyst vision and systematically build skills through courses, projects, and internships #Correct! This uses creative tension productively—keeping vision constant while taking systematic action to elevate current reality toward that vision.
~Ignore the gap and hope it resolves itself over time #Incorrect. Ignoring the gap doesn't engage with creative tension. Hope without action leads to drift, not growth.
~Focus only on your current reality and abandon long-term vision as unrealistic #Incorrect. Abandoning vision eliminates the creative tension that drives development. Vision provides direction for growth.
####Growth occurs when you keep vision constant and work to close the gap from below—not by lowering your vision to match current reality. See Week 12 slides 8-10.}

::Senge's Structural Conflict::After setting ambitious career goals, you find yourself thinking\: "I'm not smart enough to achieve this—other students are more talented." According to Senge, this represents which form of structural conflict?{
~Creative tension between vision and reality #Incorrect. Creative tension is productive. This thought pattern is a limiting belief that sabotages creative tension.
=Unworthiness—the belief that you don't deserve to achieve your vision #Correct! This exemplifies unworthiness—a limiting belief about your inherent inadequacy. Overcoming it requires challenging the belief with evidence and focusing on process over outcome.
~Powerlessness—the belief that external forces control your outcomes #Incorrect. Powerlessness would sound like 'The system is rigged against me.' This thought is about internal inadequacy, not external barriers.
~Commitment to truth about current reality #Incorrect. Commitment to truth is honest self-assessment without negative judgment. 'I'm not smart enough' is a judgment, not objective assessment.
####Senge identifies two forms of structural conflict that sabotage growth\: powerlessness (external forces control me) and unworthiness (I'm not good enough). Both must be overcome through evidence and reframing. See Week 12 slides 11-12.}

::Self-Determination Theory::According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), what are the three basic psychological needs that drive human motivation?{
~Achievement, affiliation, and power #Incorrect. This references McClelland's different theory of motivation. SDT focuses on autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
=Autonomy, competence, and relatedness #Correct! SDT identifies three fundamental needs\: autonomy (feeling self-directed), competence (feeling effective), and relatedness (feeling connected to others).
~Security, recognition, and advancement #Incorrect. These are career aspirations, not the basic psychological needs identified by SDT research.
~Passion, purpose, and profit #Incorrect. This is not a research-based need framework. SDT focuses on autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
####When these three needs are satisfied in work contexts, people experience autonomous motivation, better performance, reduced burnout, and greater well-being. See Week 12 slides 13-15.}

::SDT Motivation Continuum::You're working on a challenging project that requires learning new technical skills. You don't find the tasks inherently enjoyable, but you recognize they're essential for your career development and align with your long-term goals. According to Self-Determination Theory, which type of motivation are you experiencing?{
~Intrinsic motivation—you're doing it because it's inherently interesting #Incorrect. Intrinsic motivation means finding the activity itself enjoyable. The scenario states you don't find it inherently enjoyable.
~External regulation—you're doing it only for rewards or to avoid punishment #Incorrect. External regulation would be 'I'm only doing this for the grade/salary.' You're doing it because you personally value the outcome.
=Identified regulation—you're doing it because it aligns with your personal values and goals #Correct! Identified regulation means engaging in work because you recognize its personal value, even if it's not inherently fun. Research shows this predicts performance as well as intrinsic motivation.
~Amotivation—you have no clear reason for doing the work #Incorrect. Amotivation would be 'I don't see any point in this.' You clearly see the point—career development.
####You don't need to find everything enjoyable to be highly motivated. Identified regulation (valuing the work's purpose) is autonomous motivation that sustains effort and performance. See Week 12 slides 16-17.}

::SDT Career Application::You're evaluating two job offers. Job A offers higher salary but involves micromanagement, repetitive tasks with no learning, and a competitive culture. Job B offers moderate salary but provides autonomy, skill development opportunities, and a collaborative team. Based on Self-Determination Theory, which prediction is most accurate?{
~Job A will provide greater long-term satisfaction because financial security is most important #Incorrect. Beyond adequate compensation, need satisfaction drives well-being more than salary. Job A thwarts all three basic needs.
=Job B will likely provide greater motivation and well-being because it satisfies autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs #Correct! Job B satisfies all three needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness), predicting sustainable motivation and satisfaction despite lower salary.
~Both jobs are equally motivating as long as the work tasks are interesting #Incorrect. SDT shows that work environment features matter beyond task interest. Need satisfaction predicts outcomes independently.
~Job satisfaction depends entirely on personality type, not work conditions #Incorrect. While individual differences exist, the three needs are universal human requirements according to SDT research.
####When work environments satisfy autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, people experience better performance and reduced burnout. Job A thwarts all three needs despite higher salary. See Week 12 slide 18.}

::McKinsey Seven Elements::According to McKinsey's "Seven Essential Elements of a Lifelong Learning Mindset," which element involves developing deep expertise in one area first (T-shaped) and then expanding to multiple areas of mastery over time (M-shaped)?{
~Focus on growth #Incorrect. 'Focus on growth' refers to growth mindset. The progression from T-shaped to M-shaped is about serial mastery.
=Become a serial master #Correct! This element describes evolving from I-shaped (narrow) to T-shaped (deep + broad) to M-shaped (multiple peaks of mastery) over a career.
~Stretch beyond your comfort zone #Incorrect. 'Stretch' refers to operating in your learning zone. Serial mastery is about building multiple areas of expertise over time.
~Build a personal brand #Incorrect. 'Build a personal brand' refers to professional identity development, not the T-to-M-shaped career progression.
####Careers span 40+ years and require developing multiple peaks of mastery serially—you can't master everything simultaneously. Start T-shaped, evolve to M-shaped. See Week 12 slides 19-20.}

::McKinsey Learning Zone::According to McKinsey's "Stretch" element (based on Yerkes-Dodson Law), which scenario represents optimal operation in the learning zone?{
~Only taking courses you know you'll easily ace, avoiding any risk of failure #Incorrect. This represents comfort zone—avoiding challenges leads to stagnation, not growth.
~Accepting a senior executive role with zero management experience, hoping to learn through trial by fire #Incorrect. This represents panic zone—taking a role far beyond current capabilities causes anxiety but shuts down learning.
=Taking a challenging course that requires significant effort but feels achievable with consistent study #Correct! This exemplifies learning zone\: challenging (not comfortable) but achievable with effort (not overwhelming). This produces optimal growth.
~Staying in your current comfortable role indefinitely because it feels safe #Incorrect. This represents comfort zone—safety without challenge leads to skill atrophy, not development.
####High performers spend 70-80% of time in learning zone—consistently stretched but not overwhelmed. Comfort zone \= stagnation; Panic zone \= shutdown. See Week 12 slides 21-22.}

::McKinsey Ikigai::You're passionate about environmental sustainability and skilled at data analysis. There's growing market demand for sustainability analysts, and companies are willing to pay for this expertise. According to McKinsey's "Do What You Love" element using the Ikigai framework, what does this situation represent?{
=Ikigai—the intersection of passion, skill, market need, and economic value #Correct! This scenario satisfies all four Ikigai elements\: what you love (sustainability), what you're good at (data analysis), what the world needs (market demand), and what you can be paid for (companies willing to pay).
~Delight—passion and skill without economic viability #Incorrect. The scenario includes economic viability (companies willing to pay). Delight would lack the market/payment elements.
~Profession—skill and market need without passion #Incorrect. The scenario explicitly includes passion (for environmental sustainability). Profession would lack the love element.
~Vocation—market need and economic value without utilizing your skills #Incorrect. The scenario includes skill utilization (data analysis). Vocation would lack the skill element.
####Ikigai exists at the intersection of four circles\: what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. The goal is progressively aligning all four. See Week 12 slides 23-24.}

::Course Framework Connections::Which course framework from earlier weeks is directly connected to McKinsey's first element "Focus on Growth"?{
~Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (Week 3) #Incorrect. Gibbs connects to learning from experience, not directly to growth mindset orientation.
~SMART Goals (Week 11) #Incorrect. SMART Goals connect to goal-setting methodology, not the growth mindset foundation.
=Carol Dweck's Growth Mindset (Week 9) #Correct! McKinsey's Element 1 'Focus on Growth' explicitly references Carol Dweck's growth mindset research. Believing abilities develop through effort is foundational to lifelong learning.
~Holland Code RIASEC (Week 5) #Incorrect. Holland Code connects to career interests and fit, not growth orientation.
####McKinsey integrates growth mindset as the first of seven elements because without growth-oriented beliefs, the other elements (serial mastery, stretching, etc.) are unlikely to be pursued. See Week 12 slide 25.}

::Development Cycle Integration::The lecture presented a four-stage continuous development cycle\: (1) Assess & Reflect, (2) Analyze & Plan, (3) Act & Build, (4) Adapt & Grow. Which combination of course frameworks would you use in Stage 2 (Analyze & Plan)?{
~Gibbs' Reflective Cycle + Metacognition strategies #Incorrect. These belong to Stage 1 (Assess & Reflect)—extracting insights from experience.
=SWOT Analysis + Skills Gap Analysis + SMART Goals #Correct! Stage 2 involves analyzing gaps and setting strategic direction\: SWOT Analysis, Skills Gap Analysis, and SMART Goals from Week 11.
~Habit stacking + Time-blocking + Deep work #Incorrect. These belong to Stage 3 (Act & Build)—implementing systems for consistent action.
~Growth mindset + Learning from failure + Seeking feedback #Incorrect. These belong to Stage 4 (Adapt & Grow)—responding to obstacles and adjusting based on results.
####The development cycle integrates all 12 weeks of frameworks into a continuous improvement process. Stage 2 uses Week 11's planning frameworks to translate self-knowledge into strategic direction. See Week 12 slides 26-27.}

::Making Learning Stick::Research shows that without reinforcement, people forget 90% of what they learned within a week. Based on Week 12's content on making course learning stick, which approach demonstrates active integration rather than passive learning?{
~Reading Senge's personal mastery chapter once and then filing your notes away #Incorrect. This is passive learning—consuming content once without ongoing application leads to forgetting.
~Completing self-assessments in Week 5 and never revisiting the results #Incorrect. This is passive learning. Assessment insights lose value without periodic review and application.
=Using Gibbs' Reflective Cycle every Sunday to process your week, revisiting assessment insights quarterly, and reviewing goals monthly #Correct! This demonstrates active integration through systematic practice\: weekly reflection, quarterly assessment review, and monthly goal review create continuous engagement.
~Creating a development plan in Week 11 for the assignment and not looking at it again after submission #Incorrect. This is passive learning. A plan only creates value through implementation and ongoing review.
####Frameworks only create value through sustained practice. Weekly reflection yields 52 documented insights annually. Students who integrate these practices systematically continue developing for decades. See Week 12 slides 28-30.}
