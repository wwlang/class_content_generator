---

## Tutorial Overview

**Purpose:**
This is the FINAL tutorial before high-stakes Final Oral Exams (30% of course grade). Students practice 10-minute PDP presentations, receive structured peer feedback using the official rubric, prepare for Q&A, and refine delivery. Success requires creating a supportive yet rigorous practice environment.

**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of this tutorial, students will have:
1. Delivered at least one full 10-minute practice presentation
2. Received specific, actionable peer feedback on all four rubric categories
3. Practiced answering 6+ examiner-style questions
4. Identified 3-5 concrete improvements to make before exam
5. Created detailed exam preparation action plan

**Assessment Connection:**
- **Direct:** Students practicing the exact task they'll be assessed on (Final Oral Exam, 30%)
- **Indirect:** Strengthening presentation skills, professional communication (LO8)

---

## Pre-Tutorial Preparation

### 1 Week Before

**Communication (Critical):**
- Email/announce: "Week 12 tutorial is MANDATORY exam preparation — bring draft presentation and PDP"
- Set expectations:
  - This is practice exam, not lecture
  - You MUST present to peers (participation essential)
  - Feedback will be direct but constructive
  - Come with growth mindset, not defensiveness

**Prepare Materials:**
- Print Peer Feedback Forms (1 per student × 3 = 3× class size)
  - Students will give feedback to 2-3 peers each
- Print Presentation Structure Checklist (1 per student)
- Print Q&A Question Bank (1 per student)
- Print Exam Preparation Action Plan template (1 per student)

**Technical Setup:**
- Ensure multiple spaces for small groups (breakout rooms ideal)
- Test timers (phone alarms, projector countdown, online timer)
- Confirm laptop/projection compatibility for presentations

### 48 Hours Before

**Readiness Check:**
- Survey students: "Do you have draft slides or detailed outline?"
- If <70% ready → send urgent reminder with simplified template
- Contingency: Students without slides can present from outline (less ideal but workable)

**Finalize Groups:**
- Create balanced groups of 3-4 students
- Aim for diversity: Mix strong/developing presenters, different career fields
- Avoid close friends in same group (more honest feedback)
- Prepare group assignment cards/list

**Room Logistics:**
- If possible, reserve multiple small rooms for group work (reduces noise interference)
- If single large room, spread groups to opposite corners
- Ensure each space has clock/timer visible

### Day Of

**Tech Check:**
- Projector working (for main timer during Activity 2)
- All printed materials organized
- Extra pens/paper available
- Backup timer on phone

**Mindset:**
- This is HIGH-STAKES practice, but still supportive learning environment
- Balance rigor (honest feedback) with encouragement (you can improve)
- Model constructive criticism yourself

**Time Sensitivity:**
- Tutorial is tightly timed (90 min for 4 activities)
- You MUST enforce time limits or students won't complete all activities
- Use visible timer, give warnings

---

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Orient students to tutorial structure
- Set supportive yet rigorous tone
- Check presentation readiness

**Script:**

"Welcome to our final tutorial before exams. Today is YOUR time to practice, get feedback, and refine your presentations.

**Here's the reality:** Your Final Oral Exam is worth 30% of your grade. You'll stand in front of examiners, present for 10 minutes, and answer questions for 5 minutes. It's high-pressure.

**The good news:** Today you get to practice in a low-stakes, supportive environment. Your peers will give you honest feedback using the same rubric examiners will use. By the end of today, you'll know exactly what to improve.

**Quick check:** By show of hands, how many of you have:
- Draft slides ready? [Count]
- Detailed outline but no slides? [Count]
- Still working on it? [Count]

[If many unprepared:]
That's okay. You can still participate in feedback and Q&A activities. Use Activity 1 to finalize your structure, then present from outline in Activity 2. But I strongly encourage you to finish slides before exam day.

**Today's structure:**
1. Activity 1 (15 min): Check your presentation structure against rubric
2. Activity 2 (45 min): Small group presentations + peer feedback
3. Activity 3 (20 min): Q&A practice
4. Activity 4 (10 min): Action planning
5. Closing (5 min): Reflection

**Ground rules:**
- Feedback is constructive, specific, kind
- Everyone presents (no opting out)
- Strict time limits (fair practice for real exam)
- Growth mindset: Feedback = gift, not attack

Let's begin. Activity 1..."

---

### Activity 1: Presentation Structure Calibration (15 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Students audit their presentations against rubric requirements
- Identify content gaps before practicing
- Ensure foundational elements are present

**Facilitation Steps:**

**1. Distribute Materials (2 min):**
- Hand out Presentation Structure Checklist
- Display checklist on projector if available

**2. Individual Work (10 min):**
- Students work independently, checking off components
- Circulate to answer questions, spot-check common issues

**Common Issues You'll See:**
- Missing vision statement (required!)
- No course integration slide (15% of rubric!)
- All text slides, no visuals
- Too many slides (>12) or too few (<10)
- Goals listed but not connected to values/strengths

**Intervention Strategy:**
- For students missing critical elements: "This is a gap. How will you address it before exam?"
- For structural issues: "Consider combining slides X and Y to make room for Z"
- For visual deficiency: "What image or diagram could replace this text?"

**3. Gap Analysis (3 min):**
- Students identify 1-3 top gaps
- Write action items

**Tutor Checkpoint:**
- Ask: "Who identified a critical gap they didn't realize before?"
- Normalize: "This is why we practice—to find and fix issues"

**Transition (1 min):**
"Great. Now you know what your presentation needs. Let's practice delivering it—Activity 2, small group presentations..."

---

### Activity 2: Small Group Presentations & Peer Feedback (45 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Students present full 10-minute PDP presentation
- Receive structured feedback using official rubric
- Experience time pressure and peer audience

**Facilitation Steps:**

**1. Group Assignments (2 min):**
- Announce groups (3-4 students each)
- Assign spaces (different rooms or corners)
- Distribute Peer Feedback Forms (3 per student)

**Groups of 3 (Ideal):**
- Each student presents, receives feedback from 2 peers
- Total time: 13 min × 3 students = 39 min (fits in 45-min window)

**Groups of 4 (If Necessary):**
- Tighter timing: 10 min present + 2 min feedback = 12 min × 4 = 48 min
- Still workable but rushed

**2. Explain Process (3 min):**

"Here's how this works:

**Presenter:** Deliver your full 10-minute presentation. Pretend we're examiners—this is the real deal.

**Peers:** Listen actively, take notes on Peer Feedback Form. Use the rubric criteria:
- Content & Self-Awareness (35%)
- Goals & Strategic Thinking (25%)
- Course Learning Integration (15%)
- Delivery & Presence (25%)

**Timekeeper:** One peer tracks time. Give a 2-minute warning signal (raise hand, tap table). Stop presenter at 10:30 if they're going over.

**Feedback:** After presentation, 3 minutes for peers to share feedback. Be specific:
- Start with strengths (what worked well)
- Then areas for improvement (what to change)
- Give scores (for practice, not official)

**Rotation:** Next presenter goes. Repeat until all have presented.

**Questions?**

Okay, you have 40 minutes for presentations. Go to your spaces—start now!"

**3. Monitor Groups (35 min):**

**Your Role:**
- Circulate between groups
- Listen to 1-2 minutes of each presentation
- Observe feedback quality
- Troubleshoot issues

**What to Listen For:**

**Strong Presentations:**
- Clear structure (follows rubric components)
- Specific details (actual assessment results, real goals)
- Authentic delivery (not robotic)
- Good timing (near 10 min)

**Weak Presentations:**
- Reading slides word-for-word
- Vague generalities ("I want to be successful")
- No course integration mentioned
- Significant over/under time

**Intervention Points:**

**If a presenter is going WAY over time (>11 min):**
- Signal timekeeper to stop them politely
- Note: "In real exam, examiners will stop you—practice managing time"

**If feedback is too vague:**
- Jump in: "Can you be more specific? What exactly should they change?"
- Model: "I noticed you didn't mention your mentor—that's 20% of the rubric"

**If feedback is harsh/unconstructive:**
- Intervene: "Remember, we're helping each other improve. How can you phrase that constructively?"

**If a student refuses to present:**
- Private conversation: "I understand nerves, but the exam is mandatory. Use today to practice in a safe space."
- If truly paralyzed: "Present to just me after tutorial"

**4. Time Warnings:**
- At 30 min: "You should be on your 2nd or 3rd presenter by now"
- At 40 min: "Wrap up current presenter, you have 5 minutes left"
- At 45 min: "Finish feedback and return to main room"

**5. Reconvene (5 min buffer):**
- Call groups back together
- Quick check: "Everyone presented? Everyone received feedback?"

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Student has no slides | Present from outline; focus feedback on content clarity |
| Group finishes early | Great! Use extra time for Q&A practice (Activity 3) |
| Group way behind | Stop after 2 presenters, remaining students present to you later |
| Technical issues | Present without slides; describe what slides would show |

**Transition:**
"You've now experienced the presentation. Let's prepare for the harder part—the Q&A session..."

---

### Activity 3: Q&A Preparation & Practice (20 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Students practice answering examiner-style questions
- Identify vulnerable areas in their plans
- Develop strategies for thoughtful responses

**Facilitation Steps:**

**1. Explain Importance (2 min):**

"The presentation is 10 minutes—you can rehearse and polish it. The Q&A is 5 minutes—you can't script it. This is where examiners really assess depth.

They'll ask things like:
- 'Why this goal? What if circumstances change?'
- 'Give me an example of when you demonstrated this strength.'
- 'How will you prevent burnout?'

**What they're testing:**
- Do you actually UNDERSTAND your plan, or just memorize it?
- Can you think on your feet?
- Is this authentic, or something you made up for a grade?

**Good Q&A = Thoughtful, specific, connected to your PDP
Bad Q&A = 'Um, I don't know' or generic rambling**

Let's practice."

**2. Distribute Question Bank (1 min):**
- Hand out or display Q&A Question Bank (from tutorial-content.md)
- Point out 20 sample questions

**3. Pair Practice (12 min):**

"Find a partner—ideally NOT from your presentation group, so you hear fresh questions.

**Process:**
- Partner A: Pick 3 questions, ask Partner B
- Partner B: Answer as if in exam (1-2 min each)
- Partner A: Feedback on depth, specificity, authenticity
- Switch roles

You have 12 minutes. Go!"

**Circulate and Coach:**

**Listen for:**

**Strong Answers:**
- Pause to think (2-3 seconds)
- Specific examples: "In Week 6 field trip, I noticed..."
- Connected to PDP: "As I mentioned in my vision statement..."
- Concise but thorough (1-2 min, not 30 sec or 5 min)

**Weak Answers:**
- Immediate "I don't know" with no elaboration
- Generic: "I'll work hard and stay motivated"
- Contradicts presentation content
- Rambling without clear point

**Coaching Interventions:**

**If student says "I don't know":**
- "What's your best guess? There's no perfect answer—show your thinking."

**If answer is too vague:**
- "Can you give me a specific example from the semester?"

**If answer is too long:**
- "Let me stop you. In real exam, aim for 1-2 min per question. Tighten your response."

**4. Vulnerability Assessment (5 min):**

"Now, identify YOUR 3 most difficult questions. What types of questions make you nervous?

Write them down and prepare talking points. These are your homework areas."

**Students complete Vulnerability Assessment section independently.**

**Common Vulnerabilities (reassure students these are normal):**

- Questions about contradictions in assessments
- "What if X goal fails?"—backup plan questions
- Connecting course concepts (if they didn't pay attention)
- Defending ambitious goals (imposter syndrome)

**Transition:**
"You now know what to strengthen. Let's create action plans—Activity 4..."

---

### Activity 4: Refinement & Action Planning (10 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Students convert feedback into concrete improvements
- Create specific exam preparation timeline
- Commit to practice schedule

**Facilitation Steps:**

**1. Distribute Action Plan Template (1 min):**
- Hand out Exam Preparation Action Plan
- Or have students use one from tutorial-content.md

**2. Individual Planning (7 min):**

"Based on peer feedback and Q&A practice, create your exam prep plan.

**Include:**
- Top 3-5 improvements to make (be specific!)
- Practice schedule (minimum 3 full run-throughs before exam)
- Q&A vulnerable areas to prep
- Technical checklist (slides, USB, outfit)

This is YOUR roadmap for the next few days. Take it seriously."

**Circulate and Check:**

**Red Flags:**
- No specific actions ("I'll practice more" → "I'll practice 3× with timer, targeting 9:50")
- No practice scheduled (MUST rehearse!)
- Ignoring major feedback (e.g., peers said "no course integration," student doesn't plan to add)

**Green Flags:**
- Specific, dated action items
- Multiple practice sessions scheduled
- Addressed top feedback points
- Realistic (not "practice 10 times tomorrow")

**3. Accountability Prompt (2 min):**

"Who will you practice with before exam? Turn to someone in this room and exchange contact info. Schedule a practice session together."

**Why This Matters:**
- Peer accountability increases follow-through
- External practice (not just roommate) gives better feedback
- Builds support network for exam stress

---

### Closing Reflection (5 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Acknowledge effort and growth
- Inspire confidence
- Clarify next steps

**Facilitation Script:**

"We've completed an intensive practice session. Before you go, quick reflection:

**Question 1:** What's one thing you're doing well in your presentation that you hadn't realized before today? [Call on 3-4 volunteers]

[Students share strengths]

"Great. Remember these strengths on exam day.

**Question 2:** What's one specific improvement you're committing to before the exam? [Call on 3-4 different volunteers]

[Students share commitments]

"Excellent. I'll hold you to that—and more importantly, you should hold yourselves.

**Question 3:** What are you most excited to share in your presentation? [Call on 2-3 volunteers]

[Students share excitement]

"THAT energy—bring it to the exam. The examiners want to see your passion and growth.

**Final thoughts:**

You've spent 12 weeks on self-discovery, strategic planning, and skill development. You've completed five assessments, built mentor relationships, reflected on experiences, and created comprehensive development plans.

**You are ready.**

Not perfect—no one is. But ready.

**Between now and exam:**
1. Incorporate today's feedback
2. Practice at least 3 times (time yourself!)
3. Prep your Q&A vulnerable areas
4. Take care of yourself (sleep, eat, breathe—Week 12 Element 7!)

**On exam day:**
- Arrive early
- Breathe
- Remember: You're the expert on YOUR plan
- Tell your story authentically
- Trust your preparation

**I believe in you. You've got this.**

Questions?"

[Answer any final questions]

"See you at exams. Good luck!"

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Student didn't bring slides/outline

**Solution:**
- They can still participate in peer feedback (watch others, give feedback)
- Use Activity 1 to structure outline on paper
- Activity 4 becomes critical: Must finalize slides immediately after tutorial
- Private conversation: "You're behind. Let me know if you need help catching up."

### Issue: Groups finish Activity 2 early

**Solution:**
- Great! Direct them to start Activity 3 (Q&A practice)
- Or do second round of feedback with deeper focus on one rubric category
- Advanced: Practice with stricter timing (examiners less forgiving than peers)

### Issue: Groups running very late in Activity 2

**Solution:**
- At 40-min mark, assess: Can they finish one more presenter in 5 min?
- If yes, let them finish
- If no, stop and move to Activity 3
- Students who didn't present: Offer to watch their presentation during office hours

### Issue: Feedback is too nice (not useful)

**Intervention:**
- Pause group, model better feedback: "I noticed you didn't mention your MBTI type, which is required by the rubric. Add that to slide 2."
- Prompt: "What's ONE thing that would make this presentation stronger?"
- Remind: "Kindness isn't hiding problems—it's helping them fix issues before exams"

### Issue: Feedback is too harsh (demoralizing)

**Intervention:**
- Stop immediately, reframe
- "Remember, we start with strengths, THEN areas for improvement"
- Model constructive phrasing: "Instead of 'This is boring,' try 'Adding a personal story here would engage the audience better'"

### Issue: Student becomes emotional (crying, shutting down)

**Response:**
- Pause, take them aside privately
- Empathize: "I know this feels vulnerable. That's normal."
- Reframe: "Feedback now = better exam performance = higher grade"
- Option: "Do you want to continue, or take a break and present to me separately?"
- Follow up after tutorial if needed

### Issue: Technical problems (projector, laptop compatibility)

**Prevention:**
- Test beforehand
- Have backup plan: Present without slides (describe content)

**If it happens:**
- Don't waste 10 minutes troubleshooting
- Student presents verbally, peers imagine slides
- Note: "For real exam, always bring USB backup"

## Common Presentation Weaknesses & Coaching Tips

### Weakness: Reading slides word-for-word

**Coaching:**
- "Your slides should have keywords, not full sentences. YOU provide the narrative."
- "Practice until you know content so well you can talk naturally"
- "Imagine you're telling a friend about your future, not reading a script"

### Weakness: No eye contact (staring at screen/notes)

**Coaching:**
- "Examiners need to feel connected to you. Make eye contact at least 50% of the time."
- "Glance at slides for reminder, then turn to audience to explain"

### Weakness: Speaking too fast (nervous rushing)

**Coaching:**
- "Slow down. Pause between major points. Let ideas sink in."
- "If you finish in 8 minutes, you're going too fast—add depth, not speed"

### Weakness: Monotone delivery

**Coaching:**
- "This is YOUR future—show some excitement! Vary your tone, emphasize key words."
- "Where are you most passionate? Let that energy come through."

### Weakness: Vague, generic content

**Coaching:**
- "Be specific. Not 'I'm a good communicator'—say 'My VIA Social Intelligence strength shows up when I mediate group conflicts, like in Week X tutorial.'"

### Weakness: No connection between slides (disjointed)

**Coaching:**
- "Use transitions. 'Now that you know my strengths, let me show how they inform my goals...'"

### Weakness: Running over/under time significantly

**Coaching:**
- "10 minutes is non-negotiable. Practice with timer until you consistently hit 9:45-10:00."
- If under: "Add depth—more examples, explain WHY behind goals"
- If over: "Cut less important details, focus on core narrative"

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

### Immediately After Tutorial:

**Reflection for Next Time:**
- What went well? (strengths to keep)
- What didn't work? (adjustments needed)
- Which students need additional support?

**Identify At-Risk Students:**
- Who didn't present (lack of preparation)?
- Who struggled significantly (weak content or delivery)?
- Who seems unprepared for exam?

**Reach Out (within 24 hours):**
- Email students who need help
- Offer brief office hours for extra practice
- Provide encouragement to those who seemed discouraged

### Before Exams:

**Final Reminders (3 days before):**
- Email: "Exam checklist: slides finalized, practiced 3×, USB backup, professional outfit, 15 min early"
- "Review rubric one last time—examiners use this to score you"
- "Breathe. You're prepared. Trust your work."

**Day Before Exams:**
- Send motivational message: "You've got this. Be authentic, be confident, be YOU."

### During Exams:

**If You're Evaluating:**
- Use tutorial insights to contextualize performance (student who struggled in tutorial but improved = growth)
- Be fair but rigorous (use rubric consistently)
- Remember: They've worked hard for 12 weeks

**If Other Faculty Evaluating:**
- Brief them on common presentation patterns (if appropriate)
- Share any student accommodations needed

## Success Metrics

**This tutorial succeeds if:**

1. **90%+ students presented** (high participation)
2. **Students received specific feedback** (not just "good job")
3. **Action plans created** (concrete next steps)
4. **Students leave feeling prepared but aware of improvements needed** (realistic confidence)
5. **You identified students needing extra support** (intervention possible)

**This tutorial fails if:**

1. Students leave feeling MORE anxious without improvement plan
2. Feedback was too vague to be useful
3. Students didn't actually present (just talked about presenting)
4. No time for Q&A practice (critical skill)

---

## Tutor Self-Care

**This is an emotionally intensive tutorial:**
- Students are stressed about exams
- You're managing group dynamics, giving real-time coaching, enforcing time limits
- It's exhausting

**Take care of yourself:**
- Hydrate (bring water)
- If tutorial runs long, take 2-min break mid-way
- After tutorial, decompress (don't immediately jump to next task)
- Remember: You're facilitating THEIR success, not responsible for perfection

---

## Final Tutor Thoughts

**This tutorial is the culmination of 12 weeks of work.**

Students are presenting the synthesis of:
- Self-assessments (Week 5)
- Reflective practice (Week 3)
- Mentorship experiences (Weeks 2-11)
- Skills development (Weeks 1-12)
- Strategic planning (Week 11)
- Integration frameworks (Week 12)

**Your role:** Create the space for them to practice, get feedback, and improve before the high-stakes exam.

**Balance:**
- Rigor (honest feedback, time limits, rubric adherence)
- Support (encouragement, coaching, safety)

**They're nervous. That's okay. Nerves mean they care.**

Help them channel anxiety into preparation. Remind them: They've done the work. They have valuable stories to tell. They are ready.

**You've guided them for 12 weeks. Today, you're giving them the final tools to showcase their growth.**

**Thank you for your dedication to their development.**
