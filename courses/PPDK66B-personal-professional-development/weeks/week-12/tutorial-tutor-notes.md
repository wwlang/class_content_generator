## Session Timeline & Facilitation Guide

### Part 1: Presentation Structure Workshop (30 min)

#### Activity 1.1: The 5-Slide Core Framework (10 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"Your oral exam needs a clear narrative. Think of it like telling your professional development story. Every story has key elements: where you started, what you discovered, where you're going, and why it matters. Let's break this down."

**Instructions:**
1. Display the 5 components on screen (Who I Was, Who I Am, Where I'm Going, Why It Matters, How I'll Get There)
2. Give students 5 minutes to identify 1-2 key points from their PDP for each component
3. Pair students (ideally with someone they haven't worked with much—cross-pollinate ideas)
4. 5-minute pair-share: "Explain your journey using these 5 components in 2 minutes"

**Tutor Circulates:** Listen for students who are:
- Over-explaining (too much detail)
- Under-explaining (too vague)
- Not connecting components logically

**Common Issues:**
- **"I don't know what to include"**: Prompt: "What's the ONE most important insight from each section?"
- **"It doesn't flow"**: Suggest: "Try using transition phrases: 'This self-awareness led me to...', 'Because of this, my goals focus on...'"

**Whole-Class Debrief (2 min):**
Ask 1-2 students: "What did you realize about your presentation structure?"

---

#### Activity 1.2: Opening Strong & Closing Strong (10 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"First impressions and last impressions matter enormously. Your opening should grab attention and establish your theme. Your closing should leave examiners remembering you."

**Demonstration (3 min):**
- Read the WEAK opening example dramatically (monotone, generic)
- Then read the STRONG opening with energy and authenticity
- Ask: "What's the difference?" (Engagement, specificity, personal transformation)

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Your opening isn't about facts—it's about framing your journey. Your closing isn't just 'thank you'—it's a commitment statement."

**Individual Drafting (5 min):**
Students write their opening hook and closing commitment.

**Pair Practice (5 min):**
Partners deliver to each other. Listener assesses:
- Did it grab my attention?
- Did it feel authentic or rehearsed?
- Did the closing make me believe they'll follow through?

**Tutor Intervention:**
If pairs are struggling, offer sentence starters:
- Opening: "I used to believe [old assumption], but this course taught me [new insight]. My plan reflects..."
- Closing: "I'm committed to [specific action] starting [timeframe]. This isn't just a plan—it's my roadmap."

---

#### Activity 1.3: Timing Discipline (10 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"The exam is 10 minutes. Not 8. Not 12. Going significantly over or under signals poor time management—which is ironic given we taught time management in Week 8!"

**Teaching the Time Budget:**
Display on screen:
- Introduction + Who I Was: 2 min
- Who I Am + Vision: 2 min
- Goals & Roadmap: 3 min
- Course Integration: 2 min
- Implementation: 1 min

**Practice Task (10 min):**
Students practice their 5 core messages from Activity 1.1 in 8 minutes (leaving 2-min buffer).

**Tutor Role:**
- Set timer for 8 minutes and call time
- Circulate and observe: Who's rushing? Who's over-explaining?
- After 8 min, ask: "Raise your hand if you finished early (<7 min)?" "Who went over (>9 min)?"

**Coaching Guidance:**
- **Too short**: "Add a specific example or two. Instead of 'I want to improve public speaking,' say 'I want to present at 3 NEU conferences by July 2026 because...'"
- **Too long**: "Cut redundant points. You don't need to explain every single goal—focus on the most important 3-4."

### Part 2: Q&A Preparation & Strategy (30 min)

#### Activity 2.1: Anticipating Questions (10 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"Q&A isn't random. Examiners ask questions to assess four things: depth, authenticity, strategic thinking, and course integration. The best way to prepare is to anticipate what they'll ask."

**Instructions:**
1. Display the 5 common question types on screen
2. Give students 10 minutes to write:
   - 3 questions they hope examiners WON'T ask (challenging)
   - 2 questions they hope examiners WILL ask (confident answers)

**Why This Works:**
Students who identify their own weak spots will prepare better. The "challenging" questions reveal where they need to think deeper.

**Tutor Circulates:**
Look at students' "challenging questions." Common patterns:
- "What if this career path doesn't work out?" (needs backup plan thinking)
- "How do you know this aligns with your strengths?" (needs stronger evidence)
- "Why this specific goal?" (needs deeper motivation articulation)

**Optional Extension:**
If time, have students swap "challenging questions" with a partner and practice answering.

---

#### Activity 2.2: The STAR Response Framework (10 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"When examiners ask for examples or evidence, use STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Result. This keeps answers structured and convincing."

**Demonstration (5 min):**
- Read the WEAK example aloud (vague, no evidence)
- Then read the STAR example
- Ask: "Which answer would you find more credible as an examiner?"

**Teaching Point:**
"Your PDP claims you have certain strengths and values. STAR helps you PROVE it with real examples from your life."

**Pair Practice (5 min):**
- Partner 1 asks Partner 2 one of their "challenging questions"
- Partner 2 answers using STAR
- Switch roles

**Tutor Intervention:**
If students struggle to think of examples on the spot, prompt:
- "Think about a time in a group project, internship, or mentorship meeting when you demonstrated this."
- "It doesn't have to be dramatic—everyday examples work if they're specific."

---

#### Activity 2.3: Handling Difficult Questions Gracefully (10 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"You won't have perfect answers to every question. That's normal. What matters is how you handle uncertainty with professionalism."

**Teach the "Grace Under Pressure" Strategies:**
1. **Honest uncertainty**: "I haven't fully thought through [aspect], but my initial thinking is..."
2. **Acknowledge + reframe**: "That's a valid concern. Here's how I'm approaching it..."
3. **Pause to think**: "Let me think about that for a moment..." (3-second pause is fine)

**What to AVOID:**
- Defensiveness: "Well, I think my plan is good because..." (sounds insecure)
- Bluffing: Making up answers you're not sure about
- Deflecting: "I don't know" without attempting a thoughtful response

**Group Practice (10 min):**
Tutor poses 3-4 challenging questions. Ask for volunteers to answer in front of class.

**Example Questions to Pose:**
1. "Your PDP says you want to work in [industry]. What if AI automates most jobs in that field by 2030?"
2. "You've identified [strength] as core to your career. How do you know that's really a strength and not just something you enjoy?"
3. "Your mentor gave you feedback on [topic]. Did you agree with it? Why or why not?"
4. "If you could only achieve ONE of your 1-year goals, which would it be and why?"

**Debrief After Each Response:**
"What did [student name] do well in that answer?" (Acknowledge grace, honesty, strategic thinking)

---

### Part 3: Peer Practice & Feedback (25 min)

#### Activity 3.1: 5-Minute Lightning Presentations (15 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"Now you'll practice presenting in small groups. This is low-stakes practice—make mistakes here so you don't make them in the exam."

**Setup (2 min):**
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Each student presents 5-minute condensed version
- Timekeepers enforce timing (important!)
- Others complete feedback form

**Group Formation Strategy:**
Mix high-performers with those who need more support. Avoid letting friendship groups dominate.

**Tutor Circulates (15 min total):**
Visit each group briefly. Listen for:
- Content issues (vague goals, weak rationale, no course integration)
- Delivery issues (reading slides, poor eye contact, monotone voice, excessive "um")
- Timing issues (rushing, going way over)

**Intervention Examples:**
- To student reading slides: "Try looking at your group while talking. Slides are just prompts."
- To student who's too vague: "You said 'develop leadership skills.' Can you give a specific example of how?"
- To student who went over time: "You have great content but need to prioritize. What are the 3 MOST important points?"

**Feedback Form Reminder:**
Encourage specific, actionable feedback:
- NOT: "Good job!"
- INSTEAD: "Your passion for marketing was clear, but slow down when explaining your 3-year goals—I lost track."

---

#### Activity 3.2: One Improvement Commitment (10 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"Feedback is useless if you don't act on it. Based on what you just heard, commit to ONE specific improvement."

**Individual Task (5 min):**
Students write their improvement commitment. Walk around and read them—ensure they're specific.

**Common Weak Commitments (redirect these):**
- "Be better" → "Practice maintaining eye contact by presenting to mirror"
- "Improve slides" → "Reduce text on slides 4-6 by 50% and add one visual"
- "Sound more confident" → "Record myself 3 times and eliminate 'um' filler words"

**Partner Accountability (5 min):**
Students exchange contact info with one classmate. They'll check in 2 days before exam: "Did you work on your improvement area?"

**Why This Works:**
Social accountability increases follow-through. Students who know someone will ask are more likely to practice.

---

### Part 4: Final Exam Logistics & Mindset (5 min)

**Tutor Script:**
"Let's talk logistics and mindset. The logistics are straightforward; the mindset is what matters most."

**Review Exam Day Checklist (on screen):**
Go through each item briefly. Emphasize:
- **24 hours before**: Submit slides as backup (tech issues happen)
- **Exam day**: Arrive early, bring USB backup, breathe deeply
- **During presentation**: Eye contact, speak TO examiners not AT slides
- **During Q&A**: It's okay to pause and think—shows thoughtfulness

**Mindset Reset (3 min):**
Read the 5 mindset points aloud with emphasis:

1. "You are the EXPERT on your development plan. No one knows it better."
2. "We want AUTHENTICITY, not perfection. Be yourself."
3. "This is a CELEBRATION of your growth. You've accomplished a lot this semester."
4. "Nervousness is normal. Channel it into enthusiasm."
5. "You've prepared. Trust your preparation."

**Final Reflection (2 min):**
Ask: "What are you most proud of from your development journey this semester?"

Take 2-3 volunteers. This helps students reconnect with their achievements and ends tutorial on a positive, inspiring note.

## Common Student Questions & How to Answer

**Q: "What if I forget what to say during the exam?"**
A: "That's why you practice 5+ times. Your body will remember even if your brain blanks momentarily. Also, slides are your prompts—glance if you need to reorient."

**Q: "Can I bring notes?"**
A: "No. This exam assesses your ability to own and articulate your plan without reading. Notes create a crutch that undermines authenticity."

**Q: "What if examiners ask a question I genuinely don't know how to answer?"**
A: "Be honest: 'I haven't fully considered that, but here's my initial thinking...' Intellectual honesty is valued."

**Q: "How much detail should I go into about my self-assessments?"**
A: "Don't recite all results—synthesize. Example: 'My MBTI and VIA assessments both highlighted my preference for structured, analytical work, which is why I'm pursuing finance.'"

**Q: "Will you ask hard questions to trip us up?"**
A: "We ask questions to understand your thinking depth, not to trick you. If you've genuinely engaged with your plan, you'll be fine."

## Tutor Mindset & Role

**Your role today is COACH, not evaluator.**

Students are nervous about the exam. Your job is to:
1. Build their confidence through structured practice
2. Provide specific, actionable feedback
3. Normalize nervousness ("Even I get nervous presenting!")
4. Remind them of their growth and capability

**Avoid:**
- Being overly critical (save that for actual exam)
- Letting students avoid practice ("I'll do it later")
- Allowing vague feedback in peer practice ("It was good" isn't helpful)

**Encourage:**
- Vulnerability in practice (mistakes now prevent mistakes later)
- Specificity in feedback (what exactly to improve)
- Celebration of progress ("Look how much clearer your vision is than Week 1!")

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

**Immediately After:**
- Note which students seemed underprepared or particularly anxious
- Consider offering 1-on-1 office hours for students who need extra coaching
- Send class reminder email about exam logistics and submission deadline for slides

**Email Template (send within 24 hours):**

Subject: Week 12 Tutorial Recap + Final Oral Exam Reminders

Hi everyone,

Great work in today's tutorial! I saw significant improvement in clarity and confidence as you practiced presenting your PDPs.

**Reminders before the exam:**
1. Practice your full presentation 5+ times with a timer
2. Submit slides 24 hours before your exam time (backup)
3. Review the rubric in the Assessment Handbook—know what's assessed
4. Work on your "one improvement commitment" from peer feedback
5. Get good sleep the night before

**You've got this.** You've completed the hard work of self-discovery and planning. Now just show us who you've become.

Looking forward to seeing your presentations!

## Success Metrics for This Tutorial

Students leaving tutorial should be able to:
- [ ] Structure a 10-minute presentation with clear narrative arc
- [ ] Articulate specific, authentic reasons for their career goals
- [ ] Respond to Q&A questions using STAR framework
- [ ] Identify one concrete improvement to make before exam
- [ ] Feel more confident (not fully confident—some nervousness is good) about oral exam

**If students leave feeling:**
- **Overwhelmed**: You may have covered too much too fast. Simplify to core messages.
- **Unprepared**: Remind them this was PRACTICE. The real preparation happens in their 5+ rehearsals at home.
- **Confident but not cocky**: Perfect. This is the goal.

## Final Thoughts for Tutors

This tutorial is the last structured support before students present. Your encouragement and specific coaching matter enormously.

Some students will nail it immediately. Others will struggle. Both are normal.

What matters is that every student leaves with:
1. A clear structure for their presentation
2. Strategies for handling Q&A
3. Specific feedback on what to improve
4. Belief that they CAN do this

**You're not just preparing them for an exam—you're preparing them to confidently articulate their professional vision for the rest of their careers.**

That's powerful work. Thank you for facilitating it with care and expertise.
