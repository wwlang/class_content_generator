## Detailed Timing & Facilitation Guide

### Part 1: Quick Review & Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- 0:00-0:02 → Welcome and session overview
- 0:02-0:05 → Oral exam expectations recap

**Tutor Talking Points:**

**Welcome (2 minutes):**
"Welcome to our final tutorial—Week 12's oral exam preparation workshop. Show of hands: How many of you feel completely confident about your oral exam presentation?" [Expect few hands] "That's normal. Today's goal is to transform anxiety into confidence through practice and feedback. By the end of this 90 minutes, you'll have presented, received feedback multiple times, and practiced handling tough Q&A questions. You'll leave knowing exactly what to improve."

**Set the tone:** "This is a safe space to make mistakes. I'd rather you discover that your presentation runs too long HERE, where you can fix it, than during your actual exam where you'll be cut off. Feedback today is a gift—welcome it, don't defend against it."

**Oral Exam Recap (3 minutes):**

Quickly review on board or slides:
- **Format:** 15 min total (10 min presentation + 5 min Q&A)
- **Weight:** 30% of course grade
- **Assessment dimensions:**
  - Integration of course learning (35%) → naming frameworks, showing synthesis
  - Self-knowledge depth (35%) → insight beyond surface facts
  - Professional communication (30%) → visual design, delivery, Q&A capability

Highlight **common pitfalls** to avoid:
1. Running over time (emphasize: we WILL stop you at 10 minutes)
2. Reading slides verbatim
3. Listing facts without insight ("My MBTI is X" vs. "Discovering X revealed Y")
4. Vague goals without SMART criteria
5. Ignoring course frameworks entirely
6. Appearing unprepared or uncommitted

**Transition:** "Now let's practice. We're dividing into small groups for intensive feedback rotations."

---

### Part 2: Main Activity - Practice Presentation Rotations (60 minutes total)

**Setup & Group Formation (5 minutes):**

- Divide class into groups of 3-4 students (adjust based on class size)
- Ideal group size: 3 students (allows 3 rotations of 20 min each = 60 min)
- If class is 24 students → 8 groups of 3
- Assign groups to different areas of room to minimize cross-talk

**Hand out printed feedback forms** (one per student per rotation—each student needs 3 forms if 3 rotations)

**Instructions to class:**
"You'll complete three 20-minute rotations. In each rotation, one person presents for 5 minutes, then receives 3 minutes of peer feedback using these forms, then 2 minutes of my feedback. We'll rotate so everyone presents once per round. I'll circulate among groups to observe and provide targeted coaching."

"Important: You're NOT presenting your full 10-minute exam—just 5-minute excerpts of specific sections. Round 1 focuses on Self-Discovery Journey, Round 2 on Strategic Goals, Round 3 on Full Integration."

**Timer discipline:** Use visible timer (phone app, website timer projected, or verbal time calls). Announce: "Start presenting... 3 minutes remaining... 1 minute remaining... TIME." Be strict—this teaches time management.

---

#### Round 1: Self-Discovery Journey Practice (20 minutes)

**0:05-0:25 total**

**Tutor Role - Circulate and Coach:**

Visit each group during their presentations. Listen for 2-3 minutes, then provide brief targeted feedback. Focus on:

**Content Depth:**
- Are they sharing INSIGHTS or just FACTS?
- Example of weak: "My MBTI is INTJ, my VIA strength is Curiosity."
- Example of strong: "Discovering I'm INTJ surprised me because I thought introverts couldn't lead, but learning about my Te (Extraverted Thinking) preference showed I can make decisive, logical decisions even as an introvert. This changed my confidence about pursuing management roles."

**Coach students to:**
- Add "what surprised me" or "what this revealed" after each assessment mention
- Connect assessments: "Both my Holland Code (Investigative) and CliftonStrengths (Analytical) point to research-oriented work"
- Share emotional reactions: "I initially felt overwhelmed by my results until I saw the patterns"

**Time Management:**
- If student goes over 5 minutes, stop them: "That's time. How did that feel? What would you cut to fit 5 minutes?" This is valuable learning.

**Visual Use:**
- If students have slides, check: Are visuals supportive or text-heavy? Coach toward graphics (e.g., radar chart of VIA strengths, not bullet list).

**Common Issues to Watch For:**
- **Listing without synthesis:** "I did MBTI, then VIA, then CliftonStrengths..." (serial list, no integration)
  - **Coach:** "What PATTERN emerged across all five? Lead with that synthesis."
- **Surface-level description:** Just naming types without explaining implications
  - **Coach:** "Why does being ISTJ matter for your career choice? Connect assessment to career."
- **Over-explaining assessments:** Spending 2 minutes explaining what MBTI is
  - **Coach:** "We already know what MBTI is—just share YOUR results and insights."

**Feedback Quality Coaching:**

When you observe peer feedback sessions, coach students to give:
- **SPECIFIC praise:** Not "good job," but "Your connection between VIA Curiosity and your love of research projects was compelling"
- **ACTIONABLE improvements:** Not "be more confident," but "Try making more eye contact and slowing your pace by 20%"

---

#### Round 2: Strategic Goals & Roadmap Practice (20 minutes)

**0:25-0:45 total**

**Tutor Role - Circulate and Coach:**

Focus feedback on **SMART goal quality** and **strategic coherence**.

**SMART Goal Coaching:**

Listen for vague vs. specific goals:
- **Vague (unacceptable):** "I want to improve my skills and get a good job"
- **SMART (acceptable):** "By June 2026, I will complete Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate with 90%+ scores and secure a summer analytics internship at a Vietnamese tech company (VNG, FPT, or similar)"

**Coach students to add:**
- **Specific:** Exactly what will you do?
- **Measurable:** How will you know you succeeded?
- **Time-bound:** By when?

If goals are vague, stop them: "That goal isn't SMART yet. How would I objectively know in one year whether you achieved it? Add specifics."

**Strategic Coherence Coaching:**

Check whether 1-year → 3-year → 5-year goals logically build:
- Good coherence: "1-year: Learn Python and SQL → 3-year: Get junior analyst role → 5-year: Senior analyst leading projects" (clear progression)
- Poor coherence: "1-year: Learn Python → 3-year: Become marketing manager → 5-year: Start a restaurant" (disconnected jumps)

**Coach:** "Walk me through how your 1-year goals set up your 3-year goals. I'm not seeing the connection."

**Visual Coaching:**

Encourage timeline visuals:
- "Instead of listing goals as bullets, create a visual roadmap showing progression over 5 years with milestones"
- "Use a Gantt chart, timeline graphic, or stepped pyramid showing building blocks"

**Common Issues:**
- **Too many goals:** Listing 15 goals across all time horizons (overwhelming, unfocused)
  - **Coach:** "Narrow to your top 2-3 per time horizon—what's MOST important?"
- **Goals without action steps:** Stating goal but no strategy
  - **Coach:** "How will you achieve that? Mention 1-2 key action steps."
- **Unrealistic ambition or underambition:**
  - Over-ambitious: "1-year goal: Become VP of Marketing" (for second-year student with no experience)
  - Under-ambitious: "5-year goal: Maybe have a job somewhere" (lacks vision)
  - **Coach:** "Does this feel challenging but achievable? Adjust up or down."

---

#### Round 3: Full Integration Practice (20 minutes)

**0:45-1:05 total**

**Tutor Role - Holistic Feedback:**

This round simulates a condensed full presentation (5 min instead of 10 min). Focus on:

**Narrative Flow:**
- Do sections connect smoothly? Or does it feel like disjointed parts?
- Are transitions clear? ("Now that you understand my self-discovery, let me share how that informs my goals...")

**Course Framework Integration:**
- Did they mention specific concepts? (Gibbs' Cycle, growth mindset, SDT, creative tension, SMART goals, Ikigai, etc.)
- Did it feel natural or forced? ("I'm now going to mention Carol Dweck because I need to" = forced)

**Coach:** "You mentioned growth mindset briefly. Can you give one concrete example of how it changed your behavior this semester? That makes it real."

**Opening Hook:**
- Was it compelling? Did it make you want to hear more?
- Weak opening: "Hi, my name is X, and today I'll present my development plan"
- Strong opening: "Hi, I'm X, and by 2030 I'll be leading data-driven transformation at Vietnamese enterprises—let me show you how I'll get there"

**Closing Commitment:**
- Did they end confidently? Or did it fizzle out?
- Weak closing: "So yeah, that's my plan, thank you"
- Strong closing: "I'm excited about this journey. I know obstacles will arise, but I have the tools, mindset, and strategic plan to navigate them. This isn't just an assignment—it's my roadmap. Thank you."

**Authenticity Assessment:**
- Do you BELIEVE they own this plan? Or does it feel like they're saying what they think you want to hear?
- This is intuitive—trust your gut. If something feels rehearsed or inauthentic, note it.

**Coach toward authenticity:**
- "I'm noticing your energy drops when you talk about [X goal]. Are you genuinely excited about that, or is it something you think you should want?"
- "Your passion came through when discussing [Y]. Can you bring that energy to other sections?"

---

### Part 3: Q&A Practice & Preparation (15 minutes)

**1:05-1:20 total**

**Hot Seat Format:**

This is high-energy and slightly stressful (by design—simulating exam conditions).

**Setup (2 minutes):**
"Now we're practicing Q&A. I need 3-4 brave volunteers for the 'hot seat.' You'll face 3-4 rapid-fire questions about your plan—30-60 seconds to respond to each. This will feel uncomfortable, but it's excellent practice for thinking on your feet."

Select volunteers (ideally students who seem confident or who need Q&A practice). If no volunteers, gently nominate students you know can handle it.

**Hot Seat Process (12 minutes total = 3 min per volunteer):**

Student sits at front of room (or stands). Rapid-fire 4 questions:
1. Ask question
2. Student responds (30-60 sec)
3. Brief feedback from you (15-20 sec) on response quality
4. Next question

**After each volunteer's hot seat (30 sec):**
- Ask volunteer: "How did that feel? What was hardest?"
- Ask class: "What made their responses strong or weak?"

**Sample Questions by Type:**

Use variety across volunteers:

**Type 1 - Challenge to Goals:**
- "Your 5-year goal assumes [X]. What if that changes dramatically? How will you adapt?"
- "These goals are ambitious for someone without [specific experience]. Why should we believe you'll achieve them?"

**Type 2 - Self-Knowledge Depth:**
- "You said your MBTI is [X] and your strength is [Y]. How do those connect? Give me a real example."
- "Your Holland Code is [ABC] but your career choice is [field D]. Explain that mismatch."

**Type 3 - Course Integration:**
- "You mentioned Senge's creative tension. What does that concept mean and how are you applying it?"
- "Explain growth mindset in your own words and tell me how it changed your behavior this semester."

**Type 4 - Addressing Weaknesses:**
- "You listed [weakness X] in your SWOT. That seems like a major obstacle for your career choice. How will you overcome it?"
- "Your skills gap analysis shows you lack [technical skill Y]. Why haven't you addressed that yet?"

**Type 5 - Evidence-Based:**
- "You claim [strength X] is a signature strength. Describe a specific time you demonstrated it."
- "You said mentorship influenced your plan. Give me one concrete example of advice you implemented."

**Feedback on Responses - What to Praise:**
- Acknowledging question validity before answering
- Providing specific examples, not vague generalities
- Showing adaptive thinking, not rigid defensiveness
- Admitting uncertainty when appropriate: "That's a great question I hadn't fully considered. My initial thought is..."
- Confident, clear delivery without filler words (um, like, you know)

**Feedback on Responses - What to Coach:**
- Defensive reactions: "That's not a problem" → Coach: "Try 'You're right, that's a challenge, and here's how I'm addressing it'"
- Vague answers: "I'll try to improve" → Coach: "Give concrete strategy: 'I've enrolled in X course, scheduled Y meetings'"
- Rambling: Going over 60 seconds → Coach: "Aim for 30-45 sec responses—clear, concise, then stop"
- Frozen uncertainty: "Um... I don't know..." → Coach: "It's OK to think briefly. Try: 'Let me think... My approach would be...' Shows thoughtfulness."

**Class Debrief (1 minute):**
"What did we learn from hot seat practice?"
- Normalize nervousness: "Everyone felt anxious—that's normal. Preparation helps."
- Anticipate questions: "Review your plan and predict likely questions. Prepare bullet-point responses."
- Practice helps: "The more you practice Q&A, the less scary it becomes."

### Part 4: Before Next Class (10 minutes)

**1:20-1:30**

**Checklist Review (5 minutes):**

Project or reference the checklist from tutorial content:
- ☐ Complete presentation (deadline: 3 days before exam)
- ☐ Practice extensively (minimum 5 full run-throughs)
- ☐ Prepare for Q&A (anticipate 5-8 likely questions)
- ☐ Logistics preparation (tech check, backup plan, clothing)
- ☐ Mental preparation (review course learning, adequate sleep)

**Emphasize:**
- "Practice minimum 5 times. NOT optional. Each practice improves delivery, timing, and confidence."
- "Record yourself once—it's painful to watch but incredibly valuable for identifying verbal tics and pacing issues."
- "Practice with someone who will ask tough questions—mentor, family member, peer. Friendly audiences don't prepare you for critical Q&A."

**Reflection Questions (3 minutes):**

"Take 3 minutes to journal right now." Provide prompts:
1. What did you learn from today's practice?
2. What's your biggest concern about the exam?
3. What's your specific strategy for addressing that concern?
4. What are you most excited to share?

Walk around room while students write—this signals importance and gives thinking time.

**Final Encouragement (2 minutes):**

"You've completed 12 weeks of intensive personal development work. You've done five major assessments. You've learned evidence-based frameworks. You've created strategic development plans. You have substantive content to present—this isn't fluff.

The oral exam is your opportunity to demonstrate and celebrate that work. Yes, it's assessed, so preparation matters. But it's also a milestone—a chance to articulate your vision and commit publicly to your development journey. That's powerful.

Three reminders: First, authentic confidence—not arrogance, not false modesty—is your goal. 'I know my strengths, acknowledge my developmental areas, have a strategic plan, and I'm committed to growth.' Second, feedback today was a gift allowing improvement before high-stakes exam. Implement it. Third, you've got this. The fact that you engaged in this tutorial demonstrates the intentionality and ownership that predicts success.

I look forward to your presentations. You're becoming remarkable professionals."

## Facilitation Tips

### Managing Group Dynamics

**If Groups Finish Early:**
- Encourage additional rounds of feedback
- Have students practice specific challenging sections again
- Invite students to practice Q&A with each other using sample questions from tutorial content

**If Groups Are Running Behind:**
- Signal time clearly: "We need to move to next rotation in 2 minutes—finish current feedback"
- It's OK if not everyone gets exactly equal time—prioritize quality feedback over perfect equity

**If Students Are Giving Weak Feedback:**
- Intervene: "Let me model strong feedback. [Student], one specific strength was [X]—that worked because [Y]. One concrete improvement: instead of [A], try [B] because [reason]."
- Coach: "Avoid vague praise like 'good job.' What SPECIFICALLY was effective?"

### Handling Student Anxiety

**Nervous Students:**
- Normalize: "Nervousness is normal—it means you care. Channel that energy into preparation."
- Provide structure: "You're not winging this. You have a checklist, practice plan, and clear expectations."
- Celebrate small wins: "You got through that 5-minute practice—that's progress. Keep building."

**Overly Confident Students (Underestimating Preparation Needed):**
- Reality check: "Confidence is good, but this is 30% of your grade. Have you timed yourself yet?"
- Challenge: "Practice your Q&A response to this question: [ask tough question]. How did that feel?"
- Emphasize: "The students who practice least tend to run over time or freeze during Q&A. Don't let that be you."

### Cultural Considerations for Vietnamese Students

**Modesty vs. Self-Promotion:**
- Vietnamese cultural norms often emphasize humility. Students may struggle with "selling" themselves in presentations.
- **Coach:** "This isn't bragging—it's professional communication of your capabilities. In global business contexts, you must articulate your strengths clearly. Practice that skill here."

**Collectivism vs. Individual Achievement:**
- Students may feel uncomfortable focusing entirely on individual goals and achievements.
- **Coach:** "Notice that your goals likely benefit others—your family, your future team, society. Frame your vision as contribution, not just personal success."

**Respect for Authority:**
- Students may hesitate to challenge or disagree during Q&A, even when question format invites pushback.
- **Coach:** "In Q&A, thoughtful disagreement is acceptable: 'That's a fair concern. My perspective is [X] because [Y].' You're demonstrating critical thinking, not disrespect."

**Presentation Style:**
- Vietnamese students may be more comfortable with formal, scripted presentations than spontaneous delivery.
- **Coach:** "Practice until content is internalized, then present conversationally. Reading a script appears unprepared in international business contexts."

## Valid Approaches (Multiple Paths to Excellence)

Students can excel with different presentation styles and structures. **Do NOT enforce a single "correct" approach.** Valid variations include:

### Structure Variations

**Standard Structure (Recommended):**
Hook → Self-Discovery → Vision/Values → Goals/Roadmap → Course Integration → Closing

**Alternative Valid Structure:**
Vision-First: Start with compelling 5-year vision → Work backward showing how self-discovery informed that vision → Present goals as milestones toward vision → Integrate frameworks throughout

**Narrative Structure:**
Tell chronological story: "When I started this course, I was uncertain about [X]. Week 5's assessments revealed [Y]. My mentorship taught me [Z]. Now I have clarity: [vision]. Here's my roadmap..."

**All are acceptable if executed well.**

### Presentation Style Variations

**Analytical Style:**
- Heavy on data and frameworks
- Emphasizes logical coherence and evidence
- Less emotional, more systematic
- **Valid for students with INTJ/ISTJ profiles or analytical strengths**

**Narrative Style:**
- Story-driven with personal anecdotes
- Emphasizes emotional journey and transformation
- More expressive delivery
- **Valid for students with strong Communication strengths or expressive personalities**

**Balanced Style:**
- Mix of frameworks and stories
- Moderate emotional expression
- **Valid for most students**

**As tutor, adapt feedback to student's natural style.** Don't force analytical students to be emotionally expressive, or narrative students to be data-heavy. Coach them to excellence within their style.

### Visual Design Variations

**Minimalist Design:**
- Very few words per slide
- Large images or single graphics
- Verbal narration carries content
- **Valid—often most professional**

**Structured Design:**
- Clear headings and bullet points (concise, not dense)
- Charts and diagrams
- Text supports verbal narration
- **Valid—provides clarity**

**Both acceptable. Avoid only:**
- Dense paragraph slides (unreadable)
- Cheesy clip art or decorative elements that don't add meaning
- Inconsistent fonts, colors, or themes (looks unprofessional)

## Assessment Alignment

This tutorial directly prepares students for **Final Oral Exam (Assessment 4 - 30% of course grade).**

**Rubric Criteria Addressed:**

| Rubric Criterion | How Tutorial Prepares |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **Integration of Course Learning (35%)** | Round 3 practice emphasizes framework integration; Q&A practice requires explaining concepts; tutor coaching pushes beyond superficial mentions |
| **Self-Knowledge Depth (35%)** | Round 1 practice focuses on moving from facts to insights; feedback forms assess depth; tutor coaching challenges surface-level descriptions |
| **Professional Communication (30%)** | All rounds practice delivery; peer feedback assesses visuals, clarity, timing; hot seat builds Q&A capability; checklist emphasizes design and practice |

**Tutorial Success = Exam Success:**
Students who fully engage in this tutorial (present, receive feedback, implement improvements, practice Q&A) will perform significantly better on actual exam.

**Students Who Skip Tutorial:**
Will likely struggle with time management, lack practice with challenging questions, and miss feedback identifying blind spots. Encourage attendance strongly.

---

## Contingency Planning

### If Tutorial Runs Short (Finishes Early)

**Additional Activities:**
- Extended hot seat Q&A with more volunteers
- Peer practice: Pair students to practice full 10-min presentations to each other
- Open Q&A: "What questions do you have about the exam or your presentation?"
- Individual coaching: Work one-on-one with students who need extra help

### If Tutorial Runs Long (Not Enough Time)

**Prioritization:**
1. **Must complete:** At least Round 1 practice (Self-Discovery)
2. **High priority:** Hot seat Q&A (builds critical Q&A skills)
3. **Can abbreviate:** Round 3 if needed
4. **Can skip if necessary:** Extended discussion/debrief (students have written feedback)

### Technical Issues

**If slides won't display:**
- Students practice verbally without slides—actually good practice for thinking on feet
- Focus feedback on content and delivery rather than visuals

**If room is too small/noisy:**
- Move groups to hallway or adjacent rooms if available
- Reduce group size (pairs instead of 3-4) to minimize noise

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

**After Session:**

**Email students within 24 hours:**
- Reminder about exam date/time/location
- Link to tutorial content with checklist
- Encouragement: "Great work in today's practice session. Implement the feedback you received and you'll excel."
- Office hours availability for students needing extra coaching

**For Students Who Struggled:**
- Reach out individually: "I noticed you're still working on [X]. Would you like to schedule a 15-minute coaching session?"
- Offer targeted help on specific weaknesses (time management, Q&A, structure, etc.)

**For Students Who Missed Tutorial:**
- Share tutorial content and feedback forms
- Strongly encourage practicing with peers
- Note that missing tutorial disadvantages them (gently, not punitively)

**Track Common Issues:**
- If many students struggle with same issue (e.g., time management), send class-wide tip
- Example: "Many of you ran over 5 minutes in practice. Remember: less is more. Cut content if needed to stay within time."

---

## Success Indicators

By end of tutorial, you should observe:

✓ Students presenting more confidently than at start of session
✓ Feedback forms completed thoughtfully (specific, actionable)
✓ Students actively implementing feedback between rotations ("I noticed you said X, so I tried Y in my next practice")
✓ Reduced anxiety ("I feel more prepared now")
✓ Specific improvement plans ("I'm going to practice time management 5 more times before exam")
✓ Students helping each other (peer coaching, sharing tips)

If these aren't happening, adjust facilitation:
- Model feedback more explicitly
- Provide more structure and examples
- Increase energy and encouragement
- Address anxiety directly

---

**This tutorial is their final preparation for a high-stakes assessment. Your coaching can significantly impact their performance. Be supportive, specific, and demanding—push for excellence while reducing anxiety through preparation.**
