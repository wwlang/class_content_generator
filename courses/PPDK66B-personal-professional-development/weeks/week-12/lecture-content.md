    <title>What Is Personal Mastery?</title>
    <content>
      <definition>
        <term>Personal Mastery</term>
        <meaning>The discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, focusing our energies, developing patience, and seeing reality objectively (Senge, 2006)</meaning>
      </definition>
      <point>Not a position or achievement—it's a PROCESS and DISCIPLINE</point>
      <point>People with high personal mastery:</point>
      <subpoint>See current reality clearly without defensiveness</subpoint>
      <subpoint>Hold a clear vision of what they want to create</subpoint>
      <subpoint>Use the gap between vision and reality as energy for growth</subpoint>
      <subpoint>Approach life as an artist approaches a work of art</subpoint>
      <callout type="key_concept">Personal mastery is about living life as a creative work, not just existing.</callout>
    </content>

    <title>Senge's Creative Tension Model</title>
    <content>
      <visual_description>Diagram showing two points connected by tension arrow: "PERSONAL VISION (Where you want to be)" at top and "CURRENT REALITY (Where you are now)" at bottom, with bidirectional arrow labeled "CREATIVE TENSION = ENERGY FOR GROWTH"</visual_description>
      <explanation>The gap between your vision and current reality generates creative tension—the fundamental driver of personal growth.</explanation>
      <point>The greater the clarity of vision + honesty about reality = greater creative energy</point>
      <point>Most people resolve tension by lowering their vision (settling)</point>
      <point>Masters use tension to pull themselves toward their vision</point>
      <callout type="warning">If you don't hold tension consciously, it will resolve unconsciously—usually by lowering your vision.</callout>

    <title>Two Commitments of Personal Mastery</title>
    <content>
      <section>
        <heading>1. Commitment to Personal Vision</heading>
        <point>Clarifying what truly matters to you (not what others expect)</point>
        <point>Your 50-word vision statement is the START, not the end</point>
        <point>Vision evolves as you grow—revisit quarterly</point>
      </section>
      <section>
        <heading>2. Commitment to Truth (Current Reality)</heading>
        <point>Seeing where you actually are without self-deception</point>
        <point>Your SWOT analysis and skills gap assessment are truth-telling tools</point>
        <point>Truth without vision breeds cynicism; vision without truth breeds delusion</point>

    <title>Personal Mastery: Systems Thinking Perspective</title>
    <content>
      <point>You are not isolated—you exist within interconnected systems:</point>
      <subpoint>Family system (values, expectations, support)</subpoint>
      <subpoint>Educational system (NEU, professors, peers)</subpoint>
      <subpoint>Economic system (Vietnam labor market, global economy)</subpoint>
      <subpoint>Technological system (AI transformation, digital tools)</subpoint>

    <title>The Science: Self-Determination Theory</title>

      <point>Pink's framework comes from Self-Determination Theory (Deci &amp; Ryan)</point>
      <point>Recent meta-analysis (Van den Broeck et al., 2021) of 124 studies reveals nuance:</point>
      <visual_description>Continuum showing six motivation types from left (AMOTIVATION) to right (INTRINSIC MOTIVATION): Amotivation → External Regulation → Introjected Regulation → Identified Regulation → Integrated Regulation → Intrinsic Motivation</visual_description>
      <point>KEY FINDING: "Identified regulation" (finding personal meaning in work) predicts job performance BETTER than pure intrinsic motivation</point>

    <title>Element 1: Focus on Growth</title>
    <content>
      <point>Embraces Dweck's growth mindset (Week 9): Abilities can be developed</point>
      <point>Shift from "I'm not good at this" → "I'm not good at this YET"</point>
      <point>Reframe setbacks as learning opportunities, not evidence of limits</point>
      <example>
        <scenario>You received tough mentor feedback on your PDP draft</scenario>
