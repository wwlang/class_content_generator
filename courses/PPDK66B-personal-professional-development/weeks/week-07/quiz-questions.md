    topic: "WEF Skills Disruption"
    framework: "WEF Future of Jobs 2025"

    question: |
      According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025, what percentage of core skills do employers expect to change by 2030?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "25%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The percentage is higher than 25%, reflecting more significant skills disruption anticipated over the next five years."

      - key: "B"
        text: "39%"
        feedback: "Correct! The WEF 2025 report found that employers expect 39% of core skills to change by 2030, reflecting the rapid pace of skills disruption in the modern workplace."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "50%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While skill disruption is significant, the WEF finding is 39%, not half of all core skills."

      - key: "D"
        text: "62%"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The WEF projects 39% skills disruption by 2030, which is substantial but not as high as 62%."

    general_feedback: |
      The WEF finding that 39% of core skills will change by 2030 emphasizes the importance of developing transferable capabilities and learning agility rather than relying solely on current technical skills. This level of disruption means focusing on meta-skills that enable continuous skill acquisition.

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Creative thinking"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Creative thinking ranks 4th in the WEF framework, but analytical thinking is the top priority at 70%."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Resilience and flexibility"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Resilience, flexibility, and agility rank 2nd, following analytical thinking as the top priority."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Analytical thinking"
        feedback: "Correct! The WEF 2025 report identifies analytical thinking as the top skill, with 70% of employers considering it essential."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "Leadership and social influence"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Leadership and social influence rank 3rd in the WEF framework, following analytical thinking at #1."

    general_feedback: |
      Analytical thinking's position at #1 reflects the growing importance of data-driven decision-making, problem-solving, and critical analysis across industries. Following analytical thinking, the top priorities are resilience/flexibility/agility (#2) and leadership/social influence (#3).

    topic: "NACE Framework"
    framework: "NACE Career Readiness Competencies"

    question: |
      How many career readiness competencies does the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) framework identify?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "5 competencies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The NACE framework is more comprehensive, identifying 8 career readiness competencies."

      - key: "B"
        text: "8 competencies"
        feedback: "Correct! The NACE Career Readiness framework (revised March/April 2024) identifies 8 employer-validated competencies."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "10 competencies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. NACE identifies 8 competencies, not 10. You may be confusing this with the WEF Top 10 skills list."

      - key: "D"
        text: "12 competencies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. NACE identifies 8 competencies. The number 12 refers to the ESCI emotional intelligence framework, not NACE."

    general_feedback: |
      The 8 NACE competencies are: Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, Leadership, Professionalism, Career & Self-Development, Technology, and Equity & Inclusion. These were developed collaboratively by career services professionals and HR/recruiting leaders.

    topic: "Goleman EI Model Structure"
    framework: "Goleman's EI Model"

    question: |
      How many domains does Daniel Goleman's emotional intelligence model contain?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "2 domains"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While Goleman's model has 2 dimensions (Self-Other and Awareness-Management), it contains 4 domains at the intersection of these dimensions."

      - key: "B"
        text: "4 domains"
        feedback: "Correct! Goleman's emotional intelligence model contains 4 domains: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "8 domains"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Goleman's model has 4 domains, not 8. You may be thinking of the 8 NACE competencies."

      - key: "D"
        text: "12 domains"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Goleman's model has 4 domains. The number 12 refers to how Boyatzis operationalized these 4 domains into 12 specific competencies in the ESCI."

    general_feedback: |
      Goleman's 4 EI domains are organized across two dimensions: Self-Awareness and Self-Management (focused on self), and Social Awareness and Relationship Management (focused on others). Richard Boyatzis later operationalized these 4 domains into 12 specific competencies in the ESCI (Emotional and Social Competency Inventory).

    topic: "Skills Evolution"
    framework: "Transferable Skills (Tushar & Sooraksa 2023)"

    question: |
      Tushar and Sooraksa's (2023) 30-year systematic review of employability research revealed a fundamental shift in employer priorities. Which statement best describes this shift?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "From soft skills to technical skills as technology became more important"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The shift is actually in the opposite direction—from specific technical skills toward broader capabilities. Technology's rise made adaptability more important, not technical proficiency."

      - key: "B"
        text: "From specific technical competencies to 'meta-skills' that enable continuous learning"
        feedback: "Correct! Tushar and Sooraksa identified a shift from valuing specific technical skills to prioritizing meta-skills that enable skill acquisition."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "From individual capabilities to team-based competencies exclusively"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While teamwork increased in importance, the fundamental shift was from specific technical skills to meta-skills (learning agility, adaptability). Both individual and team competencies remain valued."

      - key: "D"
        text: "From cognitive abilities to emotional intelligence as the sole priority"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The shift was from specific technical skills to meta-skills. Both cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence are important, but neither is the sole priority."

    general_feedback: |
      Tushar and Sooraksa's systematic review (analyzing 25 studies and 87 unique skills from 1990-2019) shows employers now value learning agility, adaptability, and curiosity more highly than proficiency in particular tools or methods. These meta-skills enable workers to acquire whatever specific skills future roles require.

    topic: "Framework Application"
    framework: "WEF vs. NACE"

    question: |
      A student is planning their professional development priorities for the next year. How should they best use the WEF and NACE frameworks together?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Use only WEF because it's more recent and globally recognized"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Using only one framework limits your perspective. WEF and NACE serve complementary purposes and should be used together."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Use only NACE because it provides more specific behavioral indicators"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While NACE provides useful behavioral detail, using only NACE misses WEF's global trends and future-focused insights."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Use WEF to identify emerging skill demands and NACE for current self-assessment with behavioral indicators"
        feedback: "Correct! WEF provides future trends while NACE provides actionable competency definitions—use both complementarily."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "Use them interchangeably since both frameworks identify identical competencies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The frameworks are not identical—they serve different purposes. WEF focuses on future trends; NACE provides current graduate readiness criteria."

    general_feedback: |
      WEF provides global perspective on skills disruption and future trends (what will matter by 2030), while NACE provides concrete competency definitions with behavioral indicators for current preparation. Use NACE for immediate self-assessment to identify gaps, then review WEF trends to prioritize capabilities that are both current gaps AND growing in importance.

    topic: "EI Domain Development Sequence"
    framework: "Goleman's EI Model"

    question: |
      A manager notices they often feel frustrated during team meetings but doesn't recognize this emotion until after the meeting ends, at which point they regret their impatient responses. According to Goleman's EI model, which domain should they develop FIRST to address this pattern?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Relationship Management, because the issue involves team interactions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While the issue manifests in team interactions, the root problem is lack of real-time emotional recognition, not relationship management skill."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Self-Management, because they need better emotional control"
        feedback: "Incorrect. You cannot manage emotions you don't recognize. Self-awareness must precede self-management."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Self-Awareness, because they aren't recognizing emotions as they occur"
        feedback: "Correct! The manager's primary issue is lack of real-time emotional recognition—a Self-Awareness deficit that must be addressed first."
        correct: true

      - key: "D"
        text: "Social Awareness, because they need to understand team dynamics better"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The issue is recognizing their own emotions (self-awareness), not understanding others' emotions (social awareness)."

    general_feedback: |
      Goleman's model establishes Self-Awareness as foundational: you cannot manage emotions you don't recognize. The development sequence typically proceeds from awareness to management and from self to other. This manager needs to develop capacity to recognize frustration AS IT OCCURS, which would then enable Self-Management (regulating the frustration) and improved Relationship Management.

    topic: "EI Measurement Methods"
    framework: "ESCI (Boyatzis 2018)"

    question: |
      The ESCI (Emotional and Social Competency Inventory) measures emotional intelligence differently than self-report personality measures like the EQ-i or TEIQue. What is the key methodological difference and why does it matter?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "ESCI uses 360-degree behavioral ratings; this reduces blind spots compared to self-report and predicts leadership performance more accurately"
        feedback: "Correct! The ESCI uses ratings from self and others (supervisor, peers, direct reports), reducing blind spots and predicting performance better."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "ESCI is shorter and faster to complete; this makes it more practical for workplace use"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The key difference is the 360-degree behavioral approach, not completion time. Self-report measures can also be brief."

      - key: "C"
        text: "ESCI measures only self-awareness; this provides more focused assessment than comprehensive measures"
        feedback: "Incorrect. ESCI measures all 4 EI domains through 12 competencies, not just self-awareness. The key difference is the 360-degree method."

      - key: "D"
        text: "ESCI uses ability testing like an IQ test; this provides objective measurement unlike subjective ratings"
        feedback: "Incorrect. ESCI uses behavioral ratings, not ability testing. You're thinking of MSCEIT, which uses ability-test methodology."

    general_feedback: |
      Boyatzis (2018) explains that ESCI uses 360-degree assessment: you rate yourself AND others rate you on observable behaviors. This reduces blind spots inherent in self-report (people low in empathy often rate themselves as empathetic). Research shows ESCI behavioral competencies predict leadership effectiveness and team performance more strongly than self-report trait measures.

    topic: "ESCI Competency Application"
    framework: "ESCI Competencies"

    question: |
      A team member notices their colleague seems withdrawn and stressed during a project. They approach the colleague privately, ask open-ended questions about what's wrong, listen attentively without judgment, and offer to help redistribute work if needed. Which ESCI competency is PRIMARILY demonstrated?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Emotional Self-Awareness (recognizing own emotions)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Emotional Self-Awareness involves recognizing your own emotions, not understanding others' emotions."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Empathy (understanding others' emotions and providing support)"
        feedback: "Correct! This scenario demonstrates Empathy: sensing others' feelings, understanding their perspective, listening attentively, and providing support."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Influence (persuading others effectively)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Influence involves persuading others toward goals. This scenario shows understanding and supporting someone, not influencing them."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Teamwork (building collaborative relationships)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While teamwork is relevant, the primary competency demonstrated is Empathy—understanding and responding to another person's emotional state."

    general_feedback: |
      This scenario primarily demonstrates Empathy, a Social Awareness competency. The behavioral indicators include: sensing others' feelings through nonverbal cues (noticing withdrawal), understanding their perspective (asking open-ended questions), listening attentively (without judgment), and providing practical support (offering help). While Teamwork is also relevant, Empathy is the PRIMARY competency because the focus is on emotional understanding and response.

    topic: "EI and Peak Performance"
    framework: "Goleman & Cherniss (2024)"

    question: |
      According to Goleman and Cherniss's (2024) research on optimal leadership, how does emotional intelligence enable "optimal states" or flow in teams?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "EI allows leaders to identify and eliminate team members who aren't performing optimally"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Goleman and Cherniss focus on creating conditions for success, not eliminating people. EI enables supportive environments, not punitive approaches."

      - key: "B"
        text: "EI enables leaders to create conditions for peak performance: clear goals, immediate feedback, psychological safety, and reading team energy"
        feedback: "Correct! Goleman and Cherniss show that EI-strong leaders create conditions that enable team flow through goals, feedback, safety, and awareness."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "EI helps leaders maintain constant high intensity and pressure that drives optimal performance"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Constant pressure undermines flow states. EI enables reading team energy and knowing when to push, support, or step back—not constant intensity."

      - key: "D"
        text: "EI allows leaders to delegate all relationship management to HR professionals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. EI involves personal relationship management by the leader, not delegation to HR. Leaders with high EI directly create supportive conditions."

    general_feedback: |
      Goleman and Cherniss (2024) connect emotional intelligence to optimal states by showing that EI-strong leaders CREATE CONDITIONS enabling team flow: setting clear goals (Self-Awareness), providing immediate feedback (Social Awareness), building psychological safety (Relationship Management), and reading team energy (Social Awareness). Their research shows organizations with EI-strong leaders demonstrate higher innovation and retention.

    topic: "CQ vs Cultural Knowledge"
    framework: "Cultural Intelligence (Gozzoli et al. 2018)"

    question: |
      Which scenario best illustrates HIGH cultural intelligence (CQ) as distinct from simply having cultural knowledge?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "A student has memorized business etiquette rules for Japan, Thailand, and Germany from a textbook"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This shows CQ-Knowledge of specific cultures but doesn't demonstrate the capability to learn and adapt across ANY culture."

      - key: "B"
        text: "A manager moving to a new country consciously observes communication patterns, adjusts their approach based on what works, and reflects afterward on cultural factors"
        feedback: "Correct! This demonstrates all four CQ factors: Drive (willingness), Knowledge (learning patterns), Strategy (conscious adjustment), and Action (behavioral flexibility)."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "An employee speaks three languages fluently and has studied anthropology"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Language skill and academic study show knowledge but not necessarily the capability to adapt effectively across cultures."

      - key: "D"
        text: "A business professional has lived in the same country their entire life and understands its culture deeply"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Deep knowledge of one culture shows culture-specific expertise, not the generalizable cross-cultural capability that defines CQ."

    general_feedback: |
      This scenario demonstrates HIGH cultural intelligence because it shows the CAPABILITY to learn and adapt across cultures, not just knowledge of specific cultures. The manager exhibits all four CQ factors: CQ-Drive (willingness to engage), CQ-Knowledge (learning patterns through observation), CQ-Strategy (conscious monitoring and adjustment), and CQ-Action (behavioral flexibility). CQ is the ability to learn and adapt to ANY culture, not expertise in particular cultures.

    topic: "Vietnam Employer Context"
    framework: "Vietnam Context (Tran et al. 2022)"

    question: |
      Tran et al.'s (2022) research on Vietnamese employer expectations found that they value globally-recognized competencies (like adaptability and continuous learning) but emphasize culturally-specific applications. Which statement best explains this finding?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Vietnamese employers reject international competency frameworks as culturally inappropriate"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Vietnamese employers value globally-recognized competencies; they don't reject international frameworks but emphasize local applications."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Vietnamese employers value the same competencies as global frameworks but emphasize practical application, self-directed learning, and community empathy reflecting local contexts"
        feedback: "Correct! Vietnamese employers value global competencies but emphasize culturally-specific applications reflecting local business realities and cultural values."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Vietnamese employers only value technical skills, not transferable competencies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Tran et al. found that Vietnamese employers strongly value transferable competencies, particularly continuous learning, resilience, and adaptability."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Vietnamese employers' expectations are completely different from international standards"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The competencies align globally; the difference is in HOW they're applied and WHY they matter in Vietnamese contexts."

    general_feedback: |
      Tran et al. (2022) found that Vietnamese employers DO value globally-recognized competencies from frameworks like WEF and NACE. However, they emphasize CULTURALLY-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS: self-directed learning (because formal training infrastructure differs from Western contexts), practical problem-solving (addressing gaps between academic knowledge and implementation), and empathy for local communities (reflecting collectivist cultural values). This isn't rejection of international frameworks—it's contextual adaptation.
