## Part 1: Quick Review (5 minutes)

### Framework Recap

**Facilitator leads brief review:**

Today we're conducting systematic self-assessment using three complementary frameworks:

1. **NACE Career Readiness Competencies (8 competencies)**
   - Focus: Employer-validated graduate employability capabilities
   - Use: Broad competency assessment across critical thinking, communication, teamwork, leadership, professionalism, career/self-development, technology, equity/inclusion

2. **ESCI Emotional Intelligence (12 competencies across 4 domains)**
   - Focus: Interpersonal and intrapersonal effectiveness
   - Use: Detailed behavioral assessment of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management

3. **Cultural Intelligence Scale (4 factors)**
   - Focus: Cross-cultural effectiveness
   - Use: Assessment of motivational, cognitive, metacognitive, and behavioral cultural capabilities

### Assessment Principles

**Key points facilitator should emphasize:**

- **Honest self-assessment is developmentally valuable.** This is not graded on your scores—it's graded on thoughtful completion. Low scores identify opportunities, not failures.

- **Use behavioral indicators, not aspirations.** Rate what you actually DO, not what you wish you did or think you should do. Concrete recent examples are your evidence.

- **External feedback would be more accurate.** Ideally, you'd use 360-degree assessment (ESCI model). For today, be aware of potential blind spots in self-rating.

- **Development requires prioritization.** You cannot develop all competencies simultaneously. Identify 2-3 high-impact priorities for focused effort this semester.

### Activity 2.4: Development Plan Creation (15 minutes)

**Individual work: 15 minutes**

#### Instructions

Synthesize your three assessments (NACE, ESCI, CQ) into a focused development plan:

1. **Identify 2-3 priority competencies** based on:
   - Gap between current capability and desired/required level
   - Importance for your specific career goals
   - Foundation for other competencies (e.g., self-awareness enables self-management)
   - Opportunities for practice available to you this semester

2. **For each priority competency, specify:**
   - **Current evidence:** What behaviors DO you demonstrate?
   - **Development gap:** What behaviors do you struggle with or demonstrate inconsistently?
   - **Development strategies:** 3-4 specific, actionable practices
   - **Practice opportunities:** Where/when you'll apply these strategies this semester
   - **Progress indicators:** How you'll know you're improving

## Part 3: Before Next Class (10 minutes)

### Peer Discussion (8 minutes)

**Facilitator organizes pairs for brief sharing:**

"Find a partner and share for 4 minutes each (8 minutes total):
- Which 2-3 competencies are you prioritizing for development?
- What development strategies will you try?
- What practice opportunities are you planning to use?
- What challenges do you anticipate?"

**Purpose:** Articulating plans to another person strengthens commitment and may generate additional ideas.

---

### Closing Reflection & Next Steps (2 minutes)

**Individual quick-write:**

Complete these sentences:
1. "The most surprising insight from today's assessment was..."
2. "The competency I'm most committed to developing is..."
3. "One concrete action I'll take this week is..."

**Facilitator closing:**

"Today's self-assessment is foundational for your professional development this semester and beyond. Three connections to remember:

**Assessment 3 (Self-Portrait Video):** Many of you will choose to highlight a transferable skill or EI competency as a strength to showcase, or explain a competency you're developing. Today's analysis provides evidence for these choices.

**Assessment 5 (Professional Portfolio):** Articulating your competencies clearly—with behavioral evidence—is essential for professional portfolios, resumes, and interviews. Practice translating self-awareness into employer-relevant language.

**Career Development:** These frameworks aren't just academic exercises. WEF, NACE, ESCI, and CQ represent how employers and HR professionals think about talent. Speaking this language enables more effective career navigation.

Next week we explore professional presence and communication—the visible manifestations of many competencies you assessed today. Come prepared to discuss how presence enables effectiveness.

Submit your completed self-assessment and development plan to Moodle by [deadline]. Bring your development plan to Week 8 tutorial—we'll reference it when practicing professional communication."
