## Activity 1: Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Self-rate on Boyatzis' 12 EI competencies using behavioral evidence

### Instructions for Students

**Step 1: Understanding the ESCI Framework (5 min)**

Review Boyatzis' 12 competencies organized by Goleman's 4 domains:

**Self-Awareness (1 competency):**
1. **Emotional Self-Awareness** — Recognizing your emotions and their effects

**Self-Management (4 competencies):**
2. **Achievement Orientation** — Striving to improve or meet excellence standards
3. **Adaptability** — Flexibility in handling change
4. **Emotional Self-Control** — Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check
5. **Positive Outlook** — Persistence in pursuing goals despite obstacles and setbacks

**Social Awareness (2 competencies):**
6. **Empathy** — Sensing others' feelings and perspectives, taking active interest
7. **Organizational Awareness** — Reading emotional currents and power relationships in groups

**Relationship Management (5 competencies):**
8. **Coach & Mentor** — Taking active interest in others' development needs
9. **Conflict Management** — Negotiating and resolving disagreements
10. **Influence** — Having positive impact on others through persuasion
11. **Inspirational Leadership** — Inspiring and guiding individuals and groups
12. **Teamwork & Collaboration** — Working cooperatively with others toward shared goals

**Step 2: Self-Rating with Behavioral Evidence (10 min)**

For each competency, rate yourself on 1-5 scale:
- **1 = Significant Development Needed:** Rarely demonstrate this competency; struggle consistently
- **2 = Development Needed:** Occasionally demonstrate; inconsistent performance
- **3 = Competent:** Regularly demonstrate; effective in most situations
- **4 = Proficient:** Consistently demonstrate; strong performance; mentor others occasionally
- **5 = Expert:** Exceptional performance; recognized by others; teach/coach regularly

**Critical Instruction:** For each rating, write specific behavioral evidence.

**Example:**

**Empathy — Rating: 2**
- **Behavioral Evidence:**
  - Last week in group project, I didn't notice teammate was overwhelmed until they cried
  - I often think about my response while others are talking (not truly listening)
  - Friends say I give advice too quickly without understanding their situation first
- **Why Rating 2 Not 1:** I do care about others' feelings; I just struggle to read them accurately in the moment

**Empathy — Rating: 4**
- **Behavioral Evidence:**
  - In field trip reflection group, peers said I made everyone feel heard
  - I regularly check in with teammates: "How are you feeling about this deadline?"
  - Last month, I sensed roommate was stressed about exams before they mentioned it, offered help
- **Development Area:** Still working on empathy across cultural differences (CQ connection)

**Step 3: Identify Top Strengths & Development Needs (5 min)**

- **Top 3 EI Strengths:** Which competencies did you rate 4-5?
- **Top 3 EI Development Needs:** Which competencies did you rate 1-2?
- **Reflection Question:** Are your ratings consistent with feedback you've received from others (mentor, peers, family)? If not, why might there be a gap? (Johari Window)

### Tutor Facilitation Notes

**Setup (Before Activity):**
- Distribute ESCI competency descriptions handout with behavioral indicators
- Ensure students understand rating scale
- Emphasize importance of honest self-assessment (this is FOR them, not graded on accuracy)

**During Activity:**
- Circulate to answer questions about competency definitions
- If students struggle with behavioral evidence, prompt: "Tell me about a recent situation where this competency did or didn't show up"
- Watch for common patterns:
  - Rating everything 3 (avoiding extremes) — push for differentiation
  - No behavioral evidence (just guessing) — insist on specific examples
  - Overestimating (common with Emotional Self-Control) — suggest checking with others

**Common Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "What if I think I'm good at empathy but others say I'm not?"**
A: "That's exactly the Johari Window blind spot from Week 5. Your actual competency level is what OTHERS experience, not just your intention. Ask 2-3 people for honest feedback."

**Q: "Can I be high in Social Awareness but low in Relationship Management?"**
A: "Absolutely. You might read people well (empathy) but struggle to use that information effectively (influence, conflict management). That's common."

**Q: "How do I rate Organizational Awareness if I'm a student, not in organization?"**
A: "Rate based on student contexts: Do you understand power dynamics in group projects? Do you navigate professor relationships effectively? Do you sense unspoken tensions in clubs/teams?"

**Transition to Activity 2:**
- "You've assessed EI. Now let's inventory your transferable skills across other frameworks..."

---

## Activity 2: Transferable Skills Inventory (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Identify current skill levels using WEF and NACE frameworks

### Instructions for Students

**Step 1: WEF Future of Jobs Top 10 Skills Assessment (7 min)**

Rate yourself on each WEF skill (1-5 scale, same as Activity 1):

| WEF Top 10 Skills | Current Rating (1-5) | Behavioral Evidence |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Analytical Thinking | | |
| 2. Resilience, Flexibility, Agility | | |
| 3. Leadership & Social Influence | | |
| 4. Creative Thinking | | |
| 5. Motivation & Self-Awareness | | |
| 6. Technological Literacy | | |
| 7. Empathy & Active Listening | | |
| 8. Curiosity & Lifelong Learning | | |
| 9. Talent Management | | |
| 10. Service Orientation | | |

**Note Overlaps:**
- #7 (Empathy) overlaps with Boyatzis EI — use same rating
- #5 (Self-Awareness) connects to EI Self-Awareness

**Step 2: NACE 8 Career Readiness Competencies Assessment (7 min)**

Rate yourself on each NACE competency (1-5 scale):

| NACE Competencies | Current Rating (1-5) | Behavioral Evidence |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Critical Thinking | | |
| 2. Communication | | |
| 3. Teamwork | | |
| 4. Leadership | | |
| 5. Professionalism | | |
| 6. Career & Self-Development | | |
| 7. Technology | | |
| 8. Equity & Inclusion | | |

**Note Overlaps:**
- #3 (Teamwork) = Boyatzis' Teamwork & Collaboration
- #4 (Leadership) = Boyatzis' Inspirational Leadership
- #2 (Communication) connects to multiple EI competencies

**Step 3: Cultural Intelligence Quick Assessment (Optional but Recommended, 1 min)**

Rate yourself on 4 CQ dimensions (1-5 scale):

| CQ Dimension | Current Rating (1-5) |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Metacognitive CQ (Awareness & Planning) | |
| Cognitive CQ (Cultural Knowledge) | |
| Motivational CQ (Interest & Confidence) | |
| Behavioral CQ (Adaptive Actions) | |

### Tutor Facilitation Notes

**Setup:**
- Provide reference sheets with skill definitions and behavioral indicators
- Project frameworks on screen for easy reference

**During Activity:**
- Emphasize speed over perfection — this is inventory, not deep analysis
- Students may feel overwhelmed by number of skills — reassure this is normal
- Point out overlaps to reduce cognitive load

**Addressing Common Concerns:**

**"These frameworks use different words for similar things!"**
- "Exactly. That's why in Activity 3, you'll choose 8 specific skills that matter for YOUR career, consolidating overlaps."

**"I don't know what 'Talent Management' means as a student."**
- "Think of it as developing others — mentoring juniors, teaching peers, helping friends improve skills. Have you done that?"

**"Everything feels important. How do I prioritize?"**
- "We'll prioritize in Activity 3 based on career relevance and gap size. For now, just assess honestly."

**Transition to Activity 3:**
- "You now have comprehensive self-assessment data. Time to create your strategic skills gap analysis..."

---

## Activity 3: Skills Gap Analysis Creation (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Create comprehensive, actionable skills gap analysis for PDP Part 2

### Instructions for Students

This is your **primary deliverable** for today's tutorial.

**Step 1: Select 8-10 Critical Skills (5 min)**

From your assessments in Activities 1-2, select 8-10 skills that are most critical for YOUR career path.

**Selection Criteria:**
1. **Career Relevance:** Essential for your target industry/role
2. **Development Potential:** Skills you can realistically improve (not fixed traits)
3. **Impact:** High ROI for career success
4. **Balance:** Mix of categories

**Required Mix:**
- **3-4 Technical/Hard Skills** — Industry-specific expertise (e.g., data analytics, graphic design, financial modeling, coding)
- **3-4 Transferable/Soft Skills** — From WEF/NACE (e.g., critical thinking, communication, leadership)
- **2-3 AI-Era Skills** — Human-AI collaboration skills (e.g., context engineering, judgment, creative problem-solving)

**Example for Marketing Career:**
- Technical: Data analytics, SEO/SEM, Graphic design (Adobe Suite), Content writing
- Transferable: Creative thinking (WEF #4), Communication (NACE #2), Empathy (Boyatzis EI)
- AI-Era: Context engineering for AI tools, Critical evaluation of AI outputs, Human judgment in strategy

**Example for Consulting Career:**
- Technical: Financial analysis, PowerPoint/data visualization, Market research, Project management
- Transferable: Analytical thinking (WEF #1), Leadership (NACE #4), Conflict management (Boyatzis EI)
- AI-Era: Synthesizing AI-generated insights, Asking better questions, Contextual judgment

**Step 2: Complete Skills Gap Analysis Table (20 min)**

For each of your 8-10 selected skills, complete this table:

| Skill Name | Skill Category | Current Level (1-5) | Target Level (1-5) | Gap Size | Priority (H/M/L) | Development Strategy | Timeline | Success Metrics |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| | | | | | | | | |

**Column Instructions:**

**Skill Name:** Specific skill (e.g., "Public Speaking" not "Communication")

**Skill Category:** Technical / Transferable / AI-Era

**Current Level (1-5):** From your self-assessment in Activities 1-2

**Target Level (1-5):** Where you need to be in:
- 1 year for short-term goals
- 3 years for medium-term goals

**Gap Size:** Target minus Current (automatically calculated)

**Priority:**
- **High (H):** Large gap + Essential for career + Achievable in timeframe
- **Medium (M):** Moderate gap or moderate career importance
- **Low (L):** Small gap or lower immediate career impact

**Development Strategy:** SPECIFIC actions using deliberate practice principles

**BAD Example:** "Improve public speaking"
**GOOD Example:** "Join NEU Toastmasters (Sept 2025), present in 3 classes per semester, record presentations and review weekly, attend public speaking workshop (Jan 2026), practice 10-min daily using structured exercises"

**Timeline:** When will you work on this?
- Year 1: Month-by-month (e.g., "Sept 2025 - June 2026")
- Years 2-3: By semester or quarter

**Success Metrics:** How will you know you've improved?
- Behavioral indicators (observable actions)
- Feedback from others
- Performance outcomes
- Self-assessment improvement

**Example:** "Behavioral: I speak confidently without reading slides, maintain eye contact, handle Q&A smoothly. Feedback: 3 peers say 'you've improved significantly'. Performance: Successfully present PDP in final oral exam with score 80+. Self-assessment: Rate myself 4 on public speaking."

**Step 3: Prioritize & Validate (5 min)**

- **Check Priority Distribution:** Do you have 3-4 High priority skills? (If everything is High, you haven't prioritized)
- **Validate Achievability:** Are 1-year targets realistic? (Max +2 levels in one year with intensive practice)
- **Check Specificity:** Do development strategies pass the "could someone else follow this plan?" test?
- **Resource Reality:** Do you have access to resources mentioned in strategies?

### Tutor Facilitation Notes

**Setup:**
- Provide Skills Gap Analysis template (digital or printed)
- Display exemplar completed table on screen
- Have career-specific skill lists available for common paths (Marketing, Finance, Consulting, HR, Tech)

**During Step 1 (Skill Selection):**
- Circulate to help students identify career-relevant skills
- Common challenge: Students choose too many transferable skills, not enough technical
  - Prompt: "What hard skills do job descriptions in your field require?"
- Common challenge: Students skip AI-era skills
  - Prompt: "How will you work WITH AI in your future role? What human skills complement AI?"

**During Step 2 (Table Completion):**
- This is the most time-intensive activity — ensure students stay focused
- Watch for common mistakes:

**Mistake #1: Vague Development Strategies**
- Student writes: "Practice more"
- Intervention: "Practice WHAT, WHEN, HOW OFTEN, WITH WHOM, USING WHAT RESOURCES?"

**Mistake #2: Unrealistic Targets**
- Student: Current Level 1 → Target Level 5 in 1 year
- Intervention: "That's expert level. Even with intensive practice, 1→3 or 1→4 is more realistic in one year. Save 5 for 3-year target."

**Mistake #3: No Success Metrics**
- Student writes: "I'll feel more confident"
- Intervention: "Feelings are important but subjective. What OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOR will change? What will OTHERS notice?"

**Mistake #4: Generic Skills, Not Specific**
- Student lists: "Communication"
- Intervention: "Communication is too broad. Be specific: Public speaking? Written communication? Cross-cultural communication? Active listening? Persuasion?"

**Providing Examples:**
- Have 2-3 fully completed exemplar rows ready
- Share anonymized examples from past successful PDPs (with permission)

**Time Management:**
- At 10 min mark: "You should have 3-4 skills completed"
- At 15 min mark: "You should have 6+ skills completed"
- If students are behind, suggest: "Focus on your top 5 High priority skills first, add others later"

**Supporting Struggling Students:**
- If student is stuck on development strategy, ask:
  - "How do experts in this skill develop it?"
  - "What courses, workshops, or resources are available?"
  - "Who could mentor you in this skill?"
  - "What deliberate practice would help?" (specific goals, feedback, weakness focus, variation, consistency)

**During Step 3 (Validation):**
- Quick peer check: "Turn to neighbor, share your top 3 priority skills. Do they make sense for your career?"
- Self-check questions:
  - "If your mentor saw this, would they say it's realistic?"
  - "Could you start working on High priority skills THIS WEEK?"

**Transition to Activity 4:**
- "You've created comprehensive gap analysis. Now let's get external perspective through peer feedback..."

---

## Activity 4: Peer Feedback Exchange (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice giving/receiving constructive feedback on interpersonal skills

### Instructions for Students

This activity develops two skills simultaneously:
1. **Receiving feedback gracefully** (Self-Management EI)
2. **Giving constructive feedback effectively** (Relationship Management EI)

**Step 1: Pair Up & Choose Skills (3 min)**

- Find a partner (ideally someone you've worked with in group activities)
- Each person selects ONE interpersonal skill from their Skills Gap Analysis to receive feedback on

**Good Choices:**
- Empathy
- Active listening
- Teamwork & collaboration
- Conflict management
- Communication clarity
- Leadership
- Adaptability in groups
- Professionalism

**Not Suitable for This Activity:**
- Technical skills (partner can't assess your Excel skills from class interactions)
- Internal skills (motivation, self-awareness — partner can't observe directly)

**Step 2: Partner A Receives Feedback (5 min)**

**Partner A (Receiver):**
- State which skill you want feedback on
- Ask: "Based on our interactions in this class, what have you observed about my [skill]? What's a strength? What's an area for growth?"
- **Critical:** Listen without defending, explaining, or justifying
- Take notes
- Say "Thank you" when finished

**Partner B (Giver):**
- Use SBI Feedback Model:
  - **Situation:** "In last week's group discussion..."
  - **Behavior:** "I noticed you interrupted twice when others were speaking..."
  - **Impact:** "...which made it hard for quieter members to contribute."
- Balance: Share one strength, one area for growth
- Be specific (use examples)
- Focus on observable behavior, not personality traits
- Phrase growth area constructively: "I'd encourage you to..." not "You're bad at..."

**Step 3: Partner B Receives Feedback (5 min)**

- Reverse roles
- Partner B receives feedback on their chosen skill
- Partner A gives feedback using SBI model

**Step 4: Reflection (2 min)**

Individually reflect in writing:
- **What did you learn about yourself from this feedback?**
- **Did the feedback align with your self-assessment? If not, why might there be a gap?**
- **How will you integrate this feedback into your Skills Gap Analysis or development strategy?**
- **How did it feel to give/receive feedback? (Practicing EI self-awareness)**

### Tutor Facilitation Notes

**Setup:**
- Model SBI feedback format with example before students pair up
- Set serious but supportive tone: "This is professional development practice, not criticism session"
- Remind: "The ability to receive feedback without defensiveness is HIGH emotional intelligence"

**Example SBI Feedback (Model This):**

**Weak Feedback:**
"You're not a good listener."

**Strong SBI Feedback:**
"Situation: In our field trip debrief discussion last week,
Behavior: I noticed you were checking your phone while others shared reflections,
Impact: which made it seem like you weren't engaged with what they were saying. I'd encourage you to practice active listening by putting devices away and making eye contact during group discussions."

**During Activity:**
- Ensure pairs are actually using SBI format (circulate and listen)
- Intervene if feedback becomes too harsh or too vague
- Watch for defensive reactions — if you see them, pause and coach: "Remember, feedback is a gift. You don't have to agree, but practice receiving it gracefully."

**Common Challenges:**

**Challenge: Students give only positive feedback (avoiding growth areas)**
- Intervention: "Growth feedback isn't mean — it's helpful. What would help your partner improve?"

**Challenge: Feedback is too harsh or personal**
- Intervention: "Focus on specific behaviors, not personality. Instead of 'you're disorganized,' say 'I noticed the meeting ran over time, which made it hard to cover all agenda items.'"

**Challenge: Receiver becomes defensive**
- Intervention: "Pause. Take a breath. Your job right now is just to LISTEN, not to agree or disagree. Say 'thank you' and reflect on it later."

**Debrief (After Activity):**
- "Raise your hand if the feedback you received was different from your self-assessment."
- "This is the Johari Window in action — others see things we don't see about ourselves."
- "How many of you will adjust your Skills Gap Analysis based on this feedback?"

**Connection to PDP:**
- "This feedback data is valuable — include it in your PDP Part 2"
- "In your development strategies, you can write: 'Based on peer feedback, I will focus on [specific behavior]'"

**Transition to Activity 5:**
- "Final step: Compile everything into PDP Part 2 draft and prepare for mentor meeting..."

---

## Activity 5: PDP Part 2 Draft & Closing (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Compile work into PDP Part 2 format and prepare for Mentorship Meeting #3

### Instructions for Students

## Tutor Reflection & Preparation Notes

### Post-Tutorial Checklist

**Immediate (End of Tutorial):**
- [ ] Verify all students submitted Skills Gap Analysis
- [ ] Note students who struggled significantly (offer office hours follow-up)
- [ ] Collect common questions for FAQ document

**Within 24 Hours:**
- [ ] Review submitted Skills Gap Analyses for quality
- [ ] Identify patterns in student challenges
- [ ] Email individual feedback to students who need revision guidance
- [ ] Prepare exemplar submissions to share (with student permission)

**Before Next Tutorial:**
- [ ] Compile FAQ based on today's questions
- [ ] Create supplementary resources for students struggling with development strategies
- [ ] Coordinate with mentorship coordinators: Are students scheduling Meeting #3?

### Common Student Challenges & Interventions

**Challenge 1: Paralysis by Perfectionism**
- Student can't choose skills because "everything seems important"
- **Intervention:** "You can't develop everything at once. Choose 3 skills to focus on THIS YEAR. List others as 3-year goals. You'll revise this plan annually anyway."

**Challenge 2: Vague Development Strategies**
- Student writes generic plans: "Practice more," "Work harder"
- **Intervention:** Use deliberate practice prompting questions:
  - "Practice WHAT specifically?"
  - "HOW OFTEN will you practice?"
  - "WHO will give you feedback?"
  - "WHEN will you do this?" (specific times)
  - "WHAT RESOURCES do you need?"

**Challenge 3: Overconfidence or Underconfidence**
- Student rates everything 4-5 OR everything 1-2
- **Intervention:** "Compare your ratings with peer feedback. Ask your mentor in Meeting #3 to validate your self-assessment. Look for behavioral evidence — what have you actually DONE that demonstrates this level?"

**Challenge 4: Technical Skills Omission**
- Student selects only soft skills, ignores technical requirements
- **Intervention:** "Look at 5 job descriptions for your target role. What technical skills appear repeatedly? You need those, even if they're less exciting to develop."

**Challenge 5: Unrealistic Timelines**
- Student plans to develop 10 skills to expert level in one year
- **Intervention:** "Research shows 1 level improvement takes 3-6 months of deliberate practice. Prioritize 3-4 skills max for intensive development this year. Others can be maintained or slowly improved."
