// Week 7: Transferable Skills & Emotional Intelligence
// Questions: 12

$CATEGORY: PPDK66B - Week 7

::WEF Future of Jobs Report::According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025, what percentage of core skills will change by 2030?{
=39% #Correct! Nearly 4 in 10 skills required in the workplace will be different within 5 years, emphasizing the importance of developing transferable skills that remain valuable across contexts.
~25% #Incorrect. The actual figure is higher—39% of core skills will change by 2030.
~50% #Incorrect. While significant change is expected, the WEF reports 39%, not half of all skills.
~70% #Incorrect. 70% refers to the percentage of employers who consider analytical thinking essential, not the percentage of skills that will change.
####The WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 found that <b>39% of core skills will change by 2030</b>. This rapid skills disruption means that technical skills become obsolete quickly—accelerated by AI—while transferable skills remain valuable across jobs, industries, and decades. Vietnamese employers already prioritize adaptability and continuous learning to navigate this change. The key takeaway\: By developing foundational competencies that transfer across contexts, you prepare for an unpredictable future. See Week 7 slide 1.}

::WEF Top 10 Core Skills::What is the \#1 most essential core skill for 2025-2030 according to the World Economic Forum, valued by 70% of employers?{
=Analytical thinking #Correct! Analytical thinking tops the list at 70% of employers, representing problem-solving across contexts rather than memorizing answers.
~Creative thinking #Incorrect. Creative thinking is \#4 on the WEF list, not \#1. Analytical thinking is the most essential skill.
~Technological literacy #Incorrect. Technological literacy is \#6. Analytical thinking is the top-ranked skill valued by 70% of employers.
~Leadership and social influence #Incorrect. Leadership and social influence is \#3. The most essential skill is analytical thinking.
####The WEF surveyed 1,000+ companies representing 14 million workers in 55 economies and found <b>analytical thinking</b> is the \#1 core skill, valued by 70% of employers. This skill means problem-solving across contexts, not memorizing answers. Notice what's NOT on the list—no specific technical tools or job-specific expertise. The top skills are transferable human capabilities. Only 40% said AI/big data skills are essential—human skills are more universal than technical skills. This connects to Week 1\: The skills that make you irreplaceable are human skills. See Week 7 slide 4.}

::NACE Career Readiness Competencies::How does the NACE framework differ from the WEF framework in identifying essential career competencies?{
=NACE focuses on employer-validated competencies developed collaboratively by career services and corporate recruiters, while WEF focuses on global employer surveys #Correct! NACE represents a collaboration between university career services and HR/recruiting leaders (revised 2024), while WEF surveys global employers. Both are valuable but have different validation approaches.
~NACE is only relevant to the United States, while WEF is globally applicable #Incorrect. While NACE originated in the US, it is globally recognized and widely adopted. Both frameworks have international relevance.
~NACE focuses only on technical skills, while WEF focuses on soft skills #Incorrect. Both NACE and WEF emphasize transferable skills. NACE's 8 competencies include critical thinking, communication, teamwork, and other soft skills.
~NACE is for graduate students only, while WEF is for all workers #Incorrect. While NACE was developed for college career readiness, the competencies apply broadly. Both frameworks are relevant across career stages.
####<b>NACE (National Association of Colleges and Employers)</b> developed 8 competencies collaboratively between career services professionals and corporate recruiters, revised in March/April 2024. <b>WEF (World Economic Forum)</b> identifies Top 10 skills through surveys of 1,000+ employers globally. Both frameworks overlap significantly (critical thinking, communication, professionalism, self-development) but NACE uniquely emphasizes <b>Equity & Inclusion</b> (\#8), recognizing cultural competence as a professional skill. Vietnamese students entering multinational companies need both global (WEF) and employer-validated (NACE) frameworks for comprehensive skill development. See Week 7 slide 5.}

::Goleman's Emotional Intelligence Framework::What are Goleman's four domains of emotional intelligence?{
=Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management #Correct! These four domains organize EI into SELF (awareness, management) and OTHERS (awareness, management), providing a logical framework for developing interpersonal effectiveness.
~Emotional Control, Empathy, Communication, Leadership #Incorrect. While these relate to EI, Goleman's specific framework uses Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management.
~Intrapersonal Skills, Interpersonal Skills, Adaptability, Stress Management #Incorrect. This describes the Bar-On EQ-i model, not Goleman's framework.
~Perceiving Emotions, Using Emotions, Understanding Emotions, Managing Emotions #Incorrect. This describes the MSCEIT (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso) model, not Goleman's framework.
####Goleman's 4 domains of emotional intelligence organize the complexity of "people skills" into a logical framework\: <b>SELF</b>\: (1) Self-Awareness (knowing your emotions, strengths, weaknesses), (2) Self-Management (controlling impulses, adapting, staying positive). <b>OTHERS</b>\: (3) Social Awareness (empathy, reading organizational dynamics), (4) Relationship Management (influence, coaching, collaboration, leadership). Notice the flow\: Self → Others, Awareness → Management. You can't manage what you don't notice (Domain 1 is foundational). Research shows 71% of employers value EI more than technical skills. Unlike IQ, EI can be developed at any age through intentional practice. See Week 7 slides 7-8.}

::Emotional Intelligence Application::A professional is very aware of when they feel frustrated (high Self-Awareness) but frequently yells at colleagues during stressful situations (low Self-Management). What does this demonstrate about emotional intelligence?{
=High EI requires both awareness AND management; awareness alone is insufficient for effectiveness #Correct! This person knows they're angry but can't control their response. Emotional self-control means strategic expression, not suppression. All four EI domains must work together.
~This person has high overall EI because they are self-aware #Incorrect. Self-awareness is only one of four EI domains. Without self-management, awareness doesn't lead to effective behavior.
~Yelling at colleagues is acceptable as long as you're aware of your emotions #Incorrect. High EI includes managing emotions appropriately, not just recognizing them. Awareness without management is low EI.
~This demonstrates high Social Awareness #Incorrect. This scenario illustrates the gap between Self-Awareness and Self-Management, not Social Awareness (which relates to understanding others).
####This scenario illustrates the critical relationship between Goleman's EI domains\: <b>If you have high Self-Awareness but low Self-Management, you KNOW you're angry but yell anyway—that's low overall EI.</b> Conversely, high Self-Management without Social Awareness means you're calm but miss that a colleague is struggling—still ineffective. All four domains must work together\: Self-Awareness (foundation) → Self-Management (using awareness to choose responses) → Social Awareness (reading others accurately) → Relationship Management (applying everything to influence outcomes effectively). Emotional self-control ≠ suppression; it's strategic expression. See Week 7 slide 8.}

::Boyatzis' EI Competencies::How many observable, developable competencies are measured in Boyatzis' Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI)?{
=12 competencies across 4 domains #Correct! Boyatzis identified 12 behavioral competencies\: 1 for Self-Awareness, 4 for Self-Management, 2 for Social Awareness, and 5 for Relationship Management. These are skills you can develop, not fixed personality traits.
~8 competencies across 2 domains #Incorrect. The ESCI measures 12 competencies across Goleman's 4 domains, not 8 competencies.
~16 competencies across 4 domains #Incorrect. While there are 4 domains, Boyatzis identified 12 specific competencies, not 16.
~5 competencies for each domain (20 total) #Incorrect. The ESCI has 12 total competencies distributed unevenly\: Self-Awareness (1), Self-Management (4), Social Awareness (2), Relationship Management (5).
####Boyatzis' <b>ESCI (Emotional and Social Competency Inventory)</b> measures <b>12 observable, developable competencies</b>\: <b>Self-Awareness</b> (1)\: Emotional Self-Awareness. <b>Self-Management</b> (4)\: Achievement Orientation, Adaptability, Emotional Self-Control, Positive Outlook. <b>Social Awareness</b> (2)\: Empathy, Organizational Awareness. <b>Relationship Management</b> (5)\: Coach & Mentor, Conflict Management, Influence, Inspirational Leadership, Teamwork & Collaboration. Unlike personality (relatively stable), these are SKILLS you can develop. Boyatzis proved EI is behavioral—visible actions, not just internal states. The ESCI is the most validated EI measurement tool globally. Research shows training can improve EI competencies by 10-15% in 6 months with sustained practice. See Week 7 slide 9.}

::Cultural Intelligence (CQ)::What are the four dimensions of Cultural Intelligence (CQ)?{
=Metacognitive CQ, Cognitive CQ, Motivational CQ, Behavioral CQ #Correct! These four dimensions represent awareness/planning, knowledge, interest/confidence, and adaptive actions respectively—all essential for cross-cultural effectiveness.
~Awareness, Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes #Incorrect. While these are general learning categories, the CQ framework specifically uses Metacognitive, Cognitive, Motivational, and Behavioral dimensions.
~Understanding, Empathy, Adaptation, Communication #Incorrect. These relate to cultural competence but are not the four CQ dimensions validated by research.
~National Culture, Ethnic Culture, Organizational Culture, Generational Culture #Incorrect. These are types of cultural contexts CQ applies to, not the four dimensions of CQ capability.
####Cultural Intelligence has <b>four validated dimensions</b>\: (1) <b>Metacognitive CQ</b> — Awareness and planning (checking assumptions before/during/after interactions, researching cultural norms). (2) <b>Cognitive CQ</b> — Knowledge of cultures (understanding systems, customs, values, Hofstede's dimensions). (3) <b>Motivational CQ</b> — Interest and confidence (intrinsic curiosity, persistence in cross-cultural situations). (4) <b>Behavioral CQ</b> — Adaptive actions (code-switching, adjusting communication style appropriately). Key distinction\: <b>EI \= understanding emotions across people; CQ \= understanding norms, values, behaviors across cultures.</b> Both are essential for global careers and ASEAN integration. See Week 7 slides 11-12.}

::Cultural Intelligence vs. Emotional Intelligence::How does Cultural Intelligence (CQ) differ from Emotional Intelligence (EI)?{
=EI focuses on understanding emotions across people; CQ focuses on understanding norms, values, and behaviors across cultures #Correct! Both are essential but address different challenges. EI helps you read and manage emotions; CQ helps you navigate different cultural expectations effectively.
~EI is for personal development; CQ is only for international business #Incorrect. Both EI and CQ apply broadly. CQ is relevant for generational differences, organizational cultures, and regional variations—not just international contexts.
~EI and CQ are the same concept with different names #Incorrect. They are distinct capabilities. EI addresses emotional awareness and management; CQ addresses cross-cultural effectiveness.
~EI can be developed through practice; CQ is a fixed personality trait #Incorrect. Both EI and CQ are developable capabilities, not fixed traits. Both can improve through intentional practice and experience.
####<b>EI (Emotional Intelligence) \= understanding emotions across people.</b> It helps you recognize, understand, and manage emotions—yours and others'—regardless of cultural background. <b>CQ (Cultural Intelligence) \= understanding norms, values, behaviors across cultures.</b> It helps you navigate different cultural contexts—national, ethnic, organizational, generational. <b>Example</b>\: High EI helps you notice a colleague is upset; High CQ helps you understand that in their culture, direct confrontation is inappropriate, so you address the issue indirectly. Vietnamese students have a natural advantage\: navigating Vietnamese family culture + Western academic culture daily—that's CQ in action. Both capabilities are essential for effectiveness in multicultural workplaces. See Week 7 slide 11.}

::Vietnam Employment Context::According to Tran et al. (2022) research on regional Vietnamese employers, what key insight distinguishes their priorities from generic global frameworks?{
=Vietnamese employers value context-specific application over generic skills #Correct! Employers prioritize continuous self-learning, resilience, empathy for local communities, and communication adjusted to context—emphasizing 'think globally, act locally.'
~Vietnamese employers only value technical skills, not soft skills #Incorrect. Vietnamese employers actually prioritize transferable skills like continuous learning, resilience, empathy, and contextual communication.
~Vietnamese employers have identical priorities to Western employers #Incorrect. While there's overlap with global frameworks, Vietnamese employers distinctly emphasize context-specific application and empathy for local communities.
~Vietnamese employers don't value emotional intelligence #Incorrect. Vietnamese employers value empathy and contextual communication—both core EI competencies—as essential skills.
####Tran et al. (2022) studied employers in regional Vietnam (not just Hanoi/HCMC) and found four key priorities\: (1) <b>Continuous self-learning</b> (ongoing development after graduation, not just degrees). (2) <b>Resilience & adaptability</b> (handling Vietnam's rapid growth and change—appears in WEF \#2 and NACE). (3) <b>Empathy for local communities</b> (understanding customers/employees/stakeholders in Vietnamese context—not just importing Western practices). (4) <b>Communication in context</b> (adjusting formality, directness, language appropriately—high Behavioral CQ). The key insight\: <b>Vietnamese employers value context-specific application over generic skills.</b> Implication\: Combine international frameworks (global competitiveness) with Vietnam-specific effectiveness. Think globally, act locally. See Week 7 slide 13.}

::Skills Gap Analysis::What is the correct sequence of steps in conducting a Skills Gap Analysis for your Personal Development Plan?{
=Identify Target Skills → Self-Assess Current Level → Define Target Level → Prioritize Gaps → Create Development Strategies #Correct! This logical 5-step process moves from identifying what matters, to understanding where you are, to planning how to develop systematically.
~Define Target Level → Identify Target Skills → Self-Assess Current Level → Create Development Strategies → Prioritize Gaps #Incorrect. You must identify which skills matter before defining target levels. Prioritizing gaps comes before creating detailed strategies.
~Self-Assess Current Level → Identify Target Skills → Prioritize Gaps → Define Target Level → Create Development Strategies #Incorrect. You can't self-assess before identifying which skills to assess. The sequence should start with identifying target skills.
~Prioritize Gaps → Identify Target Skills → Self-Assess Current Level → Define Target Level → Create Development Strategies #Incorrect. You can't prioritize gaps before you know what the gaps are. Start by identifying skills, then assessing current levels.
####The <b>5-Step Skills Gap Analysis Process</b>\: <b>(1) Identify Target Skills</b> — Which 8-10 skills matter most for your career? Use WEF, NACE, Boyatzis EI, CQ frameworks. Choose a mix\: 3-4 technical, 3-4 transferable, 2-3 AI-era skills relevant to YOUR path. <b>(2) Self-Assess Current Level</b> — Rate yourself honestly (1-5 scale) using behavioral evidence. <b>(3) Define Target Level</b> — Where do you need to be in 1 year? 3 years? (1-year target\: +1 or +2 levels; 3-year\: +2 or +3). <b>(4) Prioritize Gaps</b> — High Priority \= Large gap + High career impact + Achievable in timeframe. <b>(5) Create Development Strategies</b> — Specific, actionable plans using deliberate practice principles (not vague intentions like "improve communication"). See Week 7 slide 15.}

::Deliberate Practice Principles::Which example best demonstrates the principle of deliberate practice for developing emotional intelligence?{
=In every team meeting this month, I will summarize what others said before responding, to practice empathy and active listening #Correct! This is specific (team meetings, this month), focused on a weakness (empathy/listening), includes immediate feedback opportunity (others' reactions), and can be repeated with variation.
~I will try to be more emotionally intelligent in general #Incorrect. This is too vague. Deliberate practice requires specific goals, not general intentions.
~I will read three books about emotional intelligence #Incorrect. While reading builds knowledge, deliberate practice requires DOING—practicing the skill with feedback, not just learning about it.
~I will avoid situations that make me uncomfortable emotionally #Incorrect. Deliberate practice principle \#3 is 'Focus on weaknesses'—growth happens in the discomfort zone, not by avoiding challenges.
####<b>Deliberate Practice Principles</b> (adapted from Anders Ericsson's expertise research)\: (1) <b>Set specific goals</b> — "Practice active listening in 10 conversations this week" ✓ not "Be more emotionally intelligent" ✗. (2) <b>Get immediate feedback</b> — Ask for input, don't practice in isolation. (3) <b>Focus on weaknesses</b> — Practice what's uncomfortable (growth happens in discomfort zone). (4) <b>Repeat with variation</b> — Same skill, different contexts (practice empathy with family, classmates, mentor, strangers). (5) <b>Maintain consistency</b> — 30 min daily > 3 hours once/week (builds neural pathways through neuroplasticity). Most people don't improve because they repeat without reflection. <b>Vague goals don't work</b>—specificity, feedback, and consistency drive skill development. See Week 7 slide 16.}

::Personal Development Plan Connection::How should this week's learning on transferable skills and emotional intelligence inform your Personal Development Plan (PDP)?{
=Use WEF/NACE/Boyatzis frameworks to identify 8+ skills for Part 2 Skills Gap Analysis; create SMART goals with deliberate practice strategies; discuss development plans in Mentorship Meeting \#3 #Correct! This week directly feeds into PDP Part 2 (15% of grade) and provides framework for vision statement, SMART goals, and mentor discussions in Meeting \#3.
~Simply list transferable skills in your PDP without specific development strategies #Incorrect. The PDP requires specific development strategies using deliberate practice principles, not just listing skills.
~Focus only on technical skills in your PDP since transferable skills can't be measured #Incorrect. Boyatzis proved EI competencies are behavioral and measurable. Transferable skills should be central to your PDP with specific metrics.
~Wait until Week 11 to think about skills development #Incorrect. The PDP should evolve throughout the semester. You should begin drafting Part 2 (SWOT and Skills Gap) in tutorial this week and share with mentor in Meeting \#3 (Weeks 7-8).
####<b>PDP Integration from Week 7</b>\: <b>Part 2 (SWOT & Skills Gap Analysis — 15% of grade)</b> — Identify 8+ critical skills from WEF, NACE, Boyatzis EI, CQ frameworks. Self-assess current vs. target levels (1-5 scale). Prioritize development needs. Create specific practice strategies using deliberate practice principles. <b>Part 3 (Vision & Goals)</b> — Vision statement reflects values + skills you're developing. SMART goals include skill development targets with action steps, success metrics, and timelines. <b>Mentorship Meeting \#3 (Weeks 7-8)</b> — Bring draft SWOT and Skills Gap Analysis. Ask mentor\: "Which skills matter most in my field?" Request skill development guidance and accountability. The tutorial deliverable is a first draft to share with your mentor, not a final submission. See Week 7 slides 17-18.}
