# 39%

**of core skills will change by 2030**

*(World Economic Forum, 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
Key insight: The WEF surveyed 1,000+ employers representing 14 million workers across 55 economies. Nearly 40% of the skills you need for career success don't even exist yet or will be fundamentally transformed. This is why transferable skills matter - they adapt across contexts.

Students typically ask: "Which skills will change?" and "How do I prepare for skills that don't exist yet?" We'll address both today.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Evaluate** your current transferable skills using global frameworks (WEF, NACE)
2. **Apply** Goleman's emotional intelligence model to workplace scenarios
3. **Assess** your emotional intelligence competency gaps using the ESCI framework
4. **Design** a skills development strategy for your Personal Development Plan

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are directly testable and align with Assessment 3. Today's content will help you complete Part 2 (Skills Gap Analysis) of your PDP. You'll identify which transferable skills and EI competencies to prioritize for development in your 1-year goals.
</speaker-notes>

# Part 1

## Transferable Skills Frameworks

**The skills that travel with you across jobs, industries, and careers**

<speaker-notes>
Transition from intro to core content. Define transferable skills: "Also called 'soft skills' or 'power skills' - competencies that apply across contexts. Unlike technical skills (Python, accounting software), transferable skills (communication, critical thinking) remain valuable regardless of role changes."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" title="What Are Transferable Skills?">

## What Are Transferable Skills?

**Transferable Skills** are competencies that:
- Apply across diverse roles, industries, and career stages
- Complement technical/hard skills
- Remain valuable despite technological change
- Can be developed intentionally through practice

**Examples:**
- Communication, teamwork, critical thinking
- Problem-solving, adaptability, leadership
- Time management, ethical judgment

**Contrast with Technical Skills:**
- Specific software proficiency (Excel, Python)
- Industry-specific knowledge (tax law, genetic sequencing)

<speaker-notes>
Key distinction: Technical skills get you the interview; transferable skills get you promoted and keep you employable across career transitions.

Research from Tushar & Sooraksa (2023) analyzed 30 years of employability studies and found five skills appeared in EVERY decade: problem-solving, communication, teamwork, adaptability, willingness to learn. These are the constants.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="WEF Framework Introduction">

## World Economic Forum: Future of Jobs 2025

**Why This Framework Matters:**
- Based on 1,000+ global employers across 55 economies
- Represents 14 million workers' skill needs
- Updated annually to track labor market trends
- Authoritative source for understanding employer priorities

**Key Finding:** 70% of employers consider analytical thinking essential - more than any other skill

**Vietnam Context:** ASEAN employers increasingly align with WEF framework priorities

<speaker-notes>
Establish credibility: The WEF report is THE global standard for skills forecasting. Released January 2025, so this is cutting-edge data.

Students often ask: "Is this relevant for Vietnam?" Yes - as Vietnam integrates into global value chains, multinational employers and leading Vietnamese companies adopt these frameworks. Your NEU education is preparing you for these employer expectations.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="WEF Top 10 Skills 2025">

## WEF Top 10 Core Skills for 2025

1. **Analytical thinking** (70% of employers)
2. **Resilience, flexibility and agility**
3. **Leadership and social influence**
4. **Creative thinking**
5. **Motivation and self-awareness**
6. **Technological literacy**
7. **Empathy and active listening**
8. **Curiosity and lifelong learning**
9. **Talent management**
10. **Service orientation and customer service**

<speaker-notes>
Note the mix: cognitive skills (1, 4, 6), social-emotional skills (3, 7, 10), and self-management skills (2, 5, 8).

Point out connections to earlier weeks: "Motivation and self-awareness" (#5) ties directly to Week 5 self-assessments. "Curiosity and lifelong learning" (#8) connects to Week 4 self-managed learning.

Students should ask themselves: Which of these 10 are my strengths? Which need development?
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Skills Disruption Forecast">

## Skills Disruption: 2025-2030

**Fastest Growing Skills:**
- AI and big data (59% of employers prioritizing)
- Creative thinking (58%)
- Technological literacy (53%)
- Resilience and adaptability (52%)

**Declining Skills:**
- Manual dexterity and endurance
- Routine information processing
- Memory recall (replaced by AI assistants)

**Implication:** Skills requiring human judgment, creativity, and interpersonal nuance are growing; repetitive cognitive tasks are declining.

<speaker-notes>
Connect to Week 1 (Future of Work) and Week 2 (Career Skills in AI Era): This data confirms what we learned - AI handles routine work, humans provide judgment, creativity, and relationship skills.

Ask students: "Which of the fastest-growing skills do you currently possess? Which should you develop in your 1-year PDP goals?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="NACE Framework Introduction">

## NACE Career Readiness Competencies

**National Association of Colleges and Employers (USA)**

- Developed collaboratively by university career services and HR/recruiting professionals
- Represents employer-validated competencies for college graduates
- Revised March 2024 (most current version)
- Used by 1,500+ US colleges and increasingly adopted globally

**Why It Matters:** Translates employer expectations into student-friendly competency language

<speaker-notes>
NACE provides a complementary framework to WEF. Where WEF is macro (global labor market trends), NACE is micro (what makes a college graduate employable immediately after graduation).

This framework is especially useful for your PDP because it defines specific behaviors for each competency - you can self-assess using their descriptors.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="NACE 8 Competencies">

## NACE's 8 Career Readiness Competencies

1. **Critical Thinking** - Logical analysis, sound judgment
2. **Communication** - Clear exchange across contexts and audiences
3. **Teamwork** - Collaboration with diverse viewpoints
4. **Leadership** - Leveraging strengths to achieve goals
5. **Professionalism** - Effective work habits, integrity, accountability
6. **Career & Self-Development** - Continuous learning, reflection
7. **Technology** - Ethical use to enhance efficiency
8. **Equity & Inclusion** - Engaging across cultures, anti-racist practices

<speaker-notes>
Note overlaps with WEF: Critical thinking (WEF #1), teamwork (implicit in WEF #3), professionalism connects to resilience (WEF #2).

Competency #8 (Equity & Inclusion) is unique to NACE and reflects North American emphasis on diversity. This connects to Cultural Intelligence we'll cover later.

Students should consider: "Which competencies do I demonstrate regularly? Which rarely?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="NACE Example: Critical Thinking">

## NACE Competency Deep Dive: Critical Thinking

**Definition:** "Identify and respond to needs based upon an understanding of situational context and logical analysis of relevant information."

**Sample Behaviors:**
- Make decisions and solve problems using sound, inclusive reasoning
- Gather and analyze information from diverse sources
- Demonstrate innovation and adaptability
- Communicate, listen, and use interpersonal skills effectively

**Self-Assessment Question:**
*How frequently do I analyze information from multiple perspectives before making decisions?*
- Always / Often / Sometimes / Rarely / Never

<speaker-notes>
This slide models how to use NACE for self-assessment. Each competency includes behavioral indicators you can rate yourself against.

For your PDP Skills Gap Analysis, you can adapt this format: "Critical Thinking - Current Level: 3/5 (I analyze multiple perspectives sometimes but not consistently) - Target Level: 4/5 - Development Strategy: Practice Gibbs' Reflective Cycle after major decisions to build analytical habits."

Encourage students to visit NACE website for full behavioral descriptions.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Vietnam Employability Context">

## Transferable Skills in Vietnam Context

**Research: Tran et al. (2022) - Regional Vietnam Employers**

**Most Valued Attributes:**
1. **Continuous self-learning** - Proactive skill updating
2. **Resilience and adaptability** - Handling ambiguity
3. **Empathy for local communities** - Cultural sensitivity
4. **Practical problem-solving** - Theory + application

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese employers value humility alongside confidence
- Emphasis on team harmony (collectivist culture)
- Respect for hierarchy while demonstrating initiative

<speaker-notes>
Important context: Global frameworks (WEF, NACE) provide foundation, but Vietnamese employers have culturally-specific emphases. For example, "leadership" in NACE might be interpreted differently in Vietnam's more hierarchical business culture - leading by example and building consensus rather than top-down decision-making.

"Empathy for local communities" is particularly relevant for students planning to work in regional Vietnam or with SMEs serving local markets.

Students should ask: "How do I balance global competencies with Vietnamese workplace cultural norms?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Part 2: Emotional Intelligence">

# Part 2

## Emotional Intelligence

**The ability to understand and manage emotions in yourself and others**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to EI content. Quick definition: "Emotional intelligence (EI or EQ) is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage your own emotions while also recognizing, understanding, and influencing the emotions of others."

Connect back: "WEF listed 'empathy and active listening' as #7 and 'motivation and self-awareness' as #5. These are EI competencies. Let's unpack the full model."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Why Emotional Intelligence Matters">

## Why Emotional Intelligence Matters

**Research Evidence:**
- **71% of employers** value emotional intelligence more than technical skills (Harvard Business School)
- EI predicts **58% of job performance** across all roles (Goleman, 1998)
- Leaders with high EI see **20% higher team productivity** (Consortium for Research on EI)

**Career Impact:**
- More promotions: EI correlates with leadership advancement
- Better collaboration: Teams with high-EI members perform better
- Greater resilience: EI helps navigate setbacks and stress

**Personal Impact:**
- Stronger relationships, better conflict resolution, improved well-being

<speaker-notes>
The 71% statistic is powerful - technical skills get you hired, but EI determines your career trajectory.

Common student concern: "Can EI be developed, or is it fixed?" Research strongly supports development - Boyatzis (2018) shows EI improves with training, coaching, and deliberate practice. This is a teachable, learnable skillset.

Connect to Week 9 (Growth Mindset): EI development requires believing you can improve emotional competencies through effort.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="framework" title="Goleman's Model Introduction">

## Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence Model

**Daniel Goleman** - Pioneering EI researcher, author of *Emotional Intelligence* (1995)

**The Model: 4 Domains**

| Domain | Focus | Key Question |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Self-Awareness** | Understanding your emotions | "What am I feeling and why?" |
| **Self-Management** | Regulating your emotions | "How do I respond constructively?" |
| **Social Awareness** | Understanding others' emotions | "What are they feeling?" |
| **Relationship Management** | Influencing others' emotions | "How do I build positive connections?" |

**Foundation:** Self-awareness is prerequisite for all other domains

<speaker-notes>
Goleman popularized EI in business contexts. His model is most widely used in organizational settings.

Key insight: The domains build on each other. You can't manage your emotions (self-management) if you don't recognize them (self-awareness). You can't influence others' emotions (relationship management) without understanding them (social awareness).

Students should note: Week 5 self-assessments (MBTI, VIA) build self-awareness - the foundation of EI.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Self-Awareness">

## Domain 1: Self-Awareness

**Definition:** Accurately recognizing your own emotions and their effects

**Core Competency:**
- **Emotional self-awareness** - Understanding your feelings, triggers, and patterns

**What It Looks Like:**
- Recognizing when you're stressed, anxious, excited, or frustrated
- Understanding what situations trigger specific emotions
- Knowing your emotional strengths and limitations
- Seeing how your emotions affect your behavior and decisions

**Example:**
*"I notice I become defensive when receiving critical feedback. This stems from my need for approval. Recognizing this pattern helps me pause and listen rather than react."*

<speaker-notes>
Connect to Week 3 (Reflection): Gibbs' Reflective Cycle's "Feelings" stage builds self-awareness. Reflective practice is one path to developing this competency.

Connection to self-assessments: Your MBTI type may influence emotional patterns (e.g., Feeling types may be naturally more attuned to emotions). VIA Character Strengths like "emotional intelligence" or "social intelligence" indicate natural tendencies.

Ask students: "When was the last time you paused to name the emotion you were feeling? Most of us react without recognizing."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="Self-Management">

## Domain 2: Self-Management

**Definition:** Effectively handling your emotions to behave constructively

**Core Competencies (ESCI Model):**
1. **Emotional self-control** - Keeping disruptive emotions in check
2. **Adaptability** - Flexibility in handling change
3. **Achievement orientation** - Drive to meet/exceed standards
4. **Positive outlook** - Seeing opportunities despite setbacks

**What It Looks Like:**
- Staying calm under pressure rather than exploding in anger
- Adapting plans when circumstances change instead of rigid insistence
- Maintaining motivation during challenging projects
- Reframing failures as learning opportunities

<speaker-notes>
Self-management is NOT emotion suppression. It's recognizing emotions (self-awareness) and choosing constructive responses.

Example distinction: Low self-management = "I'm angry, so I'll send a harsh email immediately." High self-management = "I'm angry. I'll take 30 minutes to cool down, then address this professionally."

Connect to Week 8 (Time & Energy Management): Self-management includes managing your energy states and knowing when to take breaks.

Students often struggle with adaptability - plans change constantly in business. Those with high adaptability thrive; those with low adaptability experience chronic stress.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Social Awareness">

## Domain 3: Social Awareness

**Definition:** Understanding others' emotions, needs, and concerns

**Core Competencies (ESCI Model):**
1. **Empathy** - Sensing others' feelings and perspectives
2. **Organizational awareness** - Reading group dynamics and power structures

**What It Looks Like:**
- Noticing when a teammate is struggling even if they don't say so
- Reading body language and tone beyond literal words
- Understanding cultural differences in emotional expression
- Sensing team morale and underlying tensions
- Recognizing informal influence networks in organizations

**Example:**
*"I noticed my colleague seemed withdrawn in meetings this week. I asked privately if everything was okay - they were dealing with a family issue and appreciated the check-in."*

<speaker-notes>
Social awareness is the bridge between self-focused EI (awareness, management) and other-focused EI (relationship management).

Empathy is crucial for leadership and teamwork. Goleman distinguishes three types: cognitive empathy (understanding perspectives), emotional empathy (feeling with others), and empathic concern (motivated to help).

Organizational awareness is political savvy without negative connotations - understanding how decisions really get made, who influences whom, where resistance might come from.

Connection to Cultural Intelligence (upcoming): Understanding emotions across cultural contexts requires cultural knowledge + empathy.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="Relationship Management">

## Domain 4: Relationship Management

**Definition:** Using emotional awareness to interact effectively and build positive relationships

**Core Competencies (ESCI Model):**
1. **Influence** - Persuasion and buy-in
2. **Coach and mentor** - Developing others
3. **Conflict management** - Resolving disagreements constructively
4. **Inspirational leadership** - Guiding and motivating groups
5. **Teamwork** - Collaboration and cooperation

**What It Looks Like:**
- Persuading stakeholders by appealing to their values and concerns
- Providing developmental feedback that encourages growth
- Mediating disputes by acknowledging emotions and finding common ground
- Motivating teams through challenging periods

<speaker-notes>
Relationship management is where EI becomes visible in action. This is what others experience as "high EQ" - the person who navigates conflicts gracefully, brings teams together, inspires effort.

Note these are all leadership competencies. EI is foundational to effective leadership.

For students: You don't need formal authority to use these competencies. Influence, teamwork, and conflict management apply in group projects, mentorship relationships, and early-career roles.

Connect to Assessment 2 (Mentorship): Your mentor relationship is practice ground for relationship management competencies - how do you build rapport? Ask for guidance? Integrate feedback?
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="framework" title="ESCI Framework">

## ESCI: 12 Emotional Intelligence Competencies

**Emotional and Social Competency Inventory** (Boyatzis & Goleman)

| Domain | Competencies |
|--------|--------------|
| **Self-Awareness** | • Emotional self-awareness |
| **Self-Management** | • Emotional self-control<br>• Adaptability<br>• Achievement orientation<br>• Positive outlook |
| **Social Awareness** | • Empathy<br>• Organizational awareness |
| **Relationship Management** | • Influence<br>• Coach and mentor<br>• Conflict management<br>• Inspirational leadership<br>• Teamwork |

**Assessment Method:** 360° evaluation - self, peers, direct reports, managers

<speaker-notes>
The ESCI is one of the most validated EI assessment tools. Unlike self-report measures (which can be inaccurate due to blind spots), the 360° method triangulates how you see yourself with how others experience your EI.

Boyatzis (2018) validated this model across thousands of managers, executives, and students. Strong psychometric properties - it actually predicts performance.

For your PDP: You can use these 12 competencies as part of your Skills Gap Analysis. Rate yourself 1-5 on each, identify 2-3 priority competencies for development, create specific strategies.

Example: "Conflict management: Current 2/5, Target 4/5. Strategy: Read *Crucial Conversations*, practice using 'I statements' in disagreements, seek mentor feedback on conflict situations."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="EI Development Strategies">

## How to Develop Emotional Intelligence

**Evidence-Based Strategies:**

**1. Reflective Practice**
- Keep emotion journal: What did I feel? What triggered it? How did I respond?
- Use Gibbs' Cycle to analyze emotional reactions

**2. Seek Feedback**
- Ask trusted peers: "How do I come across when stressed?"
- Request specific examples of your EI strengths and gaps

**3. Mindfulness & Emotional Labeling**
- Practice naming emotions accurately ("I'm anxious" vs. "I'm stressed")
- Pause before reacting to build self-management

**4. Empathy Practice**
- Actively listen to understand perspectives, not just to respond
- Ask "What might they be feeling?" in every interaction

**5. Observe High-EI Role Models**
- Watch how effective leaders manage emotions and relationships

<speaker-notes>
Key message: EI is developable. Research shows improvement through practice, coaching, and reflection.

Connect to existing course elements:
- Strategy 1: Uses Week 3 reflection frameworks
- Strategy 2: Your mentorship program (Assessment 2) is feedback opportunity
- Strategy 4: Applies directly to Week 12 relationship-building
- Strategy 5: Your mentor and guest speakers (Week 10) are role models

For PDP: These strategies can populate your "Development Strategy" column in Skills Gap Analysis.

Timeline: Meaningful EI development takes 6-12 months of consistent practice. Set realistic 1-year goals.

<slide number="24" layout="section-break" title="Part 3: Cultural Intelligence">

# Part 3

## Cultural Intelligence

**Navigating cultural diversity in global careers**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "We've covered general EI - recognizing and managing emotions. But what happens when you work across cultures where emotional expression, communication styles, and relationship norms differ? That's where Cultural Intelligence becomes essential."

Context: As Vietnam integrates into ASEAN Economic Community and global value chains, Vietnamese graduates increasingly work in multicultural teams, with international clients, or for multinational companies. Cultural intelligence is no longer optional.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="What Is Cultural Intelligence?">

## Cultural Intelligence (CQ)

**Definition:** The capability to function effectively across national, ethnic, and organizational cultures

**Why It Matters:**
- Vietnam is ASEAN's fastest-growing economy with increasing international business
- 62% of Vietnamese companies plan to expand internationally (Vietnam Chamber of Commerce, 2024)
- Multinational corporations employ 30% of business graduates in major cities
- Remote work enables collaboration across cultural contexts

**CQ vs. EI:**
- **EI:** Understanding emotions universally
- **CQ:** Understanding how culture shapes emotional expression, communication, and relationships

<speaker-notes>
Cultural intelligence builds on emotional intelligence. High EI helps you read people; high CQ helps you interpret those readings correctly across cultural contexts.

Example: In Vietnam, direct disagreement may be considered confrontational; in Germany, it's expected professional behavior. Without CQ, you might misinterpret Vietnamese indirectness as agreement or German directness as rudeness.

For NEU students specifically: Many will work for Korean, Japanese, European, or American companies in Vietnam, or with ASEAN partners. CQ determines your effectiveness in these contexts.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="framework" title="4 Capabilities of CQ">

## The 4 Capabilities of Cultural Intelligence

| CQ Capability | Definition | Key Questions |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Metacognitive CQ** | Awareness and planning during cross-cultural interactions | "Am I considering cultural factors in this situation?" |
| **Cognitive CQ** | Knowledge of cultural norms, practices, and values | "What do I know about this culture's conventions?" |
| **Motivational CQ** | Interest and confidence to adapt to cultural diversity | "Am I motivated to learn and adjust?" |
| **Behavioral CQ** | Ability to adapt verbal and non-verbal behaviors | "Can I flex my communication style appropriately?" |

**Development:** All four capabilities can be strengthened through study, travel, reflection, and cross-cultural experiences

<speaker-notes>
The 4 CQ model (Ang & Van Dyne, 2007) is most widely validated framework.

Key insight: You need all four. High cognitive CQ (knowing cultural facts) without behavioral CQ (adapting behavior) doesn't work. High motivational CQ (eagerness to engage) without metacognitive CQ (strategic awareness) can lead to cultural faux pas.

Example progression:
- Metacognitive: "I'm meeting a Japanese client - I should research business etiquette"
- Cognitive: "In Japan, business cards are exchanged formally with both hands"
- Motivational: "I'm excited to learn their customs even if I make mistakes"
- Behavioral: "I'll bow slightly when receiving their business card and study it respectfully"

Students planning international careers should assess and develop all four capabilities.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" title="Developing Cultural Intelligence">

## Strategies to Build Cultural Intelligence

**1. Cognitive CQ: Build Cultural Knowledge**
- Study cultures relevant to your industry/region (ASEAN, Northeast Asia, Europe)
- Learn about values (individualism vs. collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance)
- Research business etiquette differences

**2. Metacognitive CQ: Strategic Awareness**
- Before cross-cultural interactions, pause: "What assumptions am I making?"
- After interactions, reflect: "What surprised me? What did I misunderstand?"

**3. Motivational CQ: Cultivate Openness**
- Approach cultural differences with curiosity, not judgment
- Build self-efficacy through small cross-cultural successes

**4. Behavioral CQ: Practice Adaptation**
- Adjust communication style (directness, formality, pace)
- Modify non-verbal behavior (eye contact, personal space, gestures)

<speaker-notes>
Practical advice for students:

Immediate actions:
- Cognitive: Take advantage of NEU's international partner programs and exchange students - learn about their cultures
- Metacognitive: After working with international classmates or professors, reflect on cultural differences you noticed
- Motivational: Engage with ASEAN Business Club or international student organizations
- Behavioral: Practice adjusting formality levels when speaking English with different audiences

For PDP: Include CQ development if international career is a goal. Example: "Motivational CQ: Current 3/5, Target 4/5. Strategy: Attend ASEAN cultural events monthly, initiate conversations with international students, read *The Culture Map* by Erin Meyer."

Many students worry about making cultural mistakes. Reassure: High CQ includes recovering gracefully from mistakes and learning from them. Perfection isn't the goal; respectful engagement is.

# Part 4

## Designing Your Skills Development Strategy

**Turning assessment into action**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to application: "You've now learned frameworks for transferable skills (WEF, NACE), emotional intelligence (Goleman's 4 domains, ESCI 12 competencies), and cultural intelligence (4 CQ capabilities). Now let's translate this into your Personal Development Plan."

This final section provides structure for PDP Part 2: Skills Gap Analysis.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Skills Gap Analysis Process">

## Creating Your Skills Gap Analysis

**Step 1: Inventory Current Skills**
- Review WEF Top 10, NACE 8 Competencies, ESCI 12 Competencies
- Honestly rate yourself 1-5 on each (1 = significant development needed, 5 = strong competency)
- Gather evidence: When have you demonstrated this skill?

**Step 2: Identify Target Levels**
- What level do you need for your career goals?
- Industry research: Which skills are most critical in your target field?
- Mentor input: Ask "Which skills should I prioritize?"

**Step 3: Prioritize Gaps**
- **High Priority:** Large gap + critical for career goals
- **Medium Priority:** Moderate gap + important but not urgent
- **Low Priority:** Small gap or less relevant to immediate goals

<speaker-notes>
Model the thinking process:

Example: "I rated myself 2/5 on 'Conflict Management' (ESCI competency). I need this at 4/5 because I want to be a team leader. There's a 2-point gap. Given my leadership goals, this is HIGH PRIORITY for development."

Contrast: "I rated myself 3/5 on 'Organizational Awareness.' I need it at 4/5 eventually, but as an entry-level analyst, it's less urgent than technical skills. This is MEDIUM PRIORITY."

Common mistake: Students try to develop everything simultaneously. Emphasize: Pick 3-4 HIGH PRIORITY skills for your 1-year goals. You can't improve 20 skills at once.

The PDP template asks for minimum 8 skills across three categories: technical/hard (3-4), transferable/soft (3-4), AI-era (2-3). Today's content covers categories 2 and 3.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="30" title="Development Strategy Framework">

## Development Strategies: How to Build Skills

**Formal Learning:**
- Workshops, courses, certifications
- Example: "Enroll in LinkedIn Learning 'Emotional Intelligence at Work' course"

**Experiential Learning:**
- Stretch assignments, volunteer leadership roles, projects
- Example: "Lead a student organization event to practice conflict management"

**Social Learning:**
- Mentorship, coaching, peer feedback, observation
- Example: "Ask mentor to observe my communication style and provide feedback"

**Self-Directed Learning:**
- Reading, reflection, deliberate practice
- Example: "Practice active listening in every conversation for 30 days, reflect weekly on progress"

**Measurement:**
- How will you know you've improved?
- Example: "Receive feedback that I handled disagreement constructively" or "Successfully mediate a team conflict"

<speaker-notes>
Most effective development combines multiple strategies. Example plan:

"Develop Emotional Self-Awareness (current 2/5 → target 4/5):
- Formal: Read *Emotional Intelligence 2.0* by Bradberry & Greaves
- Experiential: Keep daily emotion journal for 90 days using Gibbs' Cycle
- Social: Request feedback from 3 close friends on emotional patterns they've observed
- Self-Directed: Practice labeling emotions precisely (not just 'stressed' - anxious? overwhelmed? frustrated?)
- Measurement: Demonstrate ability to articulate emotions and triggers in mentorship reflections"

Timeline matters: Some skills develop in months (e.g., public speaking with practice), others take years (e.g., inspirational leadership). Set realistic 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year targets.

Connect to Assessment 2: Your mentorship program is built-in social learning opportunity - use meetings to discuss skill development and get feedback.

| **CQ:** Behavioral CQ | 2 | 3 | Medium | Study business etiquette in 3 target countries; practice with international students | Adapt communication style appropriately in cross-cultural contexts |

<speaker-notes>
This example shows the exact format students need for PDP Part 2.

Key features:
- Current and target are specific numbers (enables measurement)
- Priority is stated (shows strategic thinking)
- Development strategy is actionable (not vague "improve gradually")
- Success metrics are observable (you'll know when you've achieved them)

Encourage specificity: "Improve communication" is too vague. "Deliver 3 presentations with clear structure, minimal filler words, and positive peer feedback" is measurable.

Students should create 8+ rows like this, distributed across:
- Technical/Hard Skills (3-4 rows): Software, industry knowledge, analytical techniques
- Transferable/Soft Skills (3-4 rows): From today's WEF/NACE/ESCI content
- AI-Era Skills (2-3 rows): From Week 2 content - context engineering, judgment, human-AI collaboration

This table becomes PDP Part 2 and directly informs 1-year SMART goals in PDP Part 3.

## How Today's Content Fits Your PDP

**PDP Part 2: SWOT & Skills Gap Analysis**

**Use Today's Frameworks to Identify:**

**SWOT Strengths/Weaknesses (Internal):**
- Which WEF Top 10 skills are your strengths?
- Which ESCI competencies need development?

**Skills Gap Analysis:**
- Select 3-4 transferable skills from WEF/NACE frameworks
- Include 1-2 EI competencies from ESCI model
- Add CQ if international career is your goal

**PDP Part 3: SMART Goals**
- Your 1-year goals should target HIGH PRIORITY skills from Skills Gap Analysis
- Development strategies from Skills Gap become action steps in SMART goals

<speaker-notes>
Show integration: Today's lecture provides the CONTENT for multiple PDP sections.

Concrete example:
- SWOT Strength: "Analytical thinking (WEF #1) - demonstrated through consistently high grades in quantitative courses"
- SWOT Weakness: "Conflict management (ESCI) - I avoid confrontation, which limits my leadership effectiveness"
- Skills Gap: "Conflict Management: Current 2/5, Target 4/5, High Priority"
- 1-Year SMART Goal: "By August 2026, successfully mediate 3 team conflicts using 'I statements' and active listening, receiving positive feedback from involved parties on constructive process. Action steps: 1) Read *Crucial Conversations* by September 2025, 2) Practice in group project contexts, 3) Seek mentor feedback quarterly, 4) Reflect using Gibbs' Cycle after each conflict situation."

Students often struggle to connect lecture content to assessments. This explicit mapping helps.

Remind: Draft Skills Gap Analysis before next mentorship meeting - get your mentor's input on prioritization.

# Wrap-Up

## Key Takeaways & Next Steps

<speaker-notes>
Transition to conclusion. We've covered substantial content - four frameworks, 3 skill domains, development strategies. Let's consolidate the main points.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="34" title="Key Takeaways">

## Today's Key Takeaways

1. **Transferable skills travel with you** across roles and industries - prioritize developing WEF Top 10 and NACE 8 Competencies

2. **Emotional intelligence is learnable** - use Goleman's 4 domains and ESCI 12 competencies to assess and develop EI systematically

3. **Cultural intelligence is essential** for global careers - develop all 4 CQ capabilities for cross-cultural effectiveness

4. **Strategic skill development requires prioritization** - identify 3-4 HIGH PRIORITY skills for focused 1-year development

5. **Skills gap analysis drives your PDP** - use frameworks from today to complete Part 2 and inform your SMART goals

<speaker-notes>
Emphasize the actionable nature of today's content. This isn't theoretical - these frameworks are tools you'll use immediately in your PDP.

Reinforce the development mindset: "The gap between current and target isn't a deficiency - it's an opportunity. Every skill you develop increases your career resilience and advancement potential."

Connect back to Week 9 preview (Growth Mindset): Your beliefs about whether skills can be developed will determine whether you actually develop them. Research shows: with deliberate practice, all these competencies improve.

## This Week's Tutorial

**Activity: Skills Gap Analysis Workshop**

You will:
1. Self-assess against WEF Top 10 and ESCI 12 Competencies
2. Draft your Skills Gap Analysis table (8+ skills)
3. Prioritize development focus areas
4. Exchange peer feedback on development strategies

**Bring to Tutorial:**
- Notes from today's lecture
- Preliminary self-assessment (1-5 ratings)
- Thoughts on which skills matter most for your career goals

**Output:** Draft Skills Gap Analysis ready for mentor review in Meeting 3

<speaker-notes>
Tutorial is immediately applicable. Students will leave with a concrete draft of PDP Part 2.

The peer feedback component is valuable - classmates can offer perspectives: "Actually, I've seen you demonstrate strong teamwork in group projects - maybe you're underrating yourself" or "Have you considered that conflict management might be more important for your leadership goals than you think?"

Encourage preparation: "The more thought you put into preliminary self-assessment before tutorial, the more productive your workshop time will be."

<slide number="36" title="Assessment Reminders">

## Assessment Reminders

**This Week:**
- **Mentorship Meeting 3** (Week 7-8 recommended window)
  - Focus: Skills development & goals
  - Share your SWOT analysis draft and skills gap priorities
  - Seek mentor feedback on which skills to prioritize
  - Pre-meeting form due 48 hours before meeting

**Coming Up:**
- **Week 8:** Time & Energy Management
- **Week 9:** Growth Mindset & Adaptability
- **Week 10:** Guest Speaker (October 16) - Ms. Ha Linh
- **Week 11:** Personal Development Plan due (November 28)

<speaker-notes>
Timing reminder: If students haven't scheduled Mentorship Meeting 3, they should do so this week. The meeting should happen AFTER today's lecture and tutorial so they can discuss Skills Gap Analysis meaningfully.

Emphasize cumulative nature: Each week's content feeds into the PDP. Week 8 (time management) and Week 9 (growth mindset) will add more developmental strategies.

Gentle pressure: "We're now 7 weeks in, 4 weeks from PDP deadline. If you're not drafting PDP sections incrementally, you'll face a stressful Week 11 crunch. Start writing SWOT and Skills Gap this week while the frameworks are fresh."
