# 39%

**of core skills will change by 2030 — meaning the skills you're developing today must be transferable**

*(World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
This statistic surprises students every time. Nearly 4 in 10 skills required in the workplace will be different within 5 years. Technical skills become obsolete quickly—AI accelerating this—but transferable skills remain valuable across jobs, industries, and decades. Emotional intelligence is increasingly valued as AI handles technical tasks. Vietnamese employers already prioritize adaptability and continuous learning. Students often ask: "How can we prepare if we don't know what skills will be needed?" Answer: By developing foundational competencies that transfer across contexts.

# Transferable Skills & Emotional Intelligence
## The Universal Competencies for Career Success

**Week 7 of 12**

<speaker-notes>
We're past the midpoint—time to apply self-knowledge from Week 5. Last week's field trip to MISA showed real workplace dynamics. This week focuses on DEVELOPABLE competencies that appear in every job description regardless of industry. These skills feed directly into the PDP Skills Gap Analysis (Part 2). At MISA, students observed professionals collaborating, communicating, adapting—those aren't job-specific skills, they're transferable competencies. Common student question: "Are these just soft skills?" Answer: No—WEF calls them "core skills" because they're fundamental, not supplementary.

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="WEF Top 10 Skills">

# Top 10 Core Skills for 2025-2030

**Most Essential:**
1. **Analytical thinking** (70% of employers)
2. **Resilience, flexibility, agility**
3. **Leadership & social influence**
4. **Creative thinking**
5. **Motivation & self-awareness**

**Also Critical:**
6. **Technological literacy**
7. **Empathy & active listening**
8. **Curiosity & lifelong learning**
9. **Talent management**
10. **Service orientation**

*(World Economic Forum, 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
WEF surveyed 1,000+ companies representing 14 million workers in 55 economies. This is THE authoritative global framework. Key moment: Notice what's NOT on the list—no specific technical tools, no job-specific expertise. #1 Analytical thinking (70%) means problem-solving across contexts, not memorizing answers. #2 Resilience/flexibility/agility is what Vietnamese employers especially value (Tran et al., 2022). #5 Motivation & self-awareness is everything students have been working on in this course. #7 Empathy & active listening are core emotional intelligence competencies. Only 40% said AI/big data skills are essential—technical skills are less universal than human skills. This connects to Week 1: The skills that make you irreplaceable are human skills.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="5" layout="framework" title="NACE Competencies">

# 8 Employer-Validated Competencies

1. **Critical Thinking** — Logical analysis, sound judgment
2. **Communication** — Clear exchange across contexts
3. **Teamwork** — Collaborative relationships, diverse perspectives
4. **Leadership** — Leveraging strengths for organizational goals
5. **Professionalism** — Effective work habits, integrity, accountability
6. **Career & Self-Development** — Continuous learning, career planning
7. **Technology** — Ethical use enhancing efficiency
8. **Equity & Inclusion** — Cross-cultural engagement, anti-racist practices

*(National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
NACE is collaboration between university career services and corporate recruiters, revised March/April 2024 based on employer feedback. Widely adopted globally as competency framework for graduate hiring. These 8 competencies consistently appear in job descriptions across industries. Notice overlap with WEF: Critical thinking, Communication, Professionalism, Self-Development. #8 Equity & Inclusion is unique NACE contribution—recognizes cultural competence is professional skill, not just "nice to have." Vietnamese students entering multinational companies need this. Connection to assessments: MBTI helps understand communication/teamwork style, CliftonStrengths shows natural leadership talents, VIA identifies character strengths supporting professionalism. In tutorial, students self-rate on all 8 competencies (1-5 scale), identify which 3 need most development, create specific development strategies.

# Part 2: Emotional Intelligence
## The Science of Interpersonal Effectiveness

<speaker-notes>
We're shifting from skills frameworks to emotional intelligence theory. EI is the foundation underneath many transferable skills. Preview: Goleman's 4 domains (the big picture), Boyatzis' 12 behavioral competencies (specific measurement), how to develop EI intentionally. Common question: "Isn't EI just being nice?" Answer: No—it's about using emotional information effectively for better decisions and relationships.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="quote" title="What is EI?">

> "Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, and to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others."

**— Daniel Goleman, psychologist & author**

**Key Insight:** EI predicts career success more reliably than IQ

*(Goleman & Cherniss, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
Goleman popularized EI in 1990s. His 2024 research with Cary Cherniss represents most current thinking. EI has TWO dimensions: Self (awareness, management) and Others (awareness, management). Not about being nice or suppressing emotions—about USING emotional information effectively. Research shows 71% of employers value EI more than technical skills (HBS, 2024). EI predicts leadership effectiveness, team performance, career advancement. Unlike IQ (relatively fixed), EI can be developed at any age. Vietnamese culture values emotional restraint ("giữ thể diện" — maintaining face). High EI means balancing cultural norms with authentic connection. Key distinction: High EI ≠ always showing emotions; High EI = knowing WHEN and HOW to express emotions appropriately.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Goleman's 4 Domains">

# Goleman's 4 Domains of Emotional Intelligence

**SELF:**
- **Self-Awareness** — Emotional self-awareness, accurate self-assessment, self-confidence
- **Self-Management** — Emotional self-control, adaptability, achievement orientation, positive outlook

**OTHERS:**
- **Social Awareness** — Empathy, organizational awareness, service orientation
- **Relationship Management** — Influence, coach & mentor, conflict management, teamwork & collaboration, inspirational leadership

*(Goleman & Cherniss, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
These 4 domains organize the chaos of "people skills." Notice logical flow: Self → Others, Awareness → Management. Domain 1 (Self-Awareness) is foundation—can't manage what you don't notice. Connects to Week 5 (self-assessment)—Johari Window, knowing your triggers. Example: "I'm frustrated because this task conflicts with my values" (not just "I'm angry"). Domain 2 (Self-Management): Using self-awareness to CHOOSE responses, not react automatically. Emotional self-control ≠ suppression; it's strategic expression. Domain 3 (Social Awareness): Reading others accurately—empathy beyond sympathy. Organizational awareness means understanding power dynamics, politics, culture. Domain 4 (Relationship Management): Applying self-management and social awareness to influence outcomes. Connection Across Domains: If high Self-Awareness but low Self-Management, you KNOW you're angry but yell anyway—that's low EI. If high Self-Management but low Social Awareness, you're calm but miss that colleague is struggling—still ineffective. Interactive question: Which domain is your strongest? Weakest?
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Boyatzis' 12 Competencies">

# 12 Observable, Developable Competencies

**Self-Awareness (1):** Emotional Self-Awareness

**Self-Management (4):** Achievement Orientation, Adaptability, Emotional Self-Control, Positive Outlook

**Social Awareness (2):** Empathy, Organizational Awareness

**Relationship Management (5):** Coach & Mentor, Conflict Management, Influence, Inspirational Leadership, Teamwork & Collaboration

**Measured by:** Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI) — 360° assessment

*(Boyatzis, 2018)*

<speaker-notes>
Richard Boyatzis co-developed the ESCI with Goleman. Most validated EI measurement tool used globally. Unlike personality (relatively stable), these are SKILLS you can develop. Why this matters: Boyatzis proved EI is behavioral—visible actions, not internal states. Each competency has specific indicators you can observe and practice. Achievement Orientation example: Setting and pursuing challenging goals, seeking ways to improve performance. "I want to increase my public speaking rating from 2 to 4 in one year" (specific, measurable). Adaptability: Handling change smoothly. Critical in VUCA world (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous). Example: When group project partner drops out, reorganizing without panic. Empathy: Understanding others' perspectives, feelings, concerns. Listening actively, suspending judgment. Example: Realizing teammate is quiet because overwhelmed, not disinterested. Research: Boyatzis (2018) validated ESCI across managers, executives, students globally. Training programs can improve EI competencies by 10-15% in 6 months. Improvements sustained over years with practice. In tutorial: Complete EI self-assessment based on these 12 competencies, rate yourself 1-5, identify top 3 strengths and top 3 development areas, get peer feedback.

# Part 3: Cultural Intelligence
## Essential for Global Careers

<speaker-notes>
Students may work for Vietnamese company serving international clients, multinational company with diverse team, or study/work abroad. Cultural intelligence determines effectiveness. Preview: 4 dimensions of CQ (Cultural Intelligence), why it matters for Vietnam professionals, how to develop it. Key moment: This isn't diversity training or sensitivity—it's measured capability validated across 755 professionals globally.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="What is CQ?">

# Cultural Intelligence (CQ)

**Definition:** The capability to function effectively across various cultural contexts—national, ethnic, organizational, and generational.

**4 Dimensions:**
1. **Metacognitive CQ** — Awareness & planning (checking assumptions, researching norms)
2. **Cognitive CQ** — Knowledge of cultures (understanding systems, customs)
3. **Motivational CQ** — Interest & confidence (curiosity, persistence)
4. **Behavioral CQ** — Adaptive actions (code-switching, adjusting communication)

*(Gozzoli, Gazzaroli, & D'Angelo, 2018)*

<speaker-notes>
Key distinction: EI = understanding emotions across people; CQ = understanding norms, values, behaviors across cultures. Why it matters: ASEAN integration means working with Thai, Indonesian, Malaysian colleagues. Vietnamese companies expanding regionally (Vinamilk, VinFast, FPT). Multinationals expect cross-cultural collaboration. Four dimensions explained: Metacognitive (checking assumptions before/during/after), Cognitive (understanding cultural systems), Motivational (intrinsic interest, not obligation), Behavioral (code-switching appropriately). Vietnam context: Vietnamese students have natural advantage—bicultural experience (Vietnamese + international education). Many navigate Vietnamese family culture + Western academic culture daily—that's CQ in action. Self-assessment: Which CQ dimension is your strongest? Common pattern: High Cognitive (know facts), Low Behavioral (struggle to adapt actions).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="CQ in Action">

# The 4 Dimensions of Cultural Intelligence in Action

| Dimension | Low CQ Example | High CQ Example |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Metacognitive CQ** | Assumes everyone works like Vietnamese culture | Reflects: "How might hierarchy expectations differ here?" |
| **Cognitive CQ** | Doesn't know Thai greeting customs | Researched wai gesture and when to use it |
| **Motivational CQ** | Avoids interacting with international students | Seeks out cross-cultural friendships actively |
| **Behavioral CQ** | Uses same direct communication everywhere | Adjusts directness based on cultural context |

<speaker-notes>
These examples show CQ as BEHAVIOR, not just knowledge or intention. Development strategies: Metacognitive (before meetings: "What assumptions am I making?"; during: "Am I interpreting correctly?"; after: "What surprised me?"), Cognitive (read about cultures, learn Hofstede's cultural dimensions, attend cultural events), Motivational (reframe discomfort as learning opportunity from Week 9 growth mindset, set goals like "3 conversations with international students this month"), Behavioral (practice code-switching: formal/informal, direct/indirect; observe high-CQ people; get feedback). Vietnam advantage: Colonial history created cultural adaptability. Current ASEAN integration requires CQ. NEU students are bilingual (Vietnamese/English)—leverage that code-switching skill. Connection to PDP: Include CQ as transferable skill especially if planning international career, multinational company, or regional role. Development strategy: Join international student groups, practice English, travel if possible.

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="Vietnam Context">

# What Vietnamese Employers Want

**Research Finding:** Employers in regional Vietnam prioritize:

1. **Continuous self-learning** (lifelong learning mindset)
2. **Resilience & adaptability** (handling change, setbacks)
3. **Empathy for local communities** (understanding context)
4. **Communication in context** (adjusting to audience)

**Key Insight:** Vietnamese employers value **context-specific application** over generic skills

*(Tran, Ngo, Nguyen, & Nguyen, 2022)*

<speaker-notes>
This research studied employers in regional Vietnam (not just Hanoi/HCMC). Shows what matters beyond international frameworks. Key findings: Continuous self-learning (not just "I went to university"—ongoing development after graduation; connects to Week 4 Self-Managed Learning; employers notice if you ask questions, seek feedback, read industry news). Resilience & adaptability (Vietnam's rapid growth creates constant change; COVID-19 forced digital transformation in 6 months; appears in WEF #2, NACE, Boyatzis EI). Empathy for local communities (understanding customers, employees, stakeholders in Vietnamese context; not just importing Western practices; example: Marketing campaign succeeding in Hanoi might fail in Mekong Delta; requires CQ + Social Awareness). Communication in context (adjusting formality, directness, language; speaking to CEO ≠ peers ≠ factory workers; High Behavioral CQ skill). Implication: International frameworks give global competitiveness; Vietnamese research ensures local effectiveness. Combine both: "Think globally, act locally." In PDP: Consider Vietnam market as Opportunity or Threat in SWOT; include context-specific skills; balance international skills with local effectiveness.

# Part 4: Developing Your Transferable Skills
## From Assessment to Action

<speaker-notes>
Theory is valuable but useless without application. This section: Practical strategies for skill development. Preview: Creating skills gap analysis, deliberate practice principles, using mentorship for skill development. Key moment: Students will use these frameworks in tutorial TODAY—everything is immediately actionable.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="Skills Gap Analysis">

# 5-Step Process

1. **Identify Target Skills** — Which 8-10 skills matter most for your career?
2. **Self-Assess Current Level** — Rate yourself honestly (1-5 scale)
3. **Define Target Level** — Where do you need to be in 1 year? 3 years?
4. **Prioritize Gaps** — Which gaps are most urgent/impactful?
5. **Create Development Strategies** — Specific, actionable plans

**Used in:** Personal Development Plan Part 2 (15% of grade)

<speaker-notes>
Step 1 (Identify): Use WEF, NACE, Boyatzis EI, CQ frameworks. Choose mix: 3-4 technical, 3-4 transferable, 2-3 AI-era. Make them relevant to YOUR career path. Example for Marketing: Technical (data analytics, SEO, graphic design), Transferable (creative thinking, communication, teamwork), AI-era (context engineering, human judgment, AI tool proficiency). Step 2 (Self-Assess): Be HONEST—overestimating helps no one. Use behavioral evidence: "I've done X, therefore I rate myself Y." Get input from mentor, peers, professors. Rating guide: 1=Beginner, 2=Developing, 3=Competent, 4=Proficient, 5=Expert. Step 3 (Target): 1-year target realistic (+1 or +2 levels), 3-year ambitious (+2 or +3). Not every skill needs to be 5—strategic choices. Step 4 (Prioritize): High Priority = Large gap + High career impact + Achievable in timeframe. Step 5 (Strategies): SPECIFIC actions not vague intentions. "Improve communication" ❌; "Present in 3 classes, join Toastmasters, record and review myself monthly" ✓. In tutorial: Complete this process for 8 skills, share with peer for feedback, refine for PDP submission.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="content" title="Deliberate Practice">

# How to Actually Get Better

**Deliberate Practice Principles:**

1. **Set specific goals** — "Practice active listening in 10 conversations this week" ✓
2. **Get immediate feedback** — Ask for input, don't practice in isolation
3. **Focus on weaknesses** — Practice what's uncomfortable
4. **Repeat with variation** — Same skill, different contexts
5. **Maintain consistency** — 30 min daily > 3 hours once a week

*(Adapted from Anders Ericsson's expertise research)*

<speaker-notes>
Most people don't improve because they repeat without reflection. Deliberate practice = intentional, focused, feedback-driven skill building. Principle 1 (Specific): Vague goals don't work. "Be more emotionally intelligent" vs. "In every team meeting this month, I will summarize what others said before responding, to practice empathy and active listening." Principle 2 (Feedback): Can't improve what you can't see. Sources: Mentor, peers, recording yourself, self-reflection journals. After presentation, ask 3 people: "What was clearest? What was confusing?" Principle 3 (Weaknesses): Natural tendency is do what we're good at (feels good). Growth happens in discomfort zone. If conflict management is weak, must practice difficult conversations. Principle 4 (Variation): Practice empathy with family, friends, classmates, mentor, strangers—different contexts reveal different challenges. Principle 5 (Consistency): 15 min daily active listening = 105 min/week. 2-hour workshop monthly = 24 min/week average. Consistency builds neural pathways (neuroplasticity). Application examples given in speaker notes. Connection to Mentorship: Share development strategies in Meeting #3, mentor provides feedback and accountability.

<slide number="19" layout="content" title="Summary">

# What We Learned Today

1. **Transferable Skills Frameworks:** WEF (Top 10) and NACE (8 competencies) define globally valued skills
2. **Emotional Intelligence:** Goleman's 4 domains, Boyatzis' 12 behavioral competencies
3. **Cultural Intelligence:** 4 CQ dimensions essential for global careers
4. **Vietnam Context:** Employers value continuous learning, resilience, empathy, context-specific communication
5. **Skills Development:** Use 5-step gap analysis + deliberate practice principles

<speaker-notes>
Recap each point: (1) WEF analytical thinking, resilience, leadership, creative thinking, self-awareness, empathy; NACE critical thinking, communication, teamwork, leadership, professionalism, self-development, technology, equity. These frameworks guide Skills Gap Analysis. (2) 4 Domains: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management; 12 Competencies from Emotional Self-Awareness to Teamwork; EI is developable through intentional practice. (3) Metacognitive/Cognitive/Motivational/Behavioral CQ; essential for ASEAN careers and multinationals. (4) Continuous self-learning mindset, resilience and adaptability, empathy for local communities, communication adjusted to context; balance global competitiveness with local effectiveness. (5) Identify → Self-assess → Define targets → Prioritize → Create strategies; Deliberate practice: Specific goals, immediate feedback, focus on weaknesses, repeat with variation, consistency. Connection to Course: Week 5 revealed WHO you are, Week 7 reveals WHAT you need, Week 11 integrates both into HOW you'll grow. Motivation: "39% of skills changing by 2030 sounds scary—but it's opportunity. The people who thrive will be those who commit to continuous skill development. That's what you're doing in this course: Building the HABIT of intentional growth."

# Questions & Next Steps

**Office Hours:** By appointment — email to schedule

**Next Week:** Time, Energy & Habit Management
- Deep Work principles
- Atomic Habits framework
- Energy management strategies

**Action Items:**
1. Complete tutorial Skills Gap Analysis
2. Schedule/complete Mentorship Meeting #3
3. Share SWOT and skills draft with mentor
4. Continue developing identified skills using deliberate practice

<speaker-notes>
Common anticipated questions: "How do I know if my self-assessment is accurate?" (Compare with feedback from others, look for behavioral evidence, use 360° approach). "What if I have 20 skills gaps, not just 8?" (Prioritize ruthlessly: Impact × Urgency × Achievability; can't develop everything at once; focus on 3-4 high-priority skills per year). "Should I focus on improving weaknesses or leveraging strengths?" (Both, strategically: Develop weaknesses if they're critical gaps, leverage strengths if they're differentiators; CliftonStrengths philosophy: Build strengths to excellence, manage weaknesses to adequacy). "How long does it take to develop a skill?" (Depends on current level, target level, and practice intensity; rule of thumb: 1 level improvement = 3-6 months of deliberate practice). "Is CQ really necessary if I plan to work only in Vietnam?" (Yes: Vietnamese companies hire international talent, ASEAN integration, many have international clients/partners, generational and regional cultural differences within Vietnam require CQ). Next week preview: You have skills gaps identified—now we tackle TIME and ENERGY. How to actually make space for skill development in busy life. Newport's Deep Work + Clear's Atomic Habits + Schwartz's Energy Management. Building systems that support development goals. Action items emphasis: Don't leave tutorial without draft, Meeting #3 is critical, start practicing ONE skill this week, can't develop all simultaneously. Motivational close: "The difference between dreaming about a better career and building one is this: intentional skill development. You now have the frameworks. Tutorial gives you the plan. Daily practice gives you the results. Let's get to work."
