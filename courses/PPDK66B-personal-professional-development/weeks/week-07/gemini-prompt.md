## Cultural Intelligence

**Navigating cultural diversity in global careers**

### Slide 25 (Layout: content)
## Cultural Intelligence (CQ)

**Definition:** The capability to function effectively across national, ethnic, and organizational cultures

**Why It Matters:**
- Vietnam is ASEAN's fastest-growing economy with increasing international business
- 62% of Vietnamese companies plan to expand internationally (Vietnam Chamber of Commerce, 2024)
- Multinational corporations employ 30% of business graduates in major cities
- Remote work enables collaboration across cultural contexts

**CQ vs. EI:**
- **EI:** Understanding emotions universally
- **CQ:** Understanding how culture shapes emotional expression, communication, and relationships

### Slide 26 (Layout: framework)
## The 4 Capabilities of Cultural Intelligence

| CQ Capability | Definition | Key Questions |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Metacognitive CQ** | Awareness and planning during cross-cultural interactions | "Am I considering cultural factors in this situation?" |
| **Cognitive CQ** | Knowledge of cultural norms, practices, and values | "What do I know about this culture's conventions?" |
| **Motivational CQ** | Interest and confidence to adapt to cultural diversity | "Am I motivated to learn and adjust?" |
| **Behavioral CQ** | Ability to adapt verbal and non-verbal behaviors | "Can I flex my communication style appropriately?" |

**Development:** All four capabilities can be strengthened through study, travel, reflection, and cross-cultural experiences

### Slide 27 (Layout: content)
## Strategies to Build Cultural Intelligence

**1. Cognitive CQ: Build Cultural Knowledge**
- Study cultures relevant to your industry/region (ASEAN, Northeast Asia, Europe)
- Learn about values (individualism vs. collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance)
- Research business etiquette differences

**2. Metacognitive CQ: Strategic Awareness**
- Before cross-cultural interactions, pause: "What assumptions am I making?"
- After interactions, reflect: "What surprised me? What did I misunderstand?"

**3. Motivational CQ: Cultivate Openness**
- Approach cultural differences with curiosity, not judgment
- Build self-efficacy through small cross-cultural successes

**4. Behavioral CQ: Practice Adaptation**
- Adjust communication style (directness, formality, pace)
- Modify non-verbal behavior (eye contact, personal space, gestures)

### Slide 28 (Layout: section-break)
# Part 4

## Designing Your Skills Development Strategy

**Turning assessment into action**

### Slide 29 (Layout: content)
## Creating Your Skills Gap Analysis

**Step 1: Inventory Current Skills**
- Review WEF Top 10, NACE 8 Competencies, ESCI 12 Competencies
- Honestly rate yourself 1-5 on each (1 = significant development needed, 5 = strong competency)
- Gather evidence: When have you demonstrated this skill?

**Step 2: Identify Target Levels**
- What level do you need for your career goals?
- Industry research: Which skills are most critical in your target field?
- Mentor input: Ask "Which skills should I prioritize?"

**Step 3: Prioritize Gaps**
- **High Priority:** Large gap + critical for career goals
- **Medium Priority:** Moderate gap + important but not urgent
- **Low Priority:** Small gap or less relevant to immediate goals

### Slide 30 (Layout: content)
## Development Strategies: How to Build Skills

**Formal Learning:**
- Workshops, courses, certifications
- Example: "Enroll in LinkedIn Learning 'Emotional Intelligence at Work' course"

**Experiential Learning:**
- Stretch assignments, volunteer leadership roles, projects
- Example: "Lead a student organization event to practice conflict management"

**Social Learning:**
- Mentorship, coaching, peer feedback, observation
- Example: "Ask mentor to observe my communication style and provide feedback"

**Self-Directed Learning:**
- Reading, reflection, deliberate practice
- Example: "Practice active listening in every conversation for 30 days, reflect weekly on progress"

**Measurement:**
- How will you know you've improved?
- Example: "Receive feedback that I handled disagreement constructively" or "Successfully mediate a team conflict"

### Slide 31 (Layout: content)
