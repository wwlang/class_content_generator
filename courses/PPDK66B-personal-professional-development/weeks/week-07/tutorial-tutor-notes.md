## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Part 1: Quick Review (5 minutes)

**Your role:** Set context and establish assessment mindset

#### Key Messages

1. **Framework purposes:**
   - NACE: Broad employability competencies employers seek in graduates
   - ESCI: Detailed emotional intelligence behavioral competencies
   - CQ: Specific capabilities for cross-cultural effectiveness

2. **Assessment principles:**
   - "Rate what you actually DO, not what you wish or think you should do"
   - "Use recent specific examples as evidence"
   - "Low scores identify opportunities, not failures—this isn't graded on your ratings"
   - "Honest self-assessment is developmentally valuable; inflated self-ratings waste your time"

3. **Process expectations:**
   - "Next 75 minutes are primarily individual work"
   - "I'll circulate to answer questions—raise hand if you need clarification"
   - "Work at your own pace, but aim to finish each assessment within suggested times"
   - "You'll submit complete work to Moodle after tutorial"

#### Anticipated Questions

**Q: "Will you see our individual ratings?"**
A: "Yes, I see your submitted assessments to verify completeness and thoughtfulness. But I'm not evaluating whether your skills are strong—I'm evaluating whether you engaged honestly with the self-assessment process."

**Q: "What if I don't have examples for some competencies?"**
A: "That's valuable data. If you can't identify recent examples, that suggests limited practice with that competency—which makes it a development priority. Note in 'development opportunity' section that you lack examples."

**Q: "Should I rate myself compared to other students or to experts?"**
A: "Rate yourself against the behavioral indicators provided, not against other people. Ask: 'How frequently do I demonstrate these behaviors?' not 'Am I better or worse than my classmates?'"

---

### Part 2: Main Activity (75 minutes)

#### Activity 2.1: NACE Assessment (20 minutes)

**Your role:** Circulate, clarify, ensure progress

**Common clarification needs:**

1. **Rating scale interpretation:**
   - 1 (Developing): You're beginning to practice this; inconsistent demonstration
   - 2 (Competent): You demonstrate this adequately in familiar contexts
   - 3 (Proficient): You demonstrate this reliably across various contexts
   - 4 (Advanced): You demonstrate this consistently and could teach others

2. **"Evidence" versus "Development opportunity":**
   - Evidence: Specific situation where you successfully demonstrated the competency
   - Development opportunity: Specific situation where you struggled or wish you'd performed better
   - Both should be concrete situations, not general statements

3. **Students struggling with examples:**
   - Prompt with context: "Think about group projects, part-time jobs, student organizations, family situations"
   - For competencies with no examples: "If you can't recall any situations, write 'Limited practice—need to seek opportunities' in development section"

**Watch for:**
- Students finishing too quickly (likely not providing specific evidence)
- Students stuck on single competency (suggest moving forward, returning later)
- Confusion about behavioral indicators (pause to clarify with whole group if multiple students struggle)

**Timing checkpoint at 15 minutes:** "You should be finishing your last 1-2 competencies and starting pattern analysis. If you're still on competency 3-4, move more quickly through remaining items—you can add details later."

---

#### Activity 2.2: ESCI Assessment (25 minutes)

**Your role:** Support with competency clarification, encourage domain thinking

**Common clarification needs:**

1. **Self-Awareness versus Self-Management:**
   - Self-awareness: RECOGNIZING your emotions, strengths, limitations
   - Self-management: REGULATING your emotions, CONTROLLING impulses, ADAPTING behavior
   - Example: "I notice I'm getting frustrated" = self-awareness; "I take deep breaths to calm down" = self-management

2. **Social Awareness versus Relationship Management:**
   - Social awareness: UNDERSTANDING others' emotions, organizational dynamics
   - Relationship management: ACTING to influence, develop, collaborate with others
   - Example: "I sense my teammate is stressed" = social awareness; "I offer to help with their workload" = relationship management

3. **Specific competency clarifications:**

   **Organizational Awareness** (students often struggle):
   - This is about understanding power, politics, informal networks
   - University example: Recognizing which professors have influence over curriculum decisions, understanding how student government actually operates, knowing which administrators can approve exceptions
   - Workplace example: Knowing who makes real decisions (vs. who has formal authority), understanding company culture and unspoken rules

   **Inspirational Leadership** (students may think they lack experience):
   - You don't need formal leadership roles to demonstrate this
   - Examples: Taking initiative in group projects to motivate team, articulating compelling vision for student organization event, leading by example in academic integrity
   - If truly no examples, note this as development area

**Watch for:**
- Students rating all competencies similarly (suggests surface engagement)
- Huge gaps between domains (could be real or could reflect misunderstanding—ask about pattern)
- Confusion about "recent example OR challenge" (both are acceptable—success shows capability, struggle shows awareness of development need)

**Timing checkpoint at 20 minutes:** "You should be completing your last 2-3 competencies and starting domain analysis. Calculate average ratings for each domain and answer reflection questions."

---

#### Activity 2.3: CQ Assessment (15 minutes)

**Your role:** Facilitate completion, help with interpretation

**Common clarification needs:**

1. **CQ-Knowledge items (often lowest scores):**
   - Don't expect expert knowledge
   - Rate honestly—many students have moderate to low cultural knowledge
   - This is developable through study and experience

2. **CQ-Strategy items (often misunderstood):**
   - These ask about conscious planning and monitoring during cross-cultural interactions
   - Item 15 ("I plan how I am going to relate..."): Do you think ahead about cultural factors before international meetings, conversations with international students, etc.?
   - If you operate on autopilot, rate low; if you consciously strategize, rate high

3. **CQ-Action items (require behavioral flexibility):**
   - These ask if you actually adjust communication style
   - Different from CQ-Drive (wanting to adapt) or CQ-Knowledge (knowing you should adapt)
   - Rate based on whether you DO modify verbal/nonverbal behavior, not whether you think you should

**Interpretation support:**

When students reach profile analysis:
- "Compare your four factor scores. Which is highest? Lowest?"
- "Common patterns: High drive + low knowledge = enthusiasm without cultural understanding; high knowledge + low action = understanding without behavioral flexibility"
- "For IBD students pursuing international careers, ideally develop all four factors. But if prioritizing, start with CQ-Drive and CQ-Strategy—motivation and metacognitive awareness enable learning the other factors"

**Timing checkpoint at 12 minutes:** "You should be finishing the 20 items and calculating factor averages. Complete your profile analysis and reflection questions."

---

#### Activity 2.4: Development Plan Creation (15 minutes)

**Your role:** Guide prioritization, ensure specificity

**Prioritization guidance:**

Help students select 2-3 competencies strategically:

1. **Gap criterion:** Choose competencies with largest gap between current and needed capability
2. **Importance criterion:** Choose competencies critical for specific career goals
3. **Foundation criterion:** Self-awareness enables other EI competencies; CQ-Drive enables other CQ factors
4. **Opportunity criterion:** Choose competencies you can practice THIS SEMESTER in available contexts

**Common prioritization questions:**

**Q: "Should I focus on weaknesses or build on strengths?"**
A: "Depends on context. For competencies below threshold (can't function without them), focus on weaknesses to reach adequacy. For competencies that differentiate performance, consider building strengths to excellence. Generally, one weakness + one strength development is balanced."

**Q: "I have many low-rated competencies. How do I choose?"**
A: "Start with foundational competencies. Self-awareness enables self-management and social awareness. CQ-Drive enables other CQ factors. Critical thinking enables many other NACE competencies. Or choose competencies you can practice immediately—if you're in group project now, teamwork and conflict management have natural practice contexts."

**Q: "Can I work on more than 3 competencies?"**
A: "You CAN, but research shows focused effort on 2-3 competencies produces better results than diffused effort across many. If you genuinely have capacity for more, ensure you have SPECIFIC practice plans for each, not vague intentions."

**Development strategy specificity:**

Push for concrete, actionable strategies, not vague aspirations.

**Vague:** "Practice empathy more"
**Specific:** "In team meetings, paraphrase others' points before responding; ask one clarifying question to understand their perspective; observe nonverbal cues consciously"

**Vague:** "Improve communication"
**Specific:** "Draft important emails, wait 2 hours, revise before sending; practice presentations aloud 3 times before delivering; request specific feedback on clarity after presentations"

**Vague:** "Develop cultural intelligence"
**Specific:** "Before conversations with international students, review their home country's communication norms; after cross-cultural interactions, write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what worked/didn't work; join International Student Association events monthly"

**Practice opportunity specificity:**

Ensure students identify actual contexts available THIS SEMESTER.

Valid practice contexts at NEU:
- Current group projects (teamwork, conflict management, influence)
- Part-time jobs or internships (professionalism, communication, adaptability)
- Student organizations (leadership, organizational awareness)
- Interactions with international students/faculty (cultural intelligence)
- Tutorial discussions and presentations (communication, empathy)
- Academic challenges (emotional self-control, achievement orientation, adaptability)

**Timing checkpoint at 12 minutes:** "You should be finishing your action plans for 2-3 competencies. Complete the implementation commitment section—when will you review progress? Who can provide feedback?"

---

### Part 3: Before Next Class (10 minutes)

#### Peer Discussion (8 minutes)

**Your role:** Organize pairs, monitor engagement, manage time

**Instructions to give:**

"Find a partner—ideally someone you don't normally work with. You'll each share for 4 minutes (8 minutes total). Share:
- Which 2-3 competencies you're prioritizing
- What development strategies you'll try
- What practice opportunities you're planning
- What challenges you anticipate

Listen actively—you might get ideas for your own development."

**While students discuss:**
- Circulate to ensure both partners are sharing (not one dominating)
- Listen for interesting insights or challenges you might address in closing
- Give time warnings: "4 minutes—switch speakers" and "7 minutes—wrap up your conversations"

**Purpose:** Articulating plans strengthens commitment (psychological research on public commitment). Hearing peers' approaches may generate additional ideas.

---

#### Closing Reflection & Next Steps (2 minutes)

**Your role:** Quick individual reflection, then connect to assessments and next week

**Instructions:**

"Take 1 minute for quick individual reflection. Complete these sentences in your notes:
1. The most surprising insight from today's assessment was...
2. The competency I'm most committed to developing is...
3. One concrete action I'll take this week is..."

(60 seconds silence)

**Key closing messages:**

"Three connections to remember:

**First, Assessment 3 (Self-Portrait Video):** Many of you will highlight a transferable skill or EI competency. Today's assessment provides evidence for your choices. If showcasing a strength, use specific examples from your NACE/ESCI ratings. If explaining development, use insights from your gap analysis.

**Second, Assessment 5 (Professional Portfolio):** Employers want evidence of competencies. Practice translating self-awareness into professional language. Your development plan is essentially a 'professional development' portfolio section.

**Third, Week 8 on professional presence and communication:** Next week we explore how presence enables effectiveness. Many competencies you assessed today (professionalism, communication, influence, empathy) manifest through presence. Bring your development plan—we'll reference it.

**Submission reminder:** Complete self-assessment and development plan due [date] to Moodle. PDF format. I'm evaluating completeness and thoughtfulness, not rating your skills. Questions about submission?"

## Valid Approaches & Variations

### If Students Finish at Very Different Rates

**Challenge:** Some students complete assessments quickly; others need full time.

**Valid approaches:**

1. **Early finishers enhance specificity:**
   - "Review your evidence and development opportunity examples. Add more specific details—what exactly happened? What did you do or say? What was the result?"
   - "Expand your development strategies. For each strategy, add one sentence explaining HOW you'll implement it"

2. **Early finishers begin implementation:**
   - "Choose one development strategy you can start this week. Draft specific action steps—what exactly will you do, when, where?"
   - "Identify who could give you feedback on your priority competency. Draft a request for feedback explaining what you're working on and what observations would help"

3. **Early finishers support peers (carefully):**
   - "If you're finished and a nearby classmate looks stuck, quietly offer to discuss their question"
   - NOTE: Monitor this—ensure it's genuine help, not one student dominating or sharing answers

### If Class Is Struggling with Specific Assessment

**Challenge:** Many students confused about particular framework or competency.

**Valid approaches:**

1. **Pause for group clarification:**
   - "I'm seeing questions about [competency]. Let's pause for 2 minutes to clarify together"
   - Provide clear example, answer questions, then resume individual work
   - Adjust timing to accommodate brief group pause

2. **Offer optional worked example:**
   - "If you're struggling to identify evidence, here's my example for [competency]..." (share your own experience)
   - This models the level of specificity expected

3. **Simplify temporarily, elaborate later:**
   - "If you're stuck, provide brief answers now and add details after tutorial before submission"
   - Keeps students progressing rather than stuck on one item

### If Students Resist Honest Self-Assessment

**Challenge:** Students rating themselves unrealistically high (impression management) or low (self-deprecation).

**Valid approaches:**

1. **Reinforce developmental purpose:**
   - "Remember, I'm grading your thoughtfulness, not your ratings. Accurate self-assessment—whether high or low—is what produces learning"
   - "If you rate everything 3-4 without genuine evidence, you waste this opportunity to identify development priorities"

2. **Prompt for evidence:**
   - "For any rating of 3 or 4, ensure you have specific recent example. If you can't identify concrete situation, reconsider your rating"
   - "For ratings of 1-2, explicitly note the development opportunity—what would stronger capability look like?"

3. **Acknowledge difficulty:**
   - "Self-assessment is hard. We all have blind spots. That's why 360-degree feedback (others rating you) is more accurate. Since we can't do that today, be as honest as possible and consider seeking external feedback on your priority competencies"

## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

### Cross-Cultural Assessment Considerations

1. **Behavioral norms vary by culture:**
   - Some ESCI and CQ items reflect Western cultural norms (e.g., direct communication, individual initiative)
   - Vietnamese students may rate "influence" or "inspirational leadership" low not due to lack of capability but different cultural scripts for leadership (more collective, less individually assertive)
   - ACKNOWLEDGE this: "These frameworks were developed primarily in Western contexts. Some behaviors described may feel culturally unfamiliar. Rate your capability in contexts where you operate—university, work, social groups"

2. **CQ-Knowledge items:**
   - Vietnamese students may have strong ASEAN cultural knowledge but lower Western cultural knowledge
   - International students may have opposite pattern
   - ACKNOWLEDGE: "CQ-Knowledge asks about 'other cultures' generally. You might have strong knowledge of some cultures (ASEAN neighbors, Western countries) but limited knowledge of others (African, Latin American). Rate based on breadth—how many different cultural systems do you understand?"

3. **Self-promotion versus modesty:**
   - Some cultures (including Vietnamese) emphasize modesty, making self-assessment of strengths uncomfortable
   - ACKNOWLEDGE: "Some cultural backgrounds emphasize humility over self-promotion. For this assessment, set aside modesty norms temporarily. Accurate recognition of strengths is not arrogance—it's self-awareness, which is itself an EI competency"

4. **Emotional expression:**
   - ESCI items about "expressing emotions" or "emotional self-control" reflect assumptions about appropriate emotionality
   - Vietnamese cultural norms often value emotional restraint; Western norms increasingly value emotional expression
   - ACKNOWLEDGE: "Rate emotional self-control based on whether you can regulate emotions productively in YOUR cultural contexts, not whether you match Western emotional expression norms"

### International Student Considerations

**For international students in this class:**

1. **CQ assessment may seem redundant:**
   - International students living/studying in Vietnam inherently practice cultural intelligence daily
   - ACKNOWLEDGE: "If you're an international student, you're developing CQ through immersion. Your CQ-Drive and CQ-Action may be high because you practice daily. This assessment makes explicit what you're learning implicitly"

2. **NACE competencies reflect US employer expectations:**
   - May not perfectly match home country norms
   - ACKNOWLEDGE: "NACE is US-based framework. Use it to understand US/international employer expectations, but also research competencies valued in your home country if pursuing career there"

3. **Language considerations:**
   - Behavioral indicators are in English; ESL students may need clarification
   - OFFER: "If any behavioral indicator or competency definition is unclear due to language, please ask—I can explain in simpler English or provide examples"

---

## Anticipated Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Students Treat This as High-Stakes Assessment

**Symptoms:**
- Anxiety about "right answers"
- Competitive comparison with classmates
- Grade-focused questions ("How many competencies do I need to rate as 3+ to get good grade?")

**Solutions:**
- Reiterate grading criteria explicitly: "You're graded on completeness and thoughtfulness, NOT on your ratings. Someone who honestly rates mostly 1-2 and provides specific development plans gets the same grade as someone rating mostly 3-4 with equally thoughtful plans"
- Discourage comparison: "Don't share your numeric ratings with classmates. Your profile is personal—comparing creates unhelpful competition"
- Redirect to developmental purpose: "The value of this tutorial is identifying YOUR development priorities for YOUR career goals. Gaming the assessment only cheats yourself of development opportunity"

### Challenge 2: Students Can't Identify Specific Examples

**Symptoms:**
- Generic statements: "I demonstrated teamwork in group projects"
- Blank "evidence" sections
- Requests for "acceptable examples"

**Solutions:**
- Provide prompting structure: "Describe one specific team project. What did you specifically do that showed teamwork? What was the result?"
- Offer example frameworks:
  - "For communication: Think of a time you explained something complex. To whom? What was the challenge? How did you adapt your message? How did they respond?"
  - "For adaptability: Think of a time plans changed suddenly. What was your initial plan? What disrupted it? How did you adjust? What was the outcome?"
- If genuinely no examples: "If you can't recall any situations for a competency, that's valuable information. It means you've had limited practice, making it a clear development priority. Note 'Limited practice—need to seek opportunities' in your assessment"

### Challenge 3: Students Want to Develop ALL Competencies

**Symptoms:**
- Listing 5+ priority competencies
- Vague strategies applied to many areas
- Anxiety about "neglecting" low-rated competencies

**Solutions:**
- Explain research on focused practice: "Research on skill development shows focused effort on 2-3 capabilities produces better results than diffused effort across many. You can't meaningfully develop 8 competencies simultaneously"
- Frame as prioritization skill: "Part of professionalism (a NACE competency!) is prioritizing effectively. Choosing 2-3 priorities demonstrates strategic thinking"
- Suggest sequential development: "After developing your priority competencies this semester, you can select new priorities next semester. This is ongoing career-long process, not one-time fix"
- Acknowledge foundations: "If truly everything needs work, start with foundational competencies: self-awareness (enables other EI domains), critical thinking (enables many NACE competencies), CQ-Drive (enables other CQ factors). Building foundations makes later development easier"

### Challenge 4: Development Strategies Too Vague

**Symptoms:**
- Strategies like "practice more," "try harder," "be more confident"
- No specific practice opportunities identified
- Generic goals without behavioral targets

**Solutions:**
- Require behavioral specificity: "Translate 'practice empathy' into specific behaviors: 'Paraphrase others' points before responding; ask clarifying questions; observe nonverbal cues; provide support when noticed.' That's a development strategy"
- Connect to behavioral indicators: "Look back at the behavioral indicators for your priority competency. Which specific indicator will you target first? That becomes your development strategy"
- Ensure practice context: "For each strategy, identify WHERE and WHEN you'll practice this semester. 'Group project meetings Tuesdays' is concrete. 'Whenever opportunity arises' is too vague"
- Provide examples if needed:
  - Emotional self-control: "When feeling frustrated in meetings, take 3 deep breaths before responding; journal about emotional triggers after stressful days; practice 10-minute daily meditation"
  - Influence: "Before making requests, prepare 2-3 reasons aligned with others' interests; observe successful influencers' tactics; practice framing proposals to appeal to audience priorities"
  - CQ-Action: "Record yourself in presentation; review to identify verbal/nonverbal habits; practice 3 different formality levels for same message; request feedback from international students on cultural appropriateness"

## Connection to Course Assessments

### Assessment 3: Self-Portrait Video

**How today's tutorial supports Assessment 3:**

Students create 2-minute video showcasing strength OR explaining development challenge. Today's self-assessment provides:

1. **Evidence for strength showcase:**
   - High-rated NACE/ESCI competencies with strong examples = potential strengths to highlight
   - Specific behavioral indicators = language for articulating the strength
   - Recent examples from assessment = stories for video

2. **Framework for development explanation:**
   - Low-rated competencies with development plans = potential challenges to explain
   - Gap analysis = understanding of why this competency matters
   - Development strategies = demonstration of growth mindset and proactive development

**Guidance to provide:**
"Many students will reference transferable skills or EI competencies in Assessment 3. Today's work gives you the analysis to do this effectively. If showcasing a strength: use your high-rated competencies and specific examples. If explaining development: use your low-rated competencies and thoughtful development plans. Either approach works—the key is self-awareness and evidence."

### Assessment 5: Professional Portfolio

**How today's tutorial supports Assessment 5:**

Professional portfolios require articulating competencies clearly. Today's assessment develops:

1. **Competency language:**
   - NACE framework provides employer-recognized competency categories
   - ESCI provides specific behavioral language
   - Practice translating self-awareness into professional communication

2. **Evidence collection:**
   - Examples identified today = starting point for portfolio evidence
   - Development plans = professional development section content

3. **Continuous documentation:**
   - "Start documenting evidence NOW. When you demonstrate a competency, record it immediately. By semester end, you'll have rich portfolio content rather than scrambling to remember examples"

**Guidance to provide:**
"Professional portfolios require competency demonstration. Today you identified your competencies and evidence. Continue documenting as you progress. When you successfully demonstrate a competency—give presentation, resolve conflict, adapt to change—record it briefly. This ongoing documentation makes portfolio development much easier."

## Tutor Self-Reflection Questions

**After tutorial, consider:**

1. **Pacing:** Did students have adequate time for thoughtful assessment? Did some finish much earlier or later than expected?

2. **Engagement:** Did students engage seriously with self-assessment or treat it superficially? What caused differences?

3. **Clarification needs:** Which competencies or frameworks required most explanation? How can lecture or materials be improved?

4. **Cultural sensitivity:** Did you notice cultural factors affecting students' self-assessment? How did you address these?

5. **Specificity:** Did students' development plans include specific strategies and practice opportunities, or remain vague? What prompting was most effective?

6. **Assessment connections:** Did students understand how this tutorial supports Assessments 3 and 5?
