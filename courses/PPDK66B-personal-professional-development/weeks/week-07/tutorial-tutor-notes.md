## Tutorial Facilitation Guide

### Opening (0-5 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Set serious, focused tone (this is high-stakes work)
- Clarify deliverable expectations
- Connect to assessment value (PDP Part 2 = 15%, feeds into Part 3 = 30%)

**Script:**

> "Welcome to Week 7 tutorial. Today is one of the most important sessions of the semester because you're building the strategic core of your Personal Development Plan — your Skills Gap Analysis.
>
> By the end of today, you will have identified 8-10 critical skills for your career, honestly assessed your current level, set development targets, and created specific action plans. This work is worth 15% of your final grade as part of PDP Part 2, and it feeds directly into your goals in Part 3, which is another 30%.
>
> You'll also be sharing this draft with your mentor in Meeting #3. Mentors expect to see thoughtful, specific skills analysis — not vague intentions.
>
> This tutorial requires focus and honesty. Self-assessment is hard. It requires confronting gaps between where you are and where you need to be. That's uncomfortable but essential for growth.
>
> Let's get to work."

**Pulse Check:**
- "Quick show of hands: Who completed the Week 7 readings?"
- "Who has Meeting #3 with their mentor already scheduled?"
- "Any questions from the lecture before we dive in?"

**Logistics:**
- Point out materials (handouts, templates, reference guides)
- Show timer: "We have 90 minutes. I'll keep us on track."
- Submission reminder: "You'll upload Skills Gap Analysis before leaving today."

### Activity 1: EI Self-Assessment (5-25 minutes)

**Objective:** Students self-rate on Boyatzis' 12 EI competencies with behavioral evidence

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to Do:**
- Distribute Boyatzis ESCI handout
- Project rating scale on screen (1-5 definitions)
- Emphasize: "This is FOR you. Honest assessment is more valuable than inflated scores."

**What to Say:**

> "You're going to self-assess on 12 emotional intelligence competencies. For each one, you'll rate yourself 1-5 AND provide behavioral evidence — specific examples from your life that justify the rating.
>
> The behavioral evidence is critical. Don't just guess. Think: What have I actually DONE that demonstrates this competency level?"

#### During Activity (20 minutes)

**Your Role: Circulate & Coach**

**Watch For:**

**Problem #1: Speed Without Reflection**
- Student racing through ratings without behavioral evidence
- **Intervention:** "I see you're moving quickly. Tell me the behavioral evidence for your Empathy rating of 4. What specific examples support that?"

**Problem #2: All Ratings = 3 (Avoiding Extremes)**
- Student rates everything "average" to play it safe
- **Intervention:** "You've rated 7 competencies as 3. Are you truly average at everything? Which are genuinely stronger? Which need real work? Differentiation helps you prioritize development."

**Problem #3: Overestimation (Especially Emotional Self-Control)**
- Student rates themselves 4-5 on competency they clearly struggle with
- **Intervention:** "You rated Emotional Self-Control as 4. Tell me about a recent time when you felt strong emotions. How did you handle it? Would others who were there rate you as 4?"
- Gently prompt Johari Window: "Sometimes we have blind spots. Consider asking a friend for feedback on this one."

**Problem #4: No Behavioral Evidence (Just Feelings)**
- Student writes: "I think I'm empathetic" without examples
- **Intervention:** "What you THINK isn't evidence. Give me a specific situation. When have you demonstrated empathy? What did you do? What was the impact?"

**Problem #5: Comparing to Others (Wrong Baseline)**
- Student: "I rated Leadership as 5 because I'm better than my roommate"
- **Intervention:** "Don't compare to peers. Use the scale definition. Rating 5 means 'exceptional, recognized by others, teach/coach regularly.' Does that describe you?"

**Coaching Questions to Ask:**

For students stuck on rating:
- "Tell me about a recent situation involving this competency."
- "How did you handle it?"
- "What would success have looked like? How close were you?"
- "If I asked 3 people who know you, what would they say?"

For students who finish quickly (under 10 min):
- Check for depth: "Show me your behavioral evidence for your top strength and biggest weakness."
- If shallow, send back: "I need specific examples, not generalizations."

**Time Warnings:**
- 10 min: "You should be halfway through (6 competencies)."
- 15 min: "Wrapping up last few competencies now."
- 18 min: "Finish your current competency and identify top 3 strengths/development needs."

#### Transition to Activity 2 (1 minute)

**What to Say:**

> "You've assessed emotional intelligence. Now we expand to other transferable skills frameworks. Some will overlap — that's fine. We'll consolidate in Activity 3."

---

### Activity 2: Transferable Skills Inventory (25-40 minutes)

**Objective:** Students rate themselves on WEF and NACE skills

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to Do:**
- Distribute WEF and NACE handouts
- Project both frameworks side-by-side
- Point out overlaps: "Empathy appears in both WEF and Boyatzis — use same rating."

**What to Say:**

> "You'll now rate yourself on WEF's Top 10 skills and NACE's 8 competencies. This will feel repetitive — some skills overlap with EI. That's intentional. We're gathering comprehensive data before you select your focus areas.
>
> Move faster here than Activity 1. You don't need as much behavioral evidence for each — but still be honest."

#### During Activity (12 minutes)

**Your Role: Keep Pace, Answer Clarifications**

**Common Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "What's the difference between WEF Analytical Thinking and NACE Critical Thinking?"**
A: "Very similar. Analytical thinking = breaking down complex info, finding patterns. Critical thinking = evaluating information quality, making sound judgments. Rate yourself similarly on both unless you see a real difference."

**Q: "How do I rate Talent Management as a student? I don't manage anyone."**
A: "Think of it as developing others. Have you mentored younger students? Taught friends a skill? Helped team members improve? That's talent management."

**Q: "I've never thought about Organizational Awareness. I don't work in an organization."**
A: "You're in several: university, student clubs, maybe part-time job, even family. Do you understand power dynamics? Who really influences decisions? How to navigate politics? That's organizational awareness."

**Q: "Equity & Inclusion feels political. What does it really mean?"**
A: "It means working effectively with people from different backgrounds — gender, culture, age, nationality, socioeconomic status. Do you seek diverse perspectives? Challenge biases? Create inclusive environments? Rate that."

**Watch For:**

**Problem: Student Overwhelmed by Number of Skills**
- Signs: Staring blankly, visibly anxious, not writing
- **Intervention:** "I know this feels like a lot. You're not developing all these skills — just taking inventory. In Activity 3, you'll choose 8-10 to focus on. For now, just rate honestly and move on."

**Problem: Inconsistent Ratings Across Similar Skills**
- Example: Student rates Empathy (Boyatzis) = 4, but Empathy & Active Listening (WEF) = 2
- **Intervention:** "I notice you rated Empathy differently in WEF vs. Boyatzis. Are these really different for you, or should they align?"

**Problem: Rating Everything 4-5 (Overconfidence)**
- **Intervention:** "You've rated 8 out of 10 WEF skills as 4 or 5. If you're exceptional at 80% of critical skills, why do you need this course? Be more discerning — where are genuine gaps?"

**Time Warnings:**
- 6 min: "Finish WEF Top 10, move to NACE."
- 10 min: "Wrapping up NACE now."
- 12 min: "Cultural Intelligence quick assessment if time, otherwise move to Activity 3."

#### Optional: Cultural Intelligence Quick Assessment (2 minutes)

If students finish early:
- Have them rate 4 CQ dimensions (1-5)
- Especially valuable for students targeting international careers or multinational companies

#### Transition to Activity 3 (1 minute)

**What to Say:**

> "You now have comprehensive self-assessment data: 12 EI competencies, 10 WEF skills, 8 NACE competencies, maybe 4 CQ dimensions. That's 30+ data points about yourself.
>
> Obviously, you can't focus on 30 skills. Activity 3 is where strategy comes in: Choosing the RIGHT 8-10 skills to develop for YOUR career."

---

### Activity 3: Skills Gap Analysis Creation (40-70 minutes)

**Objective:** Students create actionable, specific skills gap analysis for PDP Part 2

This is the **CORE DELIVERABLE** of today's tutorial. Invest your time here.

#### Setup (2 minutes)

**What to Do:**
- Distribute blank Skills Gap Analysis template
- Project exemplar completed rows on screen
- Emphasize specificity: "Vague strategies won't help you. Specific actions will."

**What to Say:**

> "This is your main deliverable today. You're creating a Skills Gap Analysis table for 8-10 skills that matter most for YOUR career.
>
> This table will be in your PDP Part 2, worth 15% of your grade. Your mentor will review it in Meeting #3. Most importantly, this is YOUR ROADMAP for development over the next 1-3 years.
>
> I'm going to be demanding about specificity. 'Practice more' is not a development strategy. 'Join Toastmasters September 2025, present in 3 classes per semester, record and review weekly, attend workshop January 2026' IS a strategy.
>
> You have 30 minutes. Let's work."

#### Step 1: Skill Selection (5 minutes)

**Circulate and Coach:**

**Watch For:**

**Problem: All Transferable Skills, No Technical Skills**
- Student selects: Communication, Teamwork, Leadership, Empathy, Critical Thinking, Creativity, Adaptability, Self-Awareness
- **Intervention:** "These are all soft skills. What TECHNICAL skills do job descriptions in your field require? Data analytics? Design software? Financial modeling? Programming? You need hard skills too."

**Problem: All Technical Skills, No Transferable Skills**
- Student selects: Excel, PowerPoint, Python, SQL, Photoshop, Accounting, SEO, Google Analytics
- **Intervention:** "Technical skills are necessary but not sufficient. Employers hire for skills, fire for lack of EI and teamwork. Add 3-4 transferable skills, especially from your weaknesses."

**Problem: No AI-Era Skills**
- **Intervention:** "By 2030, you'll work alongside AI daily. How will you add value? Context engineering? Judgment? Creative problem-solving? Human empathy? Include 2-3 AI-era skills."

**Problem: Generic Skills, Not Specific**
- Student lists: "Communication"
- **Intervention:** "Communication is too broad. Be specific: Public speaking? Written communication? Cross-cultural communication? Active listening? Persuasive writing? Choose one specific type."

**Helpful Prompts:**

For students stuck on selection:
- "Pull up 3-5 job descriptions for roles you want. What skills appear repeatedly?"
- "Ask yourself: If I developed these 8 skills excellently, would I be competitive for my target career? If not, what's missing?"
- "Look at your WEF/NACE/EI assessments. Which LOW ratings are most career-critical?"

#### Step 2: Complete Skills Gap Analysis Table (20 minutes)

**Circulate Intensively — This is Where Quality is Made or Lost**

**Focus Areas:**

**1. Development Strategies (Most Critical Column)**

This is where students struggle most. They write vague intentions, not actionable plans.

**Bad Examples:**
- "Practice public speaking"
- "Get better at data analysis"
- "Work on empathy"
- "Improve leadership skills"

**Good Examples:**
- "Join NEU Toastmasters (Sept 2025), present in 3 classes/semester, record presentations and review weekly with mentor feedback, attend 2-day public speaking workshop (Jan 2026), practice 10 min daily using TED talk structures"
- "Complete Google Analytics certification (Oct 2025), take NEU Data Analytics course (Fall 2025), analyze 3 real business datasets (Nov-Dec 2025), create monthly analytics dashboards for student organization, meet with data analyst mentor quarterly for feedback"
- "Practice active listening in 3 conversations daily, paraphrase before responding, ask open questions instead of giving immediate advice, read 'Dare to Lead' by Brené Brown (Sept 2025), volunteer 4 hrs/month in customer service role to practice empathy with strangers"

**Coaching Script for Vague Strategies:**

> "You wrote 'practice public speaking.' Let's make this specific using deliberate practice principles:
> - WHAT specifically will you practice? (e.g., 10-min presentations, Q&A handling, storytelling techniques)
> - WHEN? (daily? weekly? specific times in calendar?)
> - WHERE? (Toastmasters? class? recorded practice at home?)
> - WITH WHOM? (peer feedback? mentor? self-review?)
> - USING WHAT RESOURCES? (courses? workshops? books? apps?)
> - HOW OFTEN? (consistency principle)
> - Rewrite it with those details."

**Use Deliberate Practice Prompting Questions:**
1. "What's your specific goal for this practice session?"
2. "How will you get immediate feedback?"
3. "What weakness are you focusing on?"
4. "How will you vary the practice?"
5. "How will you maintain consistency?"

**2. Success Metrics (Second Most Critical)**

Students often write vague metrics or skip this column.

**Bad Examples:**
- "I'll feel more confident"
- "I'll be better"
- "Improved performance"

**Good Examples:**
- "Behavioral: I speak without reading slides, maintain eye contact 80% of time, handle 5 Q&A questions confidently. Feedback: 3 peers say 'you've improved significantly,' professor rates presentation 85+. Performance: Successfully present PDP in final oral exam with 80+ score. Self-assessment: Rate myself 4 on public speaking."

**Coaching Script:**

> "How will you KNOW you've improved? Give me three types of evidence:
> 1. Behavioral: What will you DO differently that's observable?
> 2. Feedback: What will OTHERS say about your improvement?
> 3. Performance: What measurable outcome will you achieve?
> Write all three."

**3. Realistic Targets (Common Overestimation)**

**Problem: Current Level 1 → Target Level 5 in 1 year**
- **Intervention:** "Level 5 is expert — teaching others, recognized widely. Even with intensive practice, 1→3 or 1→4 in one year is more realistic. Save 5 for your 3-year target."

**Problem: Target Level = 5 for Every Skill**
- **Intervention:** "Not every skill needs expert level. Strategic choices matter. Which 2-3 skills are TRUE differentiators for your career? Make those 5. Others can be 3-4 (competent/proficient)."

**Rule of Thumb:**
- 1 level improvement = 3-6 months of deliberate practice
- 2 levels in 1 year = aggressive but achievable with focus
- 3+ levels in 1 year = unrealistic unless starting from complete beginner

**4. Priority Assessment**

**Problem: Everything is High Priority**
- **Intervention:** "If everything is high priority, nothing is. You can't focus on 10 skills intensively. Choose 3-4 HIGH priority (work on this year), 3-4 MEDIUM (gradual improvement), 2 LOW (maintain or slow growth)."

**Priority Criteria (Remind Students):**
- High = Large gap + Essential for career + Achievable in timeframe
- Medium = Moderate gap OR moderate career importance
- Low = Small gap OR lower immediate impact

**Time Warnings:**
- 10 min: "You should have 3-4 skills completely done."
- 15 min: "You should have 6+ skills done."
- 20 min: "Finish your last 2-3 skills now. Focus on High priority skills if running short on time."

#### Step 3: Validation (5 minutes)

**What to Say:**

> "Before we move on, validate your work:
> 1. Do you have 8-10 skills selected? Mix of technical, transferable, AI-era?
> 2. Are development strategies SPECIFIC? Could someone else follow your plan?
> 3. Are success metrics OBSERVABLE? Behavioral + Feedback + Performance?
> 4. Are targets REALISTIC? Max +2 levels in 1 year for most skills?
> 5. Are priorities DIFFERENTIATED? 3-4 High, 3-4 Medium, 2 Low?
>
> Turn to the person next to you. Read your top High priority skill aloud. Ask them: 'Is my development strategy specific enough? Can you picture exactly what I'll do?'
>
> If they say 'I'm not sure,' revise it."

**Circulate During Peer Validation:**
- Listen to conversations
- Jump in if both students have weak strategies: "Let me model a strong strategy for you..."

#### Common Challenges & Interventions

**Challenge 1: "I don't know what resources are available"**

**Response:**
- "Start with what you DO know exists: NEU courses, student clubs, free online courses (Coursera, edX), YouTube tutorials, library books."
- "In Meeting #3, ask your mentor: 'What resources do you recommend for developing [skill]?'"
- "Part of self-managed learning is FINDING resources. That's a skill itself."

**Challenge 2: "I don't have time to develop all these skills"**

**Response:**
- "Exactly why you prioritize. Focus on 3-4 HIGH priority skills this year."
- "Next week (Week 8) we cover time and energy management. You'll learn to CREATE time through Deep Work and habit stacking."
- "Small consistent practice (15 min daily) beats infrequent intense practice (3 hours monthly)."

**Challenge 3: "What if I choose wrong skills?"**

**Response:**
- "Your PDP is a living document. You'll revise it annually throughout your career."
- "That's why Meeting #3 with your mentor is crucial — they'll tell you if you're off-track."
- "Better to start with imperfect plan and adjust than to wait for perfect plan that never comes."

**Challenge 4: "Technical skills seem easier to measure than soft skills"**

**Response:**
- "True, but soft skills can be measured behaviorally. Example: Empathy measured by 'paraphrases before responding in 80% of conversations' or 'peers report feeling heard.'"
- "Use the Boyatzis behavioral indicators — those are observable actions."

#### Transition to Activity 4 (1 minute)

**What to Say:**

> "You've done the hard analytical work of creating your skills gap analysis. Now let's add external perspective. You'll get peer feedback on one interpersonal skill — and practice giving feedback, which is itself an EI skill."

---

### Activity 4: Peer Feedback Exchange (70-85 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice giving/receiving feedback; validate self-assessments

#### Setup (2 minutes)

**What to Do:**
- Pair students (ideally with classmates they've worked with before)
- Project SBI Feedback Model on screen
- Set serious but supportive tone

**What to Say:**

> "This activity develops TWO emotional intelligence competencies simultaneously:
> 1. Receiving feedback gracefully (Self-Management)
> 2. Giving constructive feedback effectively (Relationship Management / Coach & Mentor)
>
> You'll practice the SBI model: Situation, Behavior, Impact. This is how professionals give feedback in the workplace.
>
> **Critical rules:**
> - Receivers: Listen without defending, explaining, or justifying. Just say 'thank you.'
> - Givers: Be specific and constructive. Focus on behavior, not personality.
> - Both: This is practice in a safe environment. Be honest but kind."

**Model SBI Feedback (1 minute):**

Project example:

**Weak Feedback:** "You're not a good listener."

**Strong SBI Feedback:**
"**Situation:** In our field trip debrief last week,
**Behavior:** I noticed you checked your phone twice while others were sharing reflections,
**Impact:** which made it seem like you weren't engaged with what they were saying.
**Suggestion:** I'd encourage you to put devices away during group discussions to show active listening."

#### During Activity (10 minutes)

**Your Role: Monitor Quality of Feedback**

**Circulate and Listen:**

**Green Flags (Good Feedback):**
- Using SBI structure
- Specific examples with context
- Balancing strength + growth area
- Constructive tone
- Receiver listening without defensiveness

**Red Flags (Intervene Immediately):**
- **Too harsh/personal:** "You're just not empathetic" → STOP. "Let's rephrase behaviorally: 'In X situation, I noticed you did Y, which had Z impact...'"
- **Too vague:** "You should improve communication" → PROMPT. "What specific communication behavior? Give an example."
- **Only positive (avoiding growth area):** → PROMPT. "Now share one area for growth. Remember, growth feedback is a gift, not an insult."
- **Receiver becoming defensive:** → INTERVENE. "Pause. Your job right now is to listen, not agree or disagree. Take notes, say thank you, reflect later."

**Coaching Interventions:**

If giver is struggling:
- "Think of a specific situation you observed."
- "What exactly did they DO? (behavior)"
- "What effect did that have? (impact)"
- "What would you encourage them to try instead?"

If receiver is defensive:
- "I see you're explaining yourself. That's natural but defeats the purpose. Can you just listen and say 'thank you for that feedback'?"

#### Reflection (3 minutes)

**What to Say:**

> "Take 2 minutes to write individually:
> - What did you learn about yourself from this feedback?
> - Did it align with your self-assessment? If not, why the gap?
> - How will you integrate this into your Skills Gap Analysis?
> - How did it FEEL to give/receive feedback? (EI self-awareness question)"

**Debrief (2 minutes):**

> "Raise your hand if the feedback you received was different from your self-assessment."
>
> [Multiple hands should go up]
>
> "This is the Johari Window from Week 5. Others see things we don't see about ourselves. This is valuable data. Will anyone adjust their Skills Gap Analysis based on this feedback?"

**Connection to Career:**

> "In professional settings, you'll receive feedback constantly — from managers, peers, clients. Your ability to receive it gracefully and use it for growth is HIGH emotional intelligence. You just practiced that."

#### Transition to Activity 5 (1 minute)

**What to Say:**

> "Final step: Compile everything into PDP Part 2 format and prepare for your mentor meeting."

---

### Activity 5: PDP Part 2 Draft & Closing (85-90 minutes)

**Objective:** Finalize deliverable and prepare for Mentorship Meeting #3

#### SWOT Quick Draft (2 minutes)

**What to Do:**
- Guide students through fast SWOT creation using today's data
- This should be quick — they have all the inputs already

**Prompt:**

> "Using your self-assessments from today:
> - **Strengths:** Skills you rated 4-5
> - **Weaknesses:** Skills you rated 1-2
> - **Opportunities:** Growing skill demands, available resources, mentor expertise
> - **Threats:** Obsolescence, competition, barriers
>
> Write 5-7 items per quadrant. Go."

**Circulate Quickly:**
- Check that students are using self-assessment data, not inventing new info
- Ensure SWOT has external factors (Opportunities/Threats), not just internal

#### Compile PDP Part 2 Components (1 minute)

**Checklist on Screen:**

- [ ] SWOT Analysis (5-7 items per quadrant)
- [ ] Skills Gap Analysis table (8-10 skills)
- [ ] Reflection on EI assessment results
- [ ] Peer feedback notes

**What to Say:**

> "Before you submit, verify you have all components. Your PDP Part 2 includes both SWOT and Skills Gap Analysis."

#### Prepare for Mentorship Meeting #3 (1 minute)

**Project Questions to Ask Mentor:**

> "Bring these questions to Meeting #3:
> 1. 'I've identified [X, Y, Z] as top priorities. Do these align with what's valued in [industry]?'
> 2. 'How did you develop [specific skill]? What worked?'
> 3. 'Are my self-assessments realistic, or am I over/underestimating?'
> 4. 'Can you help me practice [skill] in our meetings?'
> 5. 'What resources or opportunities do you recommend?'"

#### Submission & Final Reminders (1 minute)

**What to Do:**
- Monitor real-time submissions
- Check file naming conventions
- Confirm students who haven't submitted yet

**What to Say:**

> "Upload your Skills Gap Analysis to the course system now. File name: StudentNumber_Name_SkillsGapAnalysis_Week7.
>
> **Reminder:** This is a DRAFT. You'll revise based on mentor feedback in Meeting #3. But I need to see your work today to confirm you're on track.
>
> **Mentorship Meeting #3 deadline:** Weeks 7-8. If you haven't scheduled yet, do it TODAY.
>
> **Next week:** Time, Energy & Habit Management. You've identified WHAT to develop. Next week: HOW to make time for development in busy life."

#### Closing Motivation (1 minute)

**What to Say:**

> "You've done serious strategic work today. This isn't busy work — this is the roadmap for your next 1-3 years of professional development.
>
> The difference between people who have careers and people who build careers is this: intentional skill development. You now have your plan. Your job is to execute it with deliberate practice.
>
> Questions before we close?"

**Final Q&A:**

Be prepared for:
- "What if I want to change skills after talking to my mentor?"
  - "Revise it. Your PDP evolves. Just document the change and reasoning."
- "Do I need mentor approval?"
  - "Not approval — input. They'll tell you if you're off-track."
- "Can I add more than 10 skills?"
  - "You CAN, but shouldn't intensively develop more than 3-4 at once. Additional skills can be 'maintaining' or 'monitoring.'"

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Student Challenges & Solutions

#### "I'm overwhelmed by too many skill gaps"

**Root Cause:** Perfectionism, lack of prioritization

**Response:**
"That's normal — most people have more gaps than they can address at once. That's why we prioritize. Focus on 3-4 HIGH priority skills this year. Others can wait or develop slowly. You'll revisit this plan annually throughout your career."

**Follow-Up:**
"Which 3 skills would make the BIGGEST difference in your career if you developed them excellently this year? Start there."

#### "I don't know how to rate myself accurately"

**Root Cause:** Lack of calibration, fear of being wrong

**Response:**
"Use behavioral evidence, not gut feeling. Look at the rating scale definitions. What have you actually DONE that demonstrates each level?

Also, ask others. Your mentor, peers, professors — they see things you don't (Johari Window). This week's peer feedback started that process."

**Follow-Up:**
"In Meeting #3, ask your mentor: 'I rated myself [X] on [skill]. Does that seem accurate based on what you know about me?'"

#### "My development strategies feel vague"

**Root Cause:** Lack of specificity training, unfamiliarity with resources

**Response:**
"Use the deliberate practice questions:
1. WHAT specifically will you practice?
2. WHEN? (frequency, timing)
3. WHERE? (context)
4. WITH WHOM? (feedback source)
5. USING WHAT RESOURCES?

Rewrite your strategy answering all 5."

**Follow-Up:**
Show exemplar strategy, then have student rewrite theirs side-by-side.

#### "I don't have time to develop skills while being a full-time student"

**Root Cause:** All-or-nothing thinking, time management issues

**Response:**
"Next week we cover time and energy management. You'll learn to make time through Deep Work principles and habit stacking.

Also, remember: 15 minutes daily = 105 minutes weekly. Consistency beats intensity. You're not adding extra activities — you're being intentional about activities you already do."

**Examples:**
- Practice active listening in conversations you're already having
- Apply analytical thinking to assignments you're already completing
- Develop professionalism in clubs you're already attending

#### "What if I pick the wrong skills to develop?"

**Root Cause:** Fear of mistakes, perfectionism

**Response:**
"Your PDP isn't carved in stone. It's a living document you'll revise.

More importantly, developing ANY skill using deliberate practice makes you better at learning itself (metacognition). Even if you later switch focus, you've built the HABIT of intentional development — that's the most valuable skill.

Talk to your mentor in Meeting #3. They'll tell you if you're way off-track."

#### "Technical skills are easier for me than soft skills"

**Root Cause:** True for many students; different development approaches needed

**Response:**
"Technical skills have clear tutorials, courses, measurable outputs — easier to practice deliberately.

Soft skills require different approach: real-world practice with feedback. Example: Can't develop empathy from a textbook — need to practice in conversations, get feedback from others, reflect on impact.

Use your mentorship for soft skills practice. Ask mentor: 'Can we role-play a difficult conversation so I can practice conflict management?'"

**Remember:** Your role is to coach intentional development, not to be directive. Students must own their plans. Guide them to specificity, realism, and strategic thinking — but let them choose their focus areas.

This tutorial builds the foundation for students' lifelong professional development. Take it seriously. Invest your time. Be demanding about quality. Their careers depend on these skills.
