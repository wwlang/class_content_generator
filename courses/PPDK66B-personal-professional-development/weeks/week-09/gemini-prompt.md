# Yet

**The single word that separates those who grow from those who stagnate**

"I can't do this" → Fixed Mindset
"I can't do this *yet*" → Growth Mindset

<speaker-notes>
Imagine two students receive the same grade—a C+. Not failing, but not what they hoped for. Student A thinks: "I'm not good at this subject. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this career." Student B thinks: "I haven't mastered this yet. I need to change my strategy." Which student is more likely to succeed in the long term? The difference isn't intelligence or talent—it's mindset. This distinction shapes how you respond to challenges, seek feedback, and handle setbacks. Today we're going deep into mindset research—the real science, not the oversimplified version.

**[VIDEO: Carol Dweck - "The Power of Believing That You Can Improve"]**

**Video link:** https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve

**Duration:** 10 minutes

**Before watching:** "Think of a time you felt 'stuck' at something. What did you tell yourself?"

<speaker-notes>
We're about to hear from Carol Dweck, the Stanford psychologist who pioneered this research over four decades. Pre-viewing question: "Think of a time you felt 'stuck' at something." Watch for the difference between how fixed vs. growth mindset students respond to challenge. After the video, we'll debrief: "What stood out to you?" and "Can you think of a time when you demonstrated fixed vs. growth mindset?"

# SECTION 1

## Growth vs. Fixed Mindset
### The Research Foundation

*(25 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Let's unpack what Dweck's four decades of research actually tells us about how mindsets shape behavior, goals, and career trajectories.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="content" title="Defining Mindsets">
## What Are Mindsets?

**A mindset is your self-theory about human abilities:**

**Fixed Mindset:**
- Abilities are innate and unchangeable
- You're born with a certain amount of talent
- Intelligence is a fixed quantity

**Growth Mindset:**
- Abilities are developable through effort and learning
- You can cultivate skills through practice
- Intelligence is expandable through strategic effort

**Critical clarification:** You're not "a fixed mindset person" — everyone has a mixture.

<speaker-notes>
Carol Dweck defines mindset as a self-theory about the nature of human abilities. Fixed mindset = abilities are static traits you're born with. Growth mindset = abilities are muscles you can develop. Important nuance: Mindsets aren't personality types—everyone has a mixture. You might have growth mindset about public speaking but fixed mindset about math. The key question: Which mindset dominates in areas critical to your career?
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="content" title="The Meaning System">
## How Mindsets Shape Behavior

| **Fixed Mindset** | **Growth Mindset** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "My abilities are fixed" | "My abilities can develop" |
| Performance goals: *Look smart* | Learning goals: *Master skills* |
| "Effort = I'm not talented" | "Effort = path to mastery" |
| Avoid challenges | Embrace challenges |
| Give up after failure | Persist with new strategies |
| Avoid feedback | Seek feedback |
| Threatened by others' success | Inspired by others' success |

<speaker-notes>
Mindsets don't just affect what you believe—they create entire behavioral patterns. Goals: Performance vs. learning orientation. Effort: Threat to self-image vs. path to growth. Challenges: Avoid vs. embrace. Failure: Give up vs. adjust strategy. Feedback: Defensive vs. curious. Others' success: Threatened vs. inspired. Turn and talk for 3 minutes: "Think of a specific skill where you've had a fixed mindset. How did it affect your behavior when you encountered difficulty?"
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="content" title="The Evidence - National Study">
## The National Study of Learning Mindsets

*(Dweck & Yeager, 2019)*

**The largest-ever growth mindset study:**
- **Sample:** 12,000+ 9th graders across 65 U.S. high schools
- **Intervention:** Single 45-minute online session
- **Teaching:** "Intelligence is developable"

**Results:**
- Lower-achieving students improved grades (equivalent: B- to B+)
- Increased enrollment in advanced courses
- Effects persisted over time
- Independently verified by third-party evaluators

**Key insight:** A short intervention changed behavior because it changed beliefs.

<speaker-notes>
Let's look at the evidence. This is the most rigorous study of growth mindset interventions. Just 45 minutes of teaching that abilities are developable changed student behavior. Effects were especially strong for lower-achieving students. This wasn't years of therapy—it was changing a core belief. Why this matters for your career: If a 45-minute intervention can shift grades, imagine what intentional mindset work can do for your career over years.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="content" title="Career-Relevant Findings">
## What Mindset Predicts Across 74 Nations

**Research shows growth mindset predicts:**

1. **Challenge-seeking** — Pursuing stretch assignments over comfort zones

2. **Persistence after setbacks** — Resilience when facing rejection or failure

3. **Learning orientation** — Seeking feedback and continuous skill development

4. **Career advancement** — Faster promotion rates among professionals

**Connection to Week 1:**
- 40% of job skills will change by 2030
- **Growth mindset isn't optional—it's essential for career survival**

<speaker-notes>
Mindset research spans 74 nations. Here's what it consistently predicts. Challenge-seeking: Growth mindset professionals volunteer for difficult projects. Persistence: They recover faster from job rejections and failed projects. Learning orientation: They actively seek feedback, not just validation. Career advancement: These behaviors compound into faster career growth. Connection to Week 1: Remember the WEF report? 40% of skills will change. If you believe skills are fixed, what happens when your industry changes? You're stuck. If you believe you can learn and adapt, technological change becomes opportunity, not threat.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="The Neuroscience Foundation">
## Neuroplasticity: The Brain as a Muscle

**Why growth mindset interventions work: neuroscience supports them**

**Neuroplasticity** = the brain's ability to reorganize and strengthen neural connections through experience

**Key findings:**
- Learning physically changes brain structure
- Myelin increases with practice (signals travel faster)
- Challenge and struggle drive neural growth
- Mistakes signal the brain where to focus resources

**Age doesn't eliminate plasticity:**
- Adult brains remain capable of significant change
- Reskilling mid-career is neurologically possible

<speaker-notes>
Growth mindset isn't just positive thinking—it's supported by neuroscience. When you practice a skill, neural pathways literally strengthen. The "brain as muscle" metaphor is scientifically accurate. Struggle and difficulty drive growth—easy learning produces weak connections. When you struggle with a difficult concept, your brain is literally forming new connections. The struggle isn't failure—it's the mechanism of growth. This is why 'easy A' classes don't develop you as much as challenging courses where you have to work hard.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="11" layout="section-break" title="Section 2: False Growth Mindset">
# SECTION 2

## False Growth Mindset
### What It Actually Requires

*(20 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Now here's where it gets nuanced. Growth mindset has been widely misapplied. Carol Dweck herself warns against what she calls 'false growth mindset.'
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="The Just Praise Effort Fallacy">
## False Growth Mindset #1

**"Just praise effort" fallacy:**

❌ **False approach:**
"Great effort!" (regardless of outcome or strategy)

**Problems:**
- Effort alone doesn't guarantee improvement
- Doesn't teach strategic learning
- Students learn to value trying over achieving

✅ **Authentic approach:**
Praise *process*—effort combined with effective strategies

**Example:**
- ❌ "You worked so hard! Great job!" (ineffective work)
- ✅ "I see you tried a new strategy—breaking material into chunks. That paid off."

<speaker-notes>
The first way growth mindset gets misapplied: 'Just praise effort.' Effort without effective strategy doesn't produce results. We should praise process—effort plus strategy plus seeking help. Praising effort regardless of outcome teaches learned helplessness. Example: A student studies for 10 hours using ineffective methods. "Great effort!" doesn't help them—they need strategy feedback.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="The Everyone Can Do Anything Fallacy">
## False Growth Mindset #2

**"Everyone can do anything" oversimplification:**

❌ **False approach:**
"You can be anything you want if you just believe in yourself!"

**Problems:**
- Ignores real constraints (resources, opportunities, barriers)
- Sets up unrealistic expectations
- Sounds like empty motivational speak

✅ **Authentic approach:**
"You can develop skills through strategic effort, though external factors also affect outcomes."

**Example:**
- ❌ "You can become a concert pianist if you believe!" (to someone who's never played)
- ✅ "If you're interested in music, you can develop skills through practice. Progress depends on time, instruction quality, and deliberate practice."

<speaker-notes>
The second fallacy: 'You can be anything you want!' Growth mindset doesn't mean unlimited potential regardless of context. It means abilities can develop through strategic effort. Real constraints exist—resources, opportunities, starting points. False growth mindset sounds hollow and sets people up for disappointment. Authentic growth mindset acknowledges constraints while focusing on what can be developed.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="Growth Mindset Not Equal to Positive Thinking">
## False Growth Mindset #3

**"Just think positively" confusion:**

❌ **False approach:**
Telling yourself "I can do this!" without changing strategy

**Problems:**
- Positive self-talk without action doesn't create growth
- Confuses mindset with wishful thinking
- Doesn't address actual skill gaps

✅ **Authentic approach:**
Growth mindset + deliberate practice + strategic adjustment

**Example:**
- ❌ "I got a D, but I have a growth mindset, so I'll do better!" (no change)
- ✅ "I got a D because my strategy wasn't effective. I need to: start earlier, use active recall, form a study group, attend office hours."

<speaker-notes>
The third fallacy: treating growth mindset as positive thinking. Growth mindset without action is useless. Real growth mindset equals belief plus effective strategy plus help-seeking plus persistence. The complete formula: You can develop abilities through (1) effort, (2) effective strategies, (3) seeking help, (4) persisting through setbacks. This is action-oriented, not just belief-oriented.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="content" title="Growth Mindset Self-Assessment">
## Rate Yourself Honestly (1-5)

| Statement | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| When I fail, I analyze what went wrong and try a different approach | |
| I actively seek feedback on my work, even when uncomfortable | |
| When someone excels where I struggle, I try to learn from them | |
| I invest time developing weak skills, not just strong ones | |
| When challenged, I ask "What strategy could help?" not "Am I capable?" | |
| I view mistakes as learning opportunities, not evidence of inadequacy | |

**Mostly 4-5:** Demonstrating growth mindset behaviors
**Mostly 1-3:** May hold beliefs but not translating to action

<speaker-notes>
Let's do a quick self-assessment. Be honest—this is for you, not for me. Give students 2 minutes to rate themselves. Debrief: If you scored mostly 4-5, you're demonstrating growth mindset behaviors. If you scored mostly 1-3, you may hold the beliefs but aren't yet translating them into action. That's the development work for this course and your PDP.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="content" title="Recognizing Your Fixed Mindset Triggers">
## Everyone Has Fixed Mindset Triggers

**Common triggers:**

1. **Skills you struggled with early**
   - "I was bad at math in high school, so I'm not a numbers person"

2. **Areas where you compare unfavorably**
   - "My roommate is so much better at public speaking—I'll never be that confident"

3. **High-stakes situations**
   - "This interview is too important—I can't afford to mess up"

4. **Unfamiliar domains**
   - "I'm not technical, so I can't learn AI tools"

**Reflection:** What's YOUR fixed mindset trigger?

<speaker-notes>
Everyone has fixed mindset triggers—domains or situations where you default to 'I can't.' Early struggles become permanent identity ("I'm not a math person"). Social comparison triggers fixed beliefs ("They're naturally better"). Pressure activates self-protection ("Can't afford to fail"). Unfamiliarity becomes permanent limitation ("Not a tech person"). Individual reflection for 3 minutes: Identify one domain where you have a fixed mindset. Write down the self-talk you use.

<slide number="17" layout="section-break" title="Section 3: Learning from Failure">
# SECTION 3

## Learning from Failure
### Building Career Resilience

*(20 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Now let's talk about something everyone experiences but few handle well: failure.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Redefining Failure">
## From Threat to Information

**Fixed mindset view:**
- Failure = proof of inadequacy
- "I failed, therefore I'm a failure"
- Failure is identity-defining
- Must avoid failure at all costs

**Growth mindset view:**
- Failure = feedback about what needs adjustment
- "This approach didn't work; what can I learn?"
- Failure is performance-specific, not identity-defining
- Failure is necessary for learning

**Sara Blakely (Spanx founder):**
"My dad asked us what we failed at each week. If we didn't have something, he'd be disappointed."

<speaker-notes>
How you view failure determines whether you grow from it or are destroyed by it. Fixed mindset: Failure threatens your identity, so you avoid situations where you might fail. Growth mindset: Failure provides information about what to adjust next time. Sara Blakely's dad reframed failure as learning, not shame. She faced hundreds of rejections launching Spanx. Each "no" was information, not proof she should quit. Vietnamese culture emphasizes academic achievement and success. Failure can feel like losing face. But entrepreneurial success often requires multiple failures. Can you separate 'failing at something' from 'being a failure'?
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="framework" title="The Failure Analysis Framework">
## Strategic Learning from Setbacks

**Step 1: Describe objectively**
- "I didn't get the internship" (NOT "I'm terrible at interviews")

**Step 2: Analyze strategically**
- Controllable factors: "I didn't research the company thoroughly"
- Uncontrollable factors: "They may have had an internal candidate"

**Step 3: Extract lessons**
- "I need to practice behavioral questions"
- "I need deeper company research"

**Step 4: Adjust strategy**
- Specific actions for next time

**Step 5: Persist with new approach**
- Apply improved strategy; track what works

<speaker-notes>
Here's a practical framework for turning failure into growth. Step 1: Objective description—not catastrophizing, not minimizing. Step 2: Separate what you could control from what you couldn't. Step 3: Extract specific, actionable lessons. Step 4: Create concrete plan for next time. Step 5: Keep trying with improved approach. This is not 'just stay positive'—this is strategic learning from setbacks.

**[VIDEO: Angela Duckworth - "Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance"]**

**Video link:** https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance

**Duration:** 6 minutes

**Before watching:** "What's the difference between grit and growth mindset?"

<speaker-notes>
Let's hear from Angela Duckworth, who researches grit—a related but distinct concept. Pre-viewing question: "How do you think grit relates to growth mindset?" After the video, discuss: "How does grit relate to growth mindset? Can you be gritty without a growth mindset?"
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="Grit vs. Resilience">
## Related but Distinct Concepts

**Grit (Angela Duckworth):**
- Passion and perseverance for long-term goals
- Sticking with the SAME goal over years
- "Marathon" mindset

**Resilience:**
- Bouncing back from setbacks
- Adapting to changing circumstances
- Strategic flexibility (knowing when to persist vs. pivot)

**Both require growth mindset, but:**
- Grit = sustained focus on one goal
- Resilience = capacity to recover and adapt

**In today's career environment:** You need adaptive resilience—persist when goal is right, pivot when circumstances change fundamentally.

<speaker-notes>
Grit and resilience are related but distinct. Grit equals long-term perseverance toward a specific goal. Resilience equals ability to recover, adapt, and keep moving forward. In stable environments (rare today), grit was enough—pick a path, stick 40 years. In dynamic environments (today's reality), you need adaptive resilience. Persist through challenges when the goal is still right. Pivot when circumstances change fundamentally. Reskill when your field evolves. Growth mindset enables both grit and resilience.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="content" title="The Role of Self-Compassion">
## Why Self-Criticism Undermines Growth

**Surprising finding:**
Harsh self-criticism after failure *undermines* growth mindset.

**Why?**
- Emotional resources go to self-protection, not learning
- You avoid similar situations in the future
- Anxiety interferes with strategic analysis

**Self-compassion (Kristin Neff):**
1. **Self-kindness** — Treat yourself as you'd treat a friend who made a mistake
2. **Common humanity** — Everyone struggles and fails
3. **Mindfulness** — Acknowledge feelings without over-identifying

**This isn't self-indulgence—it's strategic.**

<speaker-notes>
Here's a surprising finding: beating yourself up after failure actually prevents growth. Energy goes to defending yourself, not analyzing what happened. You avoid the domain to protect your ego. Anxiety blocks clear strategic thinking. Self-compassion is strategic: Treat yourself as you'd treat a friend who made a mistake. Recognize that everyone fails—you're not uniquely inadequate. Acknowledge the feelings, then move to strategic analysis. Example contrast: False approach: "I'm terrible at presentations. Everyone saw how nervous I was. I'll never volunteer again." True approach: "That presentation didn't go well, and I feel embarrassed. But everyone has bad presentations. What specifically can I improve? I'll practice more, slow down, prepare better transitions."

# SECTION 4

## Reskilling & Career Adaptability
### Thriving in the AI Era

*(15 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Now let's connect growth mindset to something very practical: reskilling for the AI era.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Why Reskilling Matters">
## The Career Model Has Changed

**Traditional career model (pre-2000s):**
- Learn skills once (university)
- Apply them for 40 years
- Retire

**Current career model:**
- Learn foundational skills (university)
- Continuously reskill every 3-5 years
- Adapt to technological shifts
- Possibly change careers 2-3 times
- Never fully "retire" from learning

**WEF data (Week 1 callback):**
- 40% of core job skills will change by 2030
- 50% of employees will need reskilling by 2025

<speaker-notes>
Let's connect growth mindset to career reality. Old model: Learn once, apply forever. New model: Continuous reskilling cycle. The mindset connection: Fixed mindset: "I'm too old to learn new technology" leads to career stagnation. Growth mindset: "I can learn these skills through strategic effort" leads to career adaptability.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Growth Mindset Reskilling Strategies">
## How to Approach Learning New Skills

1. **Embrace "beginner's mind"**
   - Let go of ego: "I don't know this yet, and that's okay"

2. **Use scaffolded learning**
   - Start with foundations before advanced topics
   - Celebrate micro-progress

3. **Seek diverse learning methods**
   - Online courses, mentorship, peer learning, hands-on projects

4. **Apply immediately**
   - Don't just consume—use new skills in real contexts

5. **Join learning communities**
   - Find others learning the same skills
   - Accountability and mutual support

<speaker-notes>
Reskilling isn't just about what you learn—it's about how you approach learning. Beginner's mind: Let go of needing to look competent; ask basic questions. Scaffolded: Build foundational skills first; don't skip to advanced. Diverse methods: Find what works for your learning style (Week 4 callback). Apply immediately: Learning by doing (Kolb's cycle—Week 3 callback). Community: Learning with others provides support and accountability.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="content" title="Overcoming I'm Not Technical">
## The Most Common Fixed Mindset Belief

**Common self-limiting belief:**
"I'm not a tech person, so I can't learn AI/data analysis/programming."

**Why this is fixed mindset:**
- Assumes technical ability is innate, not developable
- Creates identity boundary ("I'm creative, not technical")
- Leads to avoiding learning opportunities

**Reality check:**
- "Technical" skills are learned, not genetic
- Many successful tech professionals started with zero background
- Business + technical = highly valuable combination

**Reframe:**
"I haven't developed technical skills *yet*. I can develop enough AI literacy to use tools effectively, collaborate with technical teams, and make informed decisions."

<speaker-notes>
Let me address the most common fixed mindset belief I hear from business students. Technical skills are learned through practice, not inherited at birth. You don't need to become a software engineer. You need AI literacy and collaborative capacity. What you actually need: Use AI tools effectively. Collaborate with technical teams. Understand data insights. Make informed technology decisions. That's achievable for any business student willing to learn.

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Reskilling Planning for Your PDP">
## Add a Reskilling Plan to Your PDP

**Near-term (1 year):**
- What emerging skill will be valuable in your field?
- How will you develop basic competency?
- What resources will you use?

**Medium-term (3 years):**
- What skills will your industry likely require?
- What credentials or certifications might help?

**Long-term (5 years):**
- What technological shifts might reshape your field?
- How will you position yourself for these changes?

**Growth mindset application:**
Include specific reframes for the fixed mindset triggers you'll face.

<speaker-notes>
Your PDP should include a reskilling plan. Here's the structure. Near-term: Specific skill you'll develop in the next year. Medium-term: Skills your industry will require. Long-term: Positioning for future technological shifts. Turn and talk for 3 minutes: Based on your career interests, what's one skill you'll likely need to develop in the next 3 years?

## Integrating Growth Mindset
### Into Your Personal Development Plan

*(10 minutes)*

<speaker-notes>
Let's close by connecting today's content directly to your PDP, due in 2 weeks.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="29" layout="content" title="Mindset in Your PDP">
## Growth Mindset Should Underpin Every Component

**In your vision statement:**
- ❌ "I want to be a manager because I'm naturally good with people"
- ✅ "I will develop into a leader by building strategic thinking, data literacy, and team leadership skills"

**In your SMART goals:**
- ❌ "Avoid roles requiring public speaking"
- ✅ "Develop public speaking confidence by presenting in 3 class settings and joining Toastmasters"

**In your SWOT analysis:**
- ❌ List weaknesses as permanent traits ("Bad at math")
- ✅ List weaknesses as developable gaps ("Need to improve quantitative analysis through practice")

<speaker-notes>
Your PDP components should reflect growth mindset throughout. Vision: Focus on developing capabilities, not inherent traits. SMART goals: Include skill development, not just avoidance. SWOT: Frame weaknesses as development opportunities, not permanent limitations. Skills gap: Plan for developing weak areas, not just leveraging strengths.

## Questions to Ask Your Mentor

**About mindset and resilience:**

1. "Can you tell me about a significant professional failure? How did you respond and what did you learn?"

2. "What skills have you had to develop mid-career? How did you approach learning something completely new?"

3. "When you see someone excel where you're not strong, how do you respond?"

4. "Looking at my draft PDP, where do you see fixed mindset limiting my goals?"

5. "How do you maintain a learning orientation in your current role?"

## Today's Core Messages

1. **Mindset is a meaning system** — It shapes goals, effort beliefs, and responses to challenges

2. **Growth mindset is developable** — You're not stuck with your current beliefs

3. **False growth mindset is common** — Authentic growth = belief + effective strategy + help-seeking + persistence

4. **Failure is information** — Use the Failure Analysis Framework to learn strategically

5. **Reskilling requires growth mindset** — Career adaptability depends on believing you can learn

6. **Self-compassion enables growth** — Harsh self-criticism undermines learning

<speaker-notes>
Let me summarize the key takeaways from today. Mindset creates a whole system of beliefs and behaviors. You can develop growth mindset through practice. Real growth mindset requires action, not just positive thinking. Learn from failure strategically, not emotionally. Career survival in AI era requires belief you can learn new skills. Be kind to yourself after setbacks—it's strategic, not soft.

## The View You Adopt Profoundly Affects Your Life

**Carol Dweck:**
> "The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life."

**This is evidence, not motivation:**
- Students with growth mindsets persist longer and achieve more
- Professionals with growth mindsets adapt better to change
- Organizations with growth mindset cultures innovate more

**The most important insight:**
**Mindset is itself developable.**

You can notice fixed mindset, challenge it, reframe it, and practice growth mindset behaviors. The capacity starts with the decision to develop it.

<speaker-notes>
Let me close with Dweck's most important insight. This isn't motivational fluff—it's research evidence. Mindset predicts outcomes across studies, nations, and contexts. The meta-insight: Mindset itself can be developed. You're not stuck with whatever beliefs you currently hold. The decision to develop growth mindset is the first step. Your career in 2030 will require continuous adaptation. What won't change: your capacity to learn, adapt, and grow. That capacity starts with mindset.
