### Slide 6 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 1

## Fixed vs. Growth Mindset Framework

### Slide 7 (Layout: content)

## What Are Mindsets?

**Definition (Dweck & Yeager, 2019):**

**Mindset** = A "meaning system" - a set of beliefs that creates coherent patterns of:
- Goals we pursue
- Beliefs about effort
- Attributions we make
- Behaviors in response to challenges

**Two Core Mindsets:**

**Fixed Mindset:** Intelligence and abilities are static traits
- "You either have it or you don't"
- Talent is innate and unchangeable

**Growth Mindset:** Intelligence and abilities can be developed
- "You can cultivate your abilities through effort and strategies"
- Potential is nurtured over time

### Slide 8 (Layout: framework)

## The Mindset Cascade: How Beliefs Shape Behavior

**Fixed Mindset Pattern:**
1. Belief: "Intelligence is fixed"
2. Goal: Prove I'm smart → Performance goals
3. Effort: Means I lack ability → Avoid effort
4. Failure: Proves I'm not smart → Helpless response
5. Behavior: Avoid challenges, give up easily

**Growth Mindset Pattern:**
1. Belief: "Intelligence can be developed"
2. Goal: Learn and improve → Learning goals
3. Effort: Path to mastery → Embrace effort
4. Failure: Information for improvement → Resilient response
5. Behavior: Seek challenges, persist through difficulty

**Result:** Same objective challenge, completely different response

### Slide 9 (Layout: content)

## Dweck's Research Journey: From Lab to World

**Carol Dweck's 40+ Year Research Arc:**

**Era 1 (1970s-2000s): Basic Research**
- How do children respond to failure?
- What explains resilience vs. helplessness?
- Discovery: Beliefs about intelligence predict responses

**Era 2 (2000s-2020s): Applied Interventions**
- Can mindsets be taught?
- National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM): 12,000+ students
- Short (<1 hour) online intervention improved grades and course-taking

**Key Insight (Dweck, 2019):**

> "I realized I had a choice to make: use what I learn for the benefit of individuals and society, or just keep it in academic journals."

### Slide 10 (Layout: content)

## False Growth Mindset: What It's NOT

**Common Misconceptions (Dweck, 2019):**

❌ "Just praise effort" → Leads to empty effort without strategy

❌ "Just be positive" → Ignores importance of effective strategies

❌ "Everyone can achieve anything" → Unrealistic and dismissive of real constraints

❌ "Mindset is all that matters" → Ignores systemic barriers and resources

**True Growth Mindset:**

✓ Effort + Effective strategies + Learning from feedback

✓ Positive but realistic about obstacles

✓ Focus on developing potential within realistic constraints

✓ Acknowledge that mindset works alongside opportunity and support

### Slide 11 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 2

## Neuroplasticity - The Science Behind Growth Mindset

### Slide 12 (Layout: content)

## Neuroplasticity: Your Brain is Not Fixed

**Neuroplasticity Definition:**
The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life

**Key Principles:**
1. **Use it or lose it:** Neural pathways that aren't used weaken
2. **Use it and improve it:** Repeated practice strengthens connections
3. **Specificity matters:** Practice what you want to improve
4. **Intensity matters:** Focused, effortful practice drives change

**The Brain-as-Muscle Metaphor:**

> "The brain is like a muscle - it gets stronger (and smarter) when you exercise it"
>
> *Dweck & Yeager (2019)*

### Slide 13 (Layout: content)

## How Learning Changes Your Brain

**When you learn something new:**

1. **Neurons fire together** in response to new information
2. **Synaptic connections form** between neurons
3. **Repeated practice strengthens** these connections (long-term potentiation)
4. **Myelin sheaths thicken** around frequently used pathways (speeds signal transmission)
5. **Neural networks optimize** - more efficient processing over time

**Result:**
What was once difficult and effortful becomes easier and more automatic

**Career Implication:**
Skills that feel impossible today can become strengths tomorrow through deliberate practice

### Slide 14 (Layout: content)

## Growth Mindset Intervention: Core Content

**What the Research-Based Intervention Teaches (Yeager & Dweck, 2020):**

**Message 1:** Abilities can be developed through action
- Not fixed traits you're born with

**Message 2:** The brain is like a muscle
- Neuroplasticity is real and happens throughout life

**Message 3:** Specific actions that develop abilities
- **Effort** (trying hard)
- **Strategy change** (trying different approaches)
- **Help-seeking** (learning from others)

**Delivery:** Autonomy-supportive, not didactic
- Students discover concepts through reading and reflection
- Not lecturing people to "just have a growth mindset"

### Slide 15 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 3

## Embracing Challenges & Learning from Failure

### Slide 16 (Layout: content)

## How Mindsets Affect Challenge-Seeking

**Fixed Mindset Approach to Challenges:**
- Avoid challenges that might reveal limitations
- Prefer tasks you already know you can do well
- Challenge = Risk of looking incompetent
- "If I'm smart, it should be easy"

**Growth Mindset Approach to Challenges:**
- Seek challenges that will stretch current abilities
- Embrace tasks slightly beyond current comfort zone
- Challenge = Opportunity to develop new capabilities
- "If it's easy, I'm not learning anything"

**Dweck's Classic Study:**
Children could choose next puzzle: easier than last one or harder
- Fixed mindset children: 2/3 chose easier
- Growth mindset children: 90%+ chose harder

### Slide 17 (Layout: content)

## Learning from Failure: The Growth Mindset Advantage

**When you experience failure or setback:**

**Fixed Mindset Response:**
- **Attribution:** "I failed because I lack ability"
- **Emotion:** Shame, helplessness
- **Behavior:** Give up, avoid similar tasks, make excuses
- **Learning:** Minimal - focused on self-protection

**Growth Mindset Response:**
- **Attribution:** "I failed because my strategy was ineffective"
- **Emotion:** Disappointment but determination
- **Behavior:** Analyze what went wrong, try different approach
- **Learning:** Maximal - failure becomes feedback

**Vietnamese Proverb:**
*"Thất bại là mẹ thành công"* (Failure is the mother of success)
- Growth mindset embodies this wisdom

### Slide 18 (Layout: content)

## Dweck's Own Example: Learning from Controversy

**The Growth Mindset Controversies (2018-2020):**

**The Challenge:**
- Meta-analysis criticized mindset research (Sisk et al., 2018)
- Claims: "Effects are small or non-existent"
- Media amplified criticism: "Growth mindset debunked!"

**Dweck's Growth Mindset Response (2019, 2020):**
1. Acknowledged legitimate critiques
2. Conducted new large-scale pre-registered studies
3. Clarified what growth mindset is and isn't
4. Developed heterogeneity framework (when/where it works)

**Quote:**

> "Challenges and controversies became opportunities that improved the science"
>
> *Dweck (2019)*

### Slide 19 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 4

## Growth Mindset for Career Resilience

### Slide 20 (Layout: content)

## Reskilling and Upskilling in the AI Era

**Why Growth Mindset Matters for Career Resilience:**

**Fixed Mindset Career Trap:**
- "I'm a marketing person, not a data person" → Limits opportunities
- Avoids learning new technologies: "I'm too old to learn Python"
- Resists industry changes: "This is how we've always done it"
- Career stagnates as field evolves

**Growth Mindset Career Advantage:**
- "I can develop data skills if marketing roles require them"
- Embraces learning new tools: "Python will be challenging but valuable"
- Adapts to industry evolution: "What new capabilities do I need?"
- Career evolves alongside field

**Week 1 Connection:**
AI is reshaping every industry - your ability to reskill determines your career resilience

### Slide 21 (Layout: content)

## Self-Regulated Learning Across the Lifespan

**Growth Mindset Enables Lifelong Learning:**

**The Learning Cycle (connecting to Week 4):**
1. **Set learning goals** (not just performance goals)
2. **Monitor progress** metacognitively
3. **Adjust strategies** when current approach isn't working
4. **Persist through challenges** with effort + strategy changes
5. **Reflect on learning** to extract insights

**Growth Mindset at Different Career Stages:**

**Early Career (20s-30s):** Building foundational skills
**Mid-Career (30s-40s):** Developing expertise, taking on leadership
**Late Career (50s-60s+):** Adapting to industry shifts, mentoring others

*At every stage: belief that you can continue developing new capabilities*

### Slide 22 (Layout: content)

## Context-Specific Growth Mindsets

**Important Research Finding (Yeager & Dweck, 2020):**

You can have **different mindsets in different domains**

**Examples:**
- Growth mindset about business skills, fixed mindset about artistic ability
- Growth mindset about technical skills, fixed mindset about interpersonal skills
- Growth mindset about academic learning, fixed mindset about athletic ability

**Why This Matters:**
1. Don't assume your mindset is the same across all areas
2. Identify domains where you have fixed mindset beliefs
3. Those are precisely the areas where growth mindset could help most
4. Challenge domain-specific fixed beliefs: "I'm not a people person" → "I can develop interpersonal skills"

### Slide 23 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 5

## Strategies to Develop Growth Mindset

### Slide 24 (Layout: content)

## Strategy 1: Reframe Your Inner Voice

**The Fixed Mindset Voice vs. Growth Mindset Response:**

**Situation: Struggling with new skill**

❌ Fixed: "I'm not good at this" or "This is too hard for me"
✓ Growth: "I'm not good at this **YET**" or "This is challenging right now"

**Situation: Receiving criticism**

❌ Fixed: "They think I'm incompetent" or "I should already know this"
✓ Growth: "This feedback will help me improve" or "What can I learn from this?"

**Situation: Watching someone excel**

❌ Fixed: "They're naturally talented; I can't compete"
✓ Growth: "What strategies are they using that I could learn?"

**The Power of "Yet":**
Adding "yet" transforms fixed statements into growth statements

### Slide 25 (Layout: content)

## Strategy 2: Focus on Process, Not Just Outcomes

**Shift Your Self-Talk and Goal-Setting:**

**Outcome Focus (Fixed Mindset Tendency):**
- "Did I succeed or fail?"
- "Do I look smart?"
- "What's my grade/score/rank?"

**Process Focus (Growth Mindset Approach):**
- "What did I learn?"
- "What strategies worked or didn't work?"
- "How can I improve my approach?"
- "What effort did I apply?"

**Application to Your PDP Goals:**

❌ Outcome-only: "Achieve 80% in all courses"

✓ Process-included: "Achieve 80% by using spaced repetition study, weekly mentor check-ins, and practice problem sets"

*Process goals give you control even when outcomes are uncertain*

### Slide 26 (Layout: content)

## Strategy 3: Embrace "Strategic Failures"

**Redefine Failure as Feedback:**

**Before (Fixed Mindset Interpretation):**
Failure = Evidence I lack ability → Avoid challenges

**After (Growth Mindset Interpretation):**
Failure = Information about what doesn't work → Try different strategy

**Strategic Failure Framework:**
1. **Try** a challenging approach (even if success isn't guaranteed)
2. **Observe** what happens (data collection)
3. **Analyze** why approach didn't work (diagnosis)
4. **Adjust** strategy based on analysis (iteration)
5. **Try again** with refined approach (persistence)

*This is the scientific method applied to your development*

**Quote to Remember:**
*"Thất bại là mẹ thành công"* (Failure is the mother of success)

### Slide 27 (Layout: content)

## Strategy 4: Seek and Use Feedback Actively

**Growth Mindset Approach to Feedback:**

**1. Actively Seek Feedback**
- Don't wait for formal reviews
- Ask specific questions: "What's one thing I could improve?"
- Request feedback from mentors, professors, peers

**2. Receive Feedback Non-Defensively**
- Listen fully before responding
- Resist urge to explain or justify
- Thank the person for their input

**3. Extract Actionable Insights**
- "What specifically can I do differently?"
- "What resources or strategies would help?"

**4. Implement and Follow Up**
- Act on feedback to demonstrate growth mindset
- Report back: "I tried your suggestion; here's what happened"

**Mentorship Connection:** Use your mentor meetings to practice this

### Slide 28 (Layout: content)

## Strategy 5: Celebrate Effort and Strategy, Not Just Talent

**What to Praise in Yourself and Others:**

❌ **Trait Praise:** "I'm smart" / "You're talented"
- Reinforces fixed mindset
- Creates fear of challenges that might disprove trait

✓ **Process Praise:** "I used effective strategies" / "You tried multiple approaches"
- Reinforces growth mindset
- Builds confidence in controllable factors

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- What strategies did I use today?
- What effort did I apply?
- What did I learn from this challenge?
- How did I persist when things got difficult?

**Celebrate learning, not just performance**

### Slide 29 (Layout: section-break)

# Integration and Application

### Slide 30 (Layout: content)

## Applying Growth Mindset to Your PDP

**Your PDP Through a Growth Mindset Lens:**

**Goal-Setting:**
✓ Set "stretch goals" that require developing new capabilities
✓ Include process goals alongside outcome goals
✓ Frame goals as learning objectives, not just performance targets

**Obstacle Planning:**
✓ Anticipate setbacks as normal part of development
✓ Plan multiple strategies for each goal
✓ Build in accountability and feedback mechanisms

**Self-Assessment Integration:**
✓ View current abilities as starting point, not destiny
✓ Focus on developing areas of weakness, not just leveraging strengths

**Timeline:**
✓ Recognize that meaningful development takes time
✓ Measure progress, not perfection

### Slide 31 (Layout: content)

## Key Takeaways: Research-Backed Insights

**What the Science Tells Us:**

1. **Mindsets are belief systems that shape motivation and behavior** (Dweck & Yeager, 2019)

2. **The brain is plastic throughout life - abilities can be developed** (neuroplasticity research)

3. **Growth mindset affects challenge-seeking and resilience** (Dweck's 40+ years of research)

4. **Effective growth mindset = effort + strategy + help-seeking** (not just praise for trying)

5. **Mindsets can be changed** (intervention research shows meaningful effects)

6. **Growth mindset is especially valuable in contexts of challenge and uncertainty** (Yeager & Dweck, 2020)

**Your career in the AI era will require continuous reskilling - growth mindset is your foundation**

### Slide 32 (Layout: content)

## Reflection: Revisiting Your Mindset Assessment

**Return to Your Opening Self-Assessment:**

Look back at your responses to the four mindset items:

1. Are you satisfied with your current mindset beliefs?
2. In which domains (academic, professional, interpersonal, creative) do you hold fixed beliefs?
3. How might fixed mindset beliefs be limiting your development?
4. What's one specific fixed belief you want to challenge this week?

**Action Commitment:**
Choose ONE area where you'll deliberately apply growth mindset strategies this week and share with a partner

**Mentorship Connection:**
Discuss growth vs. fixed mindset with your mentor - where do they see each in their career?
