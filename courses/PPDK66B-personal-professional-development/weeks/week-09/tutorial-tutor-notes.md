## Part-by-Part Facilitation Guide

### Opening: Quick Review (0:00-0:05)

**Setup:**
"Before we dive into today's activities, let's ground ourselves in a personal experience with mindset."

**Individual Reflection Prompt:**
"When was the last time you avoided a challenge because you feared you might not succeed? What was going through your mind?"

**Pair Share (1 minute each):**
Students share briefly with neighbor.

**Tutor Notes:**
- Model vulnerability: Share your own example if needed to get students comfortable
- This primes students to recognize fixed mindset in their own experience
- Don't spend too long here - it's just a warmup

**Transition:**
"Today we're moving from understanding growth mindset theory to actually applying it in your lives. You'll create a personalized plan for developing growth mindset in areas that matter most for your goals."

---

### Part 1: Domain-Specific Mindset Mapping (0:05-0:20)

**Objective:** Students identify where they hold fixed vs. growth mindsets across different domains

#### Phase 1: Individual Assessment (10 minutes)

**Instructions to Students:**
"Complete the Domain Mindset Assessment worksheet. For each domain, you'll rate your agreement with a fixed mindset statement on a 1-5 scale. Be honest - this is for your own insight, not for grading."

**Tutor Actions During Individual Work:**
- Circulate to ensure students understand the rating scale
- Check that students are actually reading and responding (not just checking boxes randomly)
- Look for patterns: Are most students struggling with same domains?

**Common Questions:**
- **Q:** "Should I answer based on what I believe or how I actually act?"
  - **A:** "Answer based on what you genuinely believe, even if you wish you believed something different."

- **Q:** "I rated everything 1-2. Is that okay?"
  - **A:** "That's fine, but push yourself to be honest. Most people have at least some domains where they hold more fixed beliefs. If everything is truly growth mindset for you, that's great - but in Part 2, challenge yourself to find areas for even more growth."

#### Phase 2: Reflection Questions (within 10 minutes)

Students answer:
1. Which 2-3 domains show strongest FIXED mindset (highest scores)?
2. Are these domains important for your career goals?
3. How might fixed beliefs in these domains be limiting you?

**Tutor Circulation Notes:**
- Look for students who identify domains critical to their career but have fixed mindsets
- Example: Student wants to be marketing manager but rates "interpersonal/social" as 5 (very fixed)
- Mark these for potential examples in class discussion (with permission)

#### Phase 3: Pair Share (5 minutes)

**Instructions:**
"Share your 2-3 highest fixed mindset domains with your partner. Discuss: How might these fixed beliefs have influenced your choices or behavior?"

**Tutor Actions:**
- Listen to conversations for good examples
- Intervene if students are judgmental ("You shouldn't think that way") - remind them fixed mindset isn't a character flaw
- Note: Some students may be vulnerable here - ensure respectful, confidential atmosphere

**Optional Class Share (if time):**
"Would anyone be willing to share a domain where you recognized a fixed mindset pattern and how it might have limited you?"

**Valid Responses to Look For:**
- "I scored high on creative domain - I've always avoided design or creative projects because I thought I wasn't creative"
- "I have fixed mindset about technical skills - I've been avoiding learning Python even though marketing roles increasingly need it"
- "I rated interpersonal domain as fixed - I don't attend networking events because I think I'm not good at connecting with people"

**Transition to Part 2:**
"Now that you've identified where you hold fixed mindsets, let's practice the skill of reframing fixed beliefs into growth mindset language."

---

### Part 2: Reframing Fixed Mindset Statements (0:20-0:40)

**Objective:** Students practice transforming fixed mindset language into growth mindset language

#### Phase 1: Group Reframing Activity (12 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Divide class into groups of 4-5
- Assign each group the same 8 fixed mindset statements (or different subsets if you want variety)
- Display instructions clearly

**The 8 Fixed Statements:**
1. "I'm just not a math person"
2. "I'm too shy to be good at networking"
3. "I don't have leadership potential"
4. "I'm not creative - I'm more analytical"
5. "I'm terrible at public speaking and always will be"
6. "I can't learn technical skills like coding at this point"
7. "I don't have the personality for sales or marketing"
8. "I'm not good at managing my time"

**Task Instructions:**
"For each statement:
1. Identify the fixed mindset assumption
2. Reframe it as a growth mindset statement
3. Add a specific action that reflects growth mindset"

**Tutor Circulation During Group Work:**

Monitor for these RED FLAGS (intervene immediately):

❌ **False Growth Mindset Reframings:**
- "I'm great at math, I just need to believe in myself!" (Overly positive, denies current reality)
- "If I just try harder at public speaking, I'll be fine" (Effort without strategy)
- "Anyone can do anything if they work hard enough" (Unrealistic, denies constraints)

✓ **Effective Growth Mindset Reframings:**
- "I haven't yet developed strong math skills, but I can improve through daily practice and tutoring"
- "Public speaking is challenging for me right now, but I can develop this skill through Toastmasters, recording myself, and seeking feedback"
- "I can develop time management capabilities by experimenting with different systems (time-blocking, Eisenhower Matrix) and tracking what works"

**Key Elements to Look For:**
1. ✓ Acknowledges current reality ("I haven't yet..." or "This is challenging for me right now...")
2. ✓ Implies future possibility ("but I can develop...")
3. ✓ Includes specific actions (effort + strategy + help-seeking)
4. ✓ Realistic about constraints (not "I can become world-class" but "I can improve")

#### Phase 2: Class Share (8 minutes)

**Instructions:**
"Each group will share 2-3 of your best reframings. I'll write key ones on the board."

**Facilitation Strategy:**
- Have 3-4 groups share
- After each sharing, ask class: "What makes this an effective growth mindset reframing?"
- Highlight the three components: Effort + Strategy + Help-seeking

**Teaching Points to Emphasize:**

1. **The Power of "Yet":**
"Notice how adding 'yet' or 'right now' completely changes the meaning. 'I'm not good at X' is a fixed verdict. 'I'm not good at X yet' is a temporary state."

2. **Specificity Matters:**
"'I can get better' is too vague. 'I can improve by attending Toastmasters weekly and practicing with friends' is actionable."

3. **Process > Trait:**
"Growth mindset focuses on processes (strategies, effort, feedback) not traits (talent, intelligence, personality)."

4. **Not Just Positive Thinking:**
"Growth mindset isn't 'I believe I can do it!' It's 'I can develop this capability through specific strategies and sustained effort.'"

**Common Student Responses:**

| Student Reframing | Quality | Tutor Feedback |
|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| "I'm actually good at math!" | Poor - Denial | "That's avoiding the reality. Try: 'I haven't developed strong math skills yet, but I can through...'" |
| "I can improve with hard work" | Weak - Vague | "Good start, but be specific. What exactly will you do? How often?" |
| "I can develop leadership skills through taking on team leader roles, seeking mentor feedback, and reading leadership books" | Excellent - Specific | "Perfect! You included all three: effort (taking on roles), strategy (reading), help-seeking (mentor)" |

**Transition to Part 3:**
"Now let's take this skill and apply it to real challenges you're facing right now."

---

### Part 3: Applying Growth Mindset to Current Challenges (0:40-1:00)

**Objective:** Students apply growth mindset framework to their actual challenges

#### Phase 1: Individual Reflection (10 minutes)

**Instructions:**
"Choose ONE real challenge you're facing right now - could be related to your PDP, mentorship, coursework, career prep, or personal development. Work through the reflection questions in your workbook."

**The 6 Reflection Questions:**
1. Describe the Challenge
2. Identify Fixed Mindset Thoughts
3. Reframe with Growth Mindset
4. Effort + Strategy + Help-Seeking
5. Strategic Failure Plan (Plan B)
6. Success Metrics (Process and Outcome)

**Tutor Circulation - Critical Phase:**

This is where students connect theory to their lives. Circulate actively and intervene when needed.

**Look for these COMMON ISSUES:**

❌ **Issue 1: Vague challenge descriptions**
- Student writes: "I need to do better in school"
- **Intervention:** "Be more specific. Which subject? What aspect is challenging? What specifically happens when you struggle?"

❌ **Issue 2: Vague strategies**
- Student writes: "I will try harder and be more organized"
- **Intervention:** "What does 'try harder' look like specifically? What organization system will you use? When will you use it?"

❌ **Issue 3: Missing help-seeking**
- Student only lists effort and strategy, no help-seeking
- **Intervention:** "Who could you learn from? Who has expertise in this area? What resources exist?"

❌ **Issue 4: No failure plan**
- Student leaves Strategic Failure Plan blank
- **Intervention:** "If your first strategy doesn't work in two weeks, what will you try instead? Having a Plan B prevents giving up."

❌ **Issue 5: Only outcome metrics**
- Student writes: "Success = getting 80% on next exam"
- **Intervention:** "That's an outcome metric. What process metrics will you track? How will you measure whether you're consistently applying your strategies?"

✓ **Excellent Example to Model:**

**Challenge:** "I struggle to contribute in group project discussions"

**Fixed Mindset Thoughts:** "I'm too quiet," "Others are naturally better at speaking up," "I don't have good ideas"

**Growth Mindset Reframe:** "I haven't yet developed confidence in group settings, but I can build this skill through practice and preparation"

**Effort + Strategy + Help:**
- Effort: Prepare 3 points before every meeting
- Strategy: Start by asking questions before sharing opinions (lower stakes)
- Help: Ask high-contributing teammate: "How do you prepare for meetings?"

**Plan B:** If still struggling after 3 weeks, try one-on-one conversations with teammates before meetings

**Metrics:**
- Process: Prepared 3 points before every meeting (yes/no)
- Outcome: Contributed at least 2 times per meeting by Week 3

#### Phase 2: Pair Share + Accountability (8 minutes)

**Instructions:**
"Share your challenge and growth mindset plan with a partner. Your partner will give feedback and then you'll exchange contact info for accountability."

**Partner Feedback Prompts (display these):**
- "I notice you're focusing on controllable factors like..."
- "One thing you might also consider is..."
- "How will you know if you need to adjust your strategy?"

**Accountability Setup (last 2 minutes):**
"Exchange phone numbers or social media contacts. Check in with each other in one week: 'Did you implement your strategy? What happened?'"

**Tutor Notes:**
- This accountability often fails unless you make it concrete right now
- Have students actually exchange contacts before leaving this section
- Consider creating a class accountability channel (Facebook group, WhatsApp) if appropriate

**Transition to Part 4:**
"Now you'll create a comprehensive Growth Mindset Development Plan focused on one high-priority domain."

---

### Part 4: Personal Growth Mindset Development Plan (1:00-1:20)

**Objective:** Students create actionable plans for cultivating growth mindset in high-priority domains

#### Individual Work with Template (18 minutes)

**Instructions:**
"Using the template, create your Personal Growth Mindset Development Plan. Choose ONE domain where you have fixed mindset AND it matters for your goals. Work through all 8 parts of the template."

**The 8 Template Parts:**
1. Target Domain Selection
2. Current Fixed Belief Statement
3. Growth Mindset Reframe
4. Neuroplasticity Connection
5. Development Strategies (Effort + Strategy + Help)
6. Tracking Progress (Process & Outcome Metrics)
7. Strategic Failure Response Plan
8. Self-Talk Reminders

**Tutor Circulation - Heaviest Intervention Phase:**

You will need to circulate constantly and provide substantial guidance. Budget 1-2 minutes per student.

**Part 1: Domain Selection**

✓ **Good:** Student selects domain important to career (e.g., interpersonal skills for marketing career)
❌ **Poor:** Student selects domain they don't care about (e.g., athletic ability when they have no athletic goals)

**Intervention if needed:** "Is this domain actually important for your career or PDP goals? If not, choose something more relevant."

**Part 2: Fixed Belief Statement**

✓ **Good:** Honest, specific statement ("I believe I lack the natural charisma for sales")
❌ **Poor:** Vague or dishonest ("I guess I'm not perfect at everything")

**Part 3: Growth Mindset Reframe**

✓ **Good:** "I haven't yet developed sales skills, but I can through role-play practice, studying persuasion principles, and shadowing successful salespeople"
❌ **Poor:** "I can be good at sales if I believe in myself"

**Part 4: Neuroplasticity Connection**

This is often where students struggle. They need to connect their specific skill to brain plasticity.

**Example of what you want to see:**
"When I practice public speaking, neurons involved in speech production, emotional regulation, and audience reading fire together. With repeated practice, synaptic connections strengthen. The myelin sheaths around these pathways thicken, making the process more automatic. Over time, what feels terrifying now will feel manageable."

**If student is stuck:**
"Think about what's happening in your brain when you practice [their skill]. Which neural pathways are being activated? How does repeated practice change these pathways?"

**Part 5: Development Strategies**

CHECK FOR SPECIFICITY:

❌ Vague: "I will practice more"
✓ Specific: "I will practice 30 minutes daily using Duolingo for vocabulary + weekly conversation exchange"

❌ Vague: "I will try different approaches"
✓ Specific: "I will try time-blocking for 2 weeks, then try Pomodoro technique for 2 weeks, comparing productivity"

❌ Vague: "I will ask for help"
✓ Specific: "I will ask my mentor for feedback on my networking approach in our next meeting"

**Part 6: Tracking Progress**

ENSURE BOTH PROCESS AND OUTCOME METRICS:

**Process metrics = behaviors you control:**
- [ ] Practiced 30 minutes daily (yes/no checklist)
- [ ] Attended 2 networking events per month
- [ ] Asked for feedback weekly

**Outcome metrics = results you're working toward:**
- Week 4: Hold 2-minute conversation with stranger comfortably
- Week 8: Collect 5 meaningful professional contacts
- Week 12: Feel confident initiating conversations at events

**Common mistake:** Students only include outcome metrics. Push them to add process metrics.

**Part 7: Strategic Failure Response**

Students often skip this. Don't let them.

"What specifically will you do if your first approach doesn't work? Having a Plan B prevents giving up when Plan A struggles."

✓ **Good:** "If daily practice feels too burdensome after 2 weeks, I'll try 3x per week instead and assess if that's more sustainable"
❌ **Poor:** "I'll try harder"

**Part 8: Self-Talk Reminders**

These should be personal mantras they'll actually use.

**Examples:**
- "I haven't mastered this YET"
- "This struggle means my brain is growing"
- "What strategy should I try next?"
- "Failure is feedback, not verdict"

**Encourage culturally relevant reminders:**
- Vietnamese students might use: "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" (Failure is mother of success)

#### Final Reflection (2 minutes)

**Quick Write:**
- "What's the most important insight you gained from creating this plan?"
- "What's the first action you'll take this week?"

**Tutor Note:** Collect a few responses verbally to synthesize key insights for whole class.

---

### Before Next Class & Wrapup (1:20-1:30)

#### Phase 1: Individual Reflection & Integration (5 minutes)

**Three Questions:**
1. Mindset Insight: What did you learn about your mindset patterns today?
2. PDP Connection: How will you integrate growth mindset into your PDP goals?
3. Immediate Action: What's ONE strategy you'll apply before next week?

**Tutor Actions:**
- Give students genuine quiet time for reflection
- This consolidates learning

#### Phase 2: Facilitator Wrapup (5 minutes)

**Key Takeaways to Emphasize:**

1. **"Mindsets are domain-specific"**
"You're not 'a fixed mindset person' or 'a growth mindset person.' You have different beliefs in different domains. Target the ones that matter for your goals."

2. **"Reframing requires specificity"**
"Growth mindset isn't just 'be positive.' It's realistic acknowledgment that abilities develop through effort + effective strategies + help-seeking."

3. **"Process focus gives you control"**
"You can't always control outcomes, but you can control your effort, strategies, and who you learn from. Focus on what you can control."

4. **"Failure is feedback"**
"Strategic failures are necessary for learning. The question isn't 'Will I fail?' but 'How will I respond when I do?'"

5. **"Growth mindset enables your PDP"**
"Your ability to achieve your Personal Development Plan goals depends on believing those goals are achievable through sustained effort and effective strategies."

**Assignments & Next Steps:**

**For Next Week (Week 10):**
1. Implement your Growth Mindset Development Plan - at least ONE action
2. Read Week 10 materials (Guest Speaker preparation)
3. If Mentorship Meeting 4 is scheduled, discuss growth mindset with mentor

**Continuing Work:**
- PDP Draft: Integrate growth mindset framing
- Notice and reframe your fixed mindset voice this week

**Final Thought:**
"If you truly believed your abilities could be developed, what would you attempt that you're currently avoiding? This week, I challenge you to attempt one thing you've been avoiding."

---

## Common Facilitation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Students Resist Identifying Fixed Mindsets

**Symptom:** Students rate everything 1-2 on Domain Assessment (all growth mindset)

**Why it happens:**
- Social desirability (want to look good)
- Misunderstanding that fixed mindset is "bad"
- Actually do have growth mindset but aren't challenging themselves

**Solution:**
- Emphasize: "Fixed mindset isn't a character flaw - it's a belief that can be changed"
- Model vulnerability: Share your own fixed mindset domain
- Reframe: "If you truly have growth mindset everywhere, challenge yourself to find even more growth opportunities"

---

### Challenge 2: Reframings Are Too Vague

**Symptom:** Students write "I can improve if I try hard" or "I just need to believe in myself"

**Why it happens:**
- Don't understand growth mindset requires effort + strategy + help
- Avoiding the hard work of identifying specific strategies

**Solution:**
- Stop class and model specific reframing
- Ask: "What specific actions? When? How often? Who will you learn from?"
- Use formula: "I haven't yet [current state], but I can develop this through [specific strategy 1], [specific strategy 2], and [help-seeking from X]"

---

### Challenge 3: Students Choose Irrelevant Domains for Development Plan

**Symptom:** Student with business career goals chooses to develop athletic ability

**Why it happens:**
- Easier/safer than tackling career-relevant domains
- Misunderstanding the assignment purpose

**Solution:**
- In Part 4 instructions, emphasize: "Choose domain that's actually important for your career/PDP goals"
- When circulating, ask: "How does this domain connect to your career goals?"
- Redirect: "That's interesting, but let's focus on a domain more central to your PDP. What about [suggest relevant domain]?"

---

### Challenge 4: Students Don't Include Process Metrics

**Symptom:** Part 6 only has outcome metrics ("Get 80% on exam," "Land internship")

**Why it happens:**
- Our education system emphasizes outcomes over process
- Don't understand that process metrics are controllable

**Solution:**
- Explain: "Outcome metrics measure results; process metrics measure behaviors you control"
- Ask: "What will you DO consistently? How will you track whether you're actually implementing your strategies?"
- Formula: Process metric = "Did I [specific action] [frequency]?" (Yes/No checklist)

---

### Challenge 5: Time Management (Running Over/Under)

**If Running OVER Time:**

**Cut these elements (in order):**
1. Reduce Part 2 Group Share from 8 min to 5 min (fewer groups share)
2. Reduce Part 1 Pair Share from 5 min to 3 min
3. Combine Quick Review with Part 1 (skip separate pair share at opening)
4. Provide partially completed Development Plan template (pre-fill example neuroplasticity connection)

**Do NOT cut:**
- Part 4 (Development Plan) - this is the core deliverable
- Individual reflection time - students need processing time

**If Running UNDER Time (Rare):**

**Add these elements:**
1. Additional class sharing of Development Plans (2-3 students present to class)
2. Roleof-play: Partners practice responding to setbacks with growth mindset language
3. Brief video clip from Carol Dweck TED Talk (2-3 minutes)
4. Gallery walk: Students post their reframings, class votes on most effective

---

## Cultural Sensitivity & Context

### Vietnamese Student Context

**Cultural Values to Leverage:**

1. **Education & Hard Work**
Vietnamese culture strongly values education and diligence. This aligns well with growth mindset's emphasis on effort.
- **Leverage:** "Growth mindset embodies the Vietnamese cultural value of hard work and continuous learning"

2. **Collective Success**
Emphasize that developing capabilities benefits not just individual but family, future team, and society.
- **Leverage:** "Your growth mindset helps you contribute more to your family, company, and Vietnam's economy"

3. **Respect for Authority & Expertise**
Frame help-seeking as showing respect for others' expertise, not weakness.
- **Leverage:** "Seeking feedback from mentors and experts shows respect for their knowledge - it's a strength, not weakness"

**Cultural Tensions to Navigate:**

1. **Face-Saving & Failure**
Vietnamese culture emphasizes "saving face" and avoiding public failure/embarrassment.

**Approach:**
- Frame failure as private experimentation, not public performance
- Use Vietnamese proverb: "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" (Failure is mother of success)
- Emphasize: "All successful business leaders have learned from setbacks privately"
- Keep failure discussions in pairs/small groups, not whole-class sharing unless voluntary

2. **Humility vs. Self-Promotion**
Vietnamese culture values humility; growth mindset might feel like boasting.

**Approach:**
- Frame growth mindset as realistic self-assessment, not arrogance
- "It's not about being great now - it's about being honest that you can develop"
- Emphasize process over outcome: "I'm working to develop X" (humble) vs. "I'm great at X" (boasting)

3. **Fixed Social Hierarchies**
Some students may believe abilities are predetermined by family background, social status.

**Approach:**
- Acknowledge real constraints (resources, opportunities) while emphasizing developable capabilities
- Share examples of Vietnamese business leaders who developed capabilities despite limited starting points
- "Growth mindset doesn't deny that circumstances matter - it says within your circumstances, you can develop further than you imagine"

---

## Linking to Other Course Components

### Connection to Mentorship Program

**How to Integrate:**
- "Your mentor is living proof of growth mindset - they've developed capabilities throughout their career"
- "In your next meeting, ask your mentor: 'Where have you had to shift from fixed to growth mindset in your career?'"
- "Use your mentor to practice feedback-seeking strategy - ask specific questions and receive input non-defensively"

**Suggested Mentorship Discussion Questions:**
1. "When have you had to learn a completely new skill for career advancement?"
2. "How do you respond when something is difficult or you make mistakes?"
3. "What's an area where you've developed capabilities you didn't think you had?"

### Connection to Personal Development Plan (Week 11)

**Critical Integration Points:**

1. **Goal-Setting**
"Your PDP goals should reflect growth mindset:
- Are they stretch goals that require developing NEW capabilities?
- Do they include process goals (strategies, habits) alongside outcome goals?
- Do they frame development as ongoing journey, not fixed destination?"

2. **Obstacle Planning**
"Growth mindset shapes how you plan for obstacles in your PDP:
- Anticipate setbacks as normal, not signs of failure
- Include multiple strategies (Plan A, Plan B)
- Build in feedback mechanisms"

3. **Self-Assessment Integration**
"Your MBTI, strengths, and EI results describe your STARTING POINT, not your destiny. Growth mindset means you can develop new strengths and capabilities."

### Connection to Final Oral Exam

**How Students Will Demonstrate Growth Mindset:**
- Articulate how growth mindset shaped their PDP goals
- Demonstrate understanding that development is ongoing process
- Show authentic ownership: "I'm currently developing X through Y strategies"
- Respond to Q&A with learning orientation, not defensiveness

---

## Assessment of Tutorial Learning

### How to Assess if Students "Got It"

**During Tutorial (Formative Assessment):**

✓ **Evidence of Understanding:**
- Students identify specific fixed mindset thoughts they've had
- Reframings include effort + strategy + help-seeking (not just "try harder")
- Development Plans have specific, measurable actions
- Students include both process and outcome metrics
- Strategic failure plans are concrete (not "I'll try harder")

❌ **Evidence of Misunderstanding:**
- Reframings are overly positive ("I'm great at everything!")
- Plans are vague ("I'll improve")
- Only outcome metrics, no process metrics
- No help-seeking component
- False growth mindset: "Anyone can do anything"

**After Tutorial (Follow-Up):**
- Week 11 PDP submission: Do goals reflect growth mindset framing?
- Final Oral Exam: Can students articulate how growth mindset influenced their plan?

---

## Troubleshooting Specific Situations

### Situation 1: Student Says "This Feels Fake"

**Student:** "Growth mindset just feels like lying to myself. I'm not good at public speaking - saying 'I can develop it' feels fake."

**Response:**
"I hear you. Growth mindset isn't about denying reality or forcing yourself to feel confident when you don't. It's about accurate framing. Right now, you're not confident at public speaking - that's true. The question is: Is that a permanent state or a current state? Brain science says abilities genuinely can be developed through practice. So it's actually MORE accurate to say 'I'm not confident yet' than 'I'm not confident' period. Does that distinction make sense?"

---

### Situation 2: Student Has Legitimate Constraints

**Student:** "But I genuinely don't have time to practice [skill] with my course load and part-time job."

**Response:**
"That's a real constraint, and growth mindset doesn't deny that resources and time matter. Let's think about this differently: Given your actual available time, what COULD you do? Maybe daily practice isn't realistic, but what about 15 minutes twice a week? Or one small strategy change you could implement? Growth mindset works within your realistic constraints - it's not about having unlimited time, it's about using what you have strategically."

---

### Situation 3: Student Wants to Develop Too Many Domains

**Student:** "I have fixed mindset in like 6 domains. How do I work on all of them?"

**Response:**
"Great self-awareness! But trying to develop 6 domains simultaneously will overwhelm you. Growth mindset is about sustained, focused effort - not spreading yourself thin. For this plan, choose ONE domain that's most critical for your career goals right now. You can create plans for other domains later. What's the single domain that, if you developed it, would most unlock your career potential?"

---

### Situation 4: Student Makes Unrealistic Plan

**Student writes:** "I will practice coding 4 hours daily for the next 3 months"

**Response:**
"I love your ambition, but let's make sure this plan is sustainable. Have you ever maintained a 4-hour daily practice for anything? What's a practice schedule you're 90% confident you can maintain? Remember, growth mindset is about consistent, strategic effort - not burnout. Maybe start with 30 minutes daily and scale up if that feels sustainable?"

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

### Recommended Follow-Up Actions

**Week After Tutorial:**
1. **Accountability Check:** Send class message: "Have you implemented at least ONE action from your Growth Mindset Development Plan? Share your progress or challenges in our class group."

2. **Office Hours:** Offer to review Development Plans with students who want feedback

3. **Integration with PDP:** When reviewing PDP drafts, check for growth mindset framing

**Before Final Exam:**
- Remind students that oral exam should demonstrate growth mindset: "ambitious visions of who you're becoming, not just safe predictions of who you already are"

---

## Success Stories & Examples

### Example 1: Student Who Shifted Domain-Specific Fixed Mindset

**Background:** Student believed "I'm not a technical person" but wanted marketing analytics role

**Development Plan:**
- Target: Technical/Digital domain
- Strategy: 30 min daily Python practice via Codecademy + weekly mentor check-in on progress
- Process Metrics: Completed daily practice (yes/no), asked mentor for guidance weekly
- Outcome Metrics: Week 4 - completed basic Python course; Week 8 - built simple data visualization; Week 12 - confident explaining technical concepts to non-technical people

**Result:** By semester end, student shifted from "I can't learn technical skills" to "I'm developing technical capabilities that complement my marketing creativity"

### Example 2: Student Who Learned from Strategic Failure

**Background:** Student struggled with networking (fixed mindset: "I'm too introverted for networking")

**Development Plan:**
- Strategy A: Attend 2 networking events per month, set goal of 5 meaningful conversations
- After 4 weeks: Strategy A felt overwhelming and inauthentic

**Strategic Failure Response:**
- Analyzed why: Large events triggered anxiety; forcing 5 conversations felt inauthentic
- Adjusted Strategy B: One-on-one coffee meetings with 2 professionals per month
- Result: Much more sustainable; built genuine connections

**Key Learning:** "Failure wasn't proof I couldn't network - it was feedback that I needed a different strategy aligned with my strengths"
