---

## Pre-Tutorial Preparation (Before Class)

### Materials Checklist

**Print/Prepare:**
- [ ] Mindset Self-Diagnosis handout (Activity 1) OR ensure students have notebooks
- [ ] Failure Analysis Framework template (Activity 2)—can be on handout or displayed on screen
- [ ] Reskilling Plan template (Activity 3)
- [ ] SMART goal reframing examples (Activity 4)
- [ ] Mentor Meeting #4 preparation checklist (Activity 5)
- [ ] Week 10 homework assignment handout

**Digital Setup:**
- [ ] Post supplementary resources (Dweck TED Talk, Mindset Quiz, neuroplasticity explainer)
- [ ] Ensure Mentor Meeting #4 Pre-Meeting Form is accessible on course management system
- [ ] PDP submission Google Form link is working and posted

**Room Setup:**
- [ ] Arrange chairs for small group discussions (clusters of 3-4)
- [ ] Whiteboard/projector ready for whole-class debriefs
- [ ] Timer visible (for keeping activities on track)

**Mindset Preparation:**
- [ ] Review lecture content to ensure consistency in messaging
- [ ] Prepare to model vulnerability—share your own fixed mindset triggers and failures
- [ ] Anticipate that discussing failures may be emotionally difficult for some students (Vietnamese cultural context around face-saving)
- [ ] Be ready to normalize struggle as part of growth

**Critical Reminder:**

This tutorial requires students to:
- Admit weaknesses and limitations (culturally uncomfortable in face-saving contexts)
- Analyze past failures (emotionally vulnerable)
- Acknowledge that they may not be naturally good at things important for their careers

**Your role:** Create a safe, non-judgmental space where honesty is valued and struggle is normalized.

## Detailed Activity Facilitation

---

### Activity 1: Mindset Self-Diagnosis—Finding Your Fixed Mindset Triggers (20 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual reflection/self-assessment: 12 minutes
- Small group discussion: 8 minutes
- Whole-class debrief: 2 minutes (within Activity 1 time)

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to say:**

"Today's tutorial is about honest self-assessment—probably the most important kind of work you can do for professional development.

We're going to identify where fixed mindset shows up in your thinking, analyze how you've handled past failures, and create strategic plans for developing skills you currently find challenging.

**This requires vulnerability.** You'll need to admit things you're not good at, discuss failures, and acknowledge limitations.

**Why is this valuable?** Because you can't change patterns you haven't identified. Self-awareness is the foundation of all growth.

Let's start by diagnosing your mindset patterns."

**Distribute handout or ensure students have notebooks ready.**

#### Individual Reflection (12 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"You have 12 minutes to complete the three-part self-assessment:

**Part A:** Rate how often you experience each fixed mindset pattern (1-5 scale)
**Part B:** List specific skills/subjects and identify your mindset for each
**Part C:** Deep dive on your biggest fixed mindset trigger

**Be ruthlessly honest. No one sees this unless you choose to share. The goal is self-knowledge, not looking good."

**Start timer. Maintain silence while students work.**

**Tutor role during this phase:**

- **Circulate quietly**—observe without interrupting
- **Notice students who seem stuck**—offer gentle prompts (see below)
- **Model the work yourself**—complete the assessment alongside students if possible (builds rapport and normalizes vulnerability)
- **Maintain a reflective atmosphere**—this isn't casual; it's focused introspection

**If a student seems stuck or superficial:**

**Gentle prompts:**
- "Think about a specific situation where you avoided a challenge because you feared looking incompetent. What was it?"
- "What's a skill you tell yourself you're 'just not good at'? Write that down and explore why you believe that."
- "Consider your reaction the last time you failed at something important. What did you tell yourself?"

**Cultural sensitivity note:**

Vietnamese students may be particularly reluctant to identify weaknesses or failures due to face-saving cultural norms. Frame this:

"Acknowledging areas for growth isn't admitting you're inadequate—it's demonstrating strategic self-awareness. Professional maturity means knowing both strengths AND development areas."

#### Small Group Discussion (8 minutes)

**Form groups of 3-4 students.**

**Instructions:**

"In your groups, you'll discuss three things—about 2-3 minutes each:

**1. Share your biggest fixed mindset trigger** (from Part C)—the domain that most limits your career potential. You don't have to share all your reflection, just the skill/subject and why it matters. (3 minutes)

**2. Peer coaching:** For each person who shares, the group offers evidence that contradicts their fixed mindset, encouragement, and suggestions for first steps. (3 minutes)

**3. Pattern recognition:** What common fixed mindset triggers did your group identify? (2 minutes)

**I'll time you and let you know when to move to the next question.**"

**Tutor role:**

- **Circulate actively**—listen to discussions, note themes
- **Encourage depth:** If you hear surface-level sharing, prompt: "Can you give a specific example of how this fixed mindset has held you back?"
- **Facilitate peer support:** If a group focuses on negativity, redirect: "Now offer some evidence that contradicts this fixed mindset—what has this person successfully learned despite initial difficulty?"
- **Note common patterns to highlight in debrief:** (e.g., "Many of you said 'technical skills' or 'public speaking'")
- **Time-check verbally:**
  - After 3 min: "Move to peer coaching—offer evidence and encouragement"
  - After 6 min: "Final question—what patterns do you notice?"

**Listen for these common fixed mindset triggers in Vietnamese BBAE students:**

- **Technical/quantitative skills:** "I'm not good at data analysis/coding/statistics"
- **Public speaking/presentations:** "I'm too shy/introverted to present well"
- **English proficiency:** "My English isn't good enough for professional settings"
- **Networking/relationship-building:** "I'm not naturally outgoing"
- **Creativity/innovation:** "I'm more analytical, not creative"

**Be prepared to normalize these and offer growth mindset reframes in debrief.**

#### Whole-Class Debrief (2 minutes)

**Bring class together:**

"Let's hear some patterns. What fixed mindset triggers came up in your groups?"

**Facilitate brief sharing (2-3 groups):**

**Listen for and highlight:**
- Common domains (likely: technical skills, public speaking, networking)
- Themes (comparison to others, early negative experiences, external messaging)

**Key points to emphasize:**

"Here's what I want you to take from this activity:

**1. You're not broken if you have fixed mindset triggers. Everyone does.**

**Even Carol Dweck—the researcher who discovered growth mindset—has domains where her fixed mindset shows up.**

**2. The difference between people who develop and people who stagnate:**
- **Awareness:** Recognizing when fixed mindset operates
- **Intervention:** Actively reframing and choosing growth-oriented responses
- **Practice:** Repeatedly choosing challenge over comfort

**3. Fixed mindset is loudest in domains that matter most for your goals.**

If you don't care about a skill, you don't develop fixed mindset about it. The fact that you identified these triggers means these skills are important for your career—which makes the work of shifting to growth mindset even more valuable.

**Save this assessment. You'll use it for your PDP and Mentor Meeting #4.**"

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student rates everything low (harsh self-criticism) | Normalize: "Self-awareness includes recognizing strengths, not just weaknesses. Where DO you demonstrate growth mindset?" |
| Student rates everything high (defensive, avoids vulnerability) | Probe gently: "Everyone has some fixed mindset triggers. Think of a time you avoided a challenge because you feared failure." |
| Student struggles to identify any fixed mindset patterns | Ask: "When you face something difficult, what's your first thought—'I can learn this' or 'I'm not good at this type of thing'?" |
| Student identifies trigger but can't articulate why it matters for career | Connect explicitly: "How does avoiding [skill] limit your career options? What opportunities are you missing?" |
| Group discussion stays surface-level | Intervene with deeper prompts: "Go beyond naming the skill—discuss how this mindset has actually affected your choices and opportunities." |

### Activity 2: Failure Autopsy—Learning from Past Setbacks (25 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual reflection and framework application: 15 minutes
- Pair-share discussion: 10 minutes
- (No separate whole-class debrief; key takeaway embedded at end)

#### Setup (2 minutes)

**What to say:**

"We're about to do something most people avoid: deliberately examining a failure.

**Why do people avoid this?**
- Painful emotions
- Threats to self-esteem
- Fear of dwelling on negativity
- Uncertainty about how to extract useful insights

**But here's the truth: Failure is one of the most powerful learning experiences—if you extract the lessons.**

Today you'll do a structured **failure autopsy.** This isn't about feeling bad. It's about transforming a setback into strategic insights and actionable next steps.

**The framework you're using is the 5-step Failure Analysis Framework from lecture:**
1. Describe objectively
2. Analyze strategically
3. Extract lessons
4. Adjust strategy
5. Persist with new approach

**You're going to apply this to a real setback from the past year.**"

**Distribute Failure Analysis Framework template (or display on screen/board).**

#### Cultural Sensitivity Framing (Important!)

**Add this:**

"I know Vietnamese culture emphasizes success and can make discussing failure uncomfortable—it feels like losing face.

**But consider this reframe:**

**Avoiding reflection on failure = staying stuck in old patterns**

**Analyzing failure strategically = demonstrating professional maturity**

**Employers value resilience and learning agility as much as success. The ability to fail, learn, and improve is a competitive advantage.**

We're doing this in a safe, confidential space. What you write is private unless you choose to share."

#### Individual Reflection and Writing (15 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"Take 15 minutes to work through the framework. I'll guide you through the steps:

**Step 1 (2 min):** Select a specific setback from the past year and describe what happened

**Step 2 (2 min):** Identify your initial response—how did you react emotionally and behaviorally?

**Step 3 (8 min):** Apply the framework—answer parts A through E thoroughly

**Step 4 (2 min):** Write your growth mindset reframe

**Step 5 (1 min):** Commit to specific next action

**Work independently. Be honest and specific.**"

**Start timer.**

**Tutor role during this phase:**

- **Maintain focused atmosphere**—this is deep, potentially emotional work
- **Circulate and observe**—watch for students who seem stuck or distressed
- **Offer prompts if needed** (see below)
- **Model vulnerability**—if appropriate, share (briefly) a failure you've analyzed using this framework
- **Time-check verbally** at each transition point

**If a student seems stuck:**

**Prompts by step:**

**Step 1 (selecting setback):**
- "Think of a time you tried something and it didn't work out—a failed exam, rejected application, conflict with teammate, missed opportunity."
- "The setback doesn't have to be catastrophic—even a moderate disappointment works for this exercise."

**Step 2 (initial response):**
- "Be honest about how you actually responded—not how you wish you had responded."
- "Did you blame yourself? Make excuses? Avoid thinking about it? Give up on related goals?"

**Step 3A (objective description):**
- "Stick to facts. 'I scored 60%' not 'I'm terrible at this subject.'"

**Step 3B (strategic analysis):**
- "Controllable factors = things YOU could have influenced: effort, strategy, preparation, time management"
- "Uncontrollable factors = things outside your control: other people's decisions, circumstances, bad luck"

**Step 3C (extracting lessons):**
- "What does this setback teach you about your approach? Your assumptions? What you need to develop?"

**Step 3D (adjusting strategy):**
- "Be specific. Not 'try harder' but 'study using active recall instead of passive reading' or 'practice interview questions with a friend weekly.'"

**Step 3E (next action):**
- "What's ONE concrete thing you'll do differently based on this learning?"

**Step 4 (growth mindset reframe):**
- "Original interpretation was probably fixed mindset: 'This proves I'm not good at X.' Reframe: 'This taught me Y, and my next step is Z.'"

**If a student appears emotionally affected:**

Some students may feel upset revisiting a painful failure. This is normal.

**Responses:**
- Acknowledge privately: "I can see this is bringing up difficult feelings. That's okay. The point is learning, not re-traumatizing."
- Offer choice: "If this failure feels too raw right now, you can choose a different, less emotionally charged setback."
- Normalize: "Failure hurts. That's human. But we're transforming that pain into strategic growth."

**Cultural note on shame:**

If a student's failure involved public embarrassment (common fear in face-saving cultures), validate:

"Public failures are especially painful. But remember: the people who witnessed it have likely forgotten or don't care nearly as much as you think. You're the only one still dwelling on it—which means you have the power to reframe it."

#### Pair-Share Discussion (10 minutes)

**Form pairs (not same groups as Activity 1—mix it up).**

**Instructions:**

"Find a partner. You'll:

**1. Share your failure and your growth mindset reframe** (not all the details—just the situation and your reframe). 4 minutes total, 2 min each.

**2. Peer feedback:** (4 minutes total)
- Is the reframe authentically growth-oriented, or does it still contain fixed mindset thinking?
- Are the strategy adjustments specific and actionable?
- What additional insights might this failure offer?

**3. Mutual accountability:** (2 minutes)
Exchange commitments from Step 3E. Agree to check in with each other in 1 week about progress.

**I'm asking you to share something vulnerable. You can decline if it's too personal, but I encourage openness—your peer likely has similar experiences.**"

**Tutor role:**

- **Circulate and listen actively**—this is sensitive content
- **Monitor for authentic sharing vs. superficial**—gently encourage depth if needed
- **Watch for dismissive responses**—redirect if peers aren't taking each other seriously
- **Affirm vulnerability:** If you overhear authentic, vulnerable sharing, acknowledge it: "That took courage to share. Thank you."
- **Time-check verbally:**
  - After 4 min: "Move to peer feedback—is the reframe truly growth-oriented?"
  - After 8 min: "Final step—exchange commitments and accountability"

**Listen for these common issues in reframes:**

**❌ Still fixed mindset:**
- "This failure taught me I'm just not cut out for this field" (still identity-based)
- "This failure taught me to avoid similar challenges in the future" (avoidance)
- "This failure was entirely due to bad luck/unfair circumstances" (no ownership)

**✅ Authentic growth mindset:**
- "This failure taught me my study strategy was ineffective; I need active practice, not passive reading"
- "This failure taught me I need to develop presentation skills through repeated practice with feedback"
- "This failure taught me I underestimated the preparation required; next time I'll start 2 weeks earlier"

**If you hear ❌ examples, intervene gently:**

"I'm hearing some fixed mindset still in that reframe. Let's push further: What specific strategy could you adjust? What would you do differently next time?"

#### Key Takeaway (2 minutes—embedded at end of Activity 2)

**After pair-shares conclude, bring class back together briefly:**

"The setback you just analyzed probably felt terrible when it happened. But through structured reflection, you've transformed it into:
- Strategic insights
- Specific improvements
- Actionable next steps

**This is the difference between failure that defeats you and failure that develops you.**

Sara Blakely, Angela Duckworth, Carol Dweck—every successful person you admire has failed repeatedly. The difference: they treated failure as feedback, not identity.

**For your PDP:** Include examples of how you've learned from failure. Employers value resilience and growth orientation as much as success.

**Also:** If you and your partner committed to mutual accountability, follow through. Check in with each other next week. Accountability accelerates growth."

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student chooses trivial failure (avoids real vulnerability) | Probe: "Is there a more significant setback that would offer richer learning? The more meaningful the failure, the more valuable the analysis." |
| Student blames failure entirely on external factors | Challenge gently: "External factors matter, but were there ANY controllable elements? What could you have influenced even slightly?" |
| Student's "lesson" is just vague platitude ("I learned to work harder") | Push for specificity: "What does 'work harder' mean specifically? What strategy will you change?" |
| Student's reframe is still fixed mindset | Point it out: "I'm still hearing 'I'm not good at this' rather than 'I haven't mastered this yet.' Try again with different language." |
| Student becomes defensive when peer offers feedback | Intervene: "Feedback is a gift. Listen with openness—your partner is trying to help you grow." |
| Pairs finish early and chat casually | Redirect: "If you've finished, go deeper. What other failures have you analyzed this way? What patterns do you notice in how you respond to setbacks?" |

### Activity 3: Reskilling Plan Development—Preparing for Your Field's Future (20 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual work: 15 minutes
- Small group sharing: 5 minutes
- (Key takeaway embedded at end)

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to say:**

"Growth mindset isn't just about current challenges—it's about preparing for future ones.

**The reality:** The skills you're learning at NEU will change. Some will become less valuable (automation, AI). New skills you haven't even heard of yet will become essential.

**This is where growth mindset becomes career-survival critical.**

You're going to create a preliminary reskilling plan for your career field. This will:
- Identify skills your field will likely need in 3-5 years
- Assess your current gaps
- Plan how you'll develop those skills
- Anticipate fixed mindset challenges you'll face

**This becomes part of your PDP next week.**"

**Distribute Reskilling Plan template or ensure students have the framework from lecture.**

#### Individual Work (15 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"You have 15 minutes to work through Parts A-D:

**Part A (3 min):** Analyze your career field—current skills, emerging skills, skills at risk

**Part B (3 min):** Personal gap analysis—compare your current level to future needs

**Part C (7 min):** Strategic reskilling plan for your top 3 priority skills

**Part D (2 min):** Accountability and support systems

**Work individually. Be strategic and specific.**"

**Start timer.**

**Tutor role during this phase:**

- **Circulate and provide field-specific guidance**—many students may not know what skills will be needed in their field
- **Encourage research-based thinking**—connect to Week 1-2 content on future of work
- **Challenge "I can't learn that" thinking in real-time**—this activity will surface fixed mindset about technical skills
- **Time-check verbally** at each part transition

**Common questions and responses:**

| Student Question | Tutor Response |
|------------------|----------------|
| "How do I know what skills my field will need in 3-5 years?" | "Think about trends: AI integration, data-driven decision-making, automation. Also recall Week 1 WEF report. What's happening in your industry now that will accelerate?" |
| "I don't have a specific career field yet." | "Choose 2-3 fields you're considering and analyze one. Or pick a broad category like 'marketing' or 'finance' and focus there." |
| "All the emerging skills seem technical—I'm not a technical person." | "This is exactly the fixed mindset trap. You don't need to become a software engineer. You need AI literacy and data fluency. That's developable." |
| "How do I rate my current level if I've never even tried the skill?" | "If you've never engaged with it, you're probably a 1. That's okay—that's your starting point." |
| "Three skills is too many to develop!" | "You're not developing them simultaneously. This is a 3-5 year plan. Prioritize and sequence." |

**Watch for fixed mindset language emerging:**

Students will likely write things like:
- "I'm not technical, so I can't learn Python"
- "Data analysis isn't my strength"
- "I'm more creative, not analytical"

**Intervene immediately when you see this:**

"I'm seeing fixed mindset language. Remember: these skills are developable. Reframe using 'I haven't learned this yet' instead of 'I can't.'"

**Part C (Strategic Reskilling Plan) is most important:**

**For each skill, students must address:**
- Growth mindset challenge (fixed mindset self-talk they'll face)
- Growth mindset reframe
- Learning strategy (resources, practice opportunities, timeline)
- Success metric

**Ensure students are specific:**

**❌ Vague:**
- "I'll learn AI by taking online courses"

**✅ Specific:**
- "I'll complete Google's AI Essentials course by March 2026, practice by using ChatGPT daily for work tasks, and measure success by ability to engineer effective prompts that save me 2+ hours per week"

#### Small Group Sharing (5 minutes)

**Form groups of 3-4.**

**Instructions:**

"In your groups, each person shares:

1. Your career field and top priority reskilling skill
2. The fixed mindset challenge you anticipate
3. Your growth mindset reframe

**Group provides:**
- Encouragement that the skill is developable
- Resource suggestions (courses, books, people to learn from)
- Shared accountability (exchange contact if helpful)

You have 5 minutes—about 1 minute per person."

**Tutor role:**

- **Circulate and listen for insights**—note creative learning strategies to highlight later
- **Encourage peer support**—groups should be cheerleading each other's development
- **Intervene if you hear dismissiveness**—"That's too hard" or "You'll never learn that"—redirect to growth mindset
- **Time-check:** "1 minute left—make sure everyone has shared"

**Listen for common skills that emerge:**

Likely priorities for BBAE students:
- AI literacy / prompt engineering
- Data analysis / Excel/Python basics
- Digital marketing tools
- Public speaking / presentation skills
- Cross-cultural communication

**If these patterns emerge, note them for transition to Activity 4.**

#### Key Takeaway (1 minute—embedded at end of Activity 3)

**Bring class back together briefly:**

"What you just created is a draft of the **reskilling component** of your PDP.

**This isn't optional or 'nice to have'—it's essential.**

By 2030, half of all workers will need significant reskilling. You're ahead of the curve because you're planning for it NOW.

**Two mindset realities:**

**Fixed mindset makes reskilling terrifying:**
- "I'm too old to learn new tech"
- "I'm not that type of person"
- "My degree should be enough"
→ Career stagnation, obsolescence risk

**Growth mindset makes reskilling exciting:**
- "I can learn these skills through strategic effort"
- "Continuous learning is professional life now"
- "Each new skill expands my opportunities"
→ Career adaptability, competitive advantage

**Your choice.**"

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student identifies emerging skills but can't think of learning strategies | Offer prompts: "Online courses? Mentorship? Hands-on projects? Certifications? Peer learning groups?" |
| Student's timeline is unrealistic (too ambitious or too slow) | Calibrate: "Learning basic AI literacy in 1 month is ambitious. Learning it over 6 months with consistent weekly practice is achievable." |
| Student treats this as hypothetical exercise, not real planning | Make it concrete: "This goes directly into your PDP. You're committing to these skills. Make it realistic." |
| Student only focuses on skills they're already good at | Challenge: "Part of reskilling is developing skills OUTSIDE your comfort zone. Where are the stretch goals?" |
| Student overwhelmed by number of skills needed | Prioritize: "You can't develop everything at once. What's the ONE skill that would most accelerate your career in the next year? Start there." |

### Activity 4: SMART Goal Reframing—Growth Mindset in Action (15 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual work: 10 minutes
- Pair-share peer review: 5 minutes
- (Key takeaway embedded at end)

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to say:**

"Your PDP is due next week. Every goal you write must reflect growth mindset.

**Fixed mindset goals:**
- Minimize risk
- Avoid challenge
- Protect current self-image
- Limit you to what you already can do

**Growth mindset goals:**
- Embrace strategic challenge
- Focus on who you're becoming
- Expand your capabilities

Today you're going to practice translating fixed mindset goals into growth mindset SMART goals.

**This is the language you'll use in your PDP.**"

**Display or distribute examples of fixed vs. growth mindset goals.**

#### Individual Work (10 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"You have 10 minutes to:

1. Reframe the 4 example goals provided (from fixed mindset to growth mindset SMART goals)
2. Write one of your own actual 1-year PDP goals
3. Check it for fixed mindset language and revise

**Keys to growth mindset SMART goals:**
- Embrace challenge (don't avoid difficulty)
- Focus on development (not just achievement)
- Specific about strategies (not just outcomes)
- Recognize skills as developable (not fixed traits)

**Work independently. This is PDP practice.**"

**Start timer.**

**Tutor role during this phase:**

- **Circulate and review student goals over shoulders**—offer real-time feedback
- **Point out fixed mindset language**—help students catch and correct it
- **Ensure goals are truly SMART**—specificity is often missing
- **Encourage ambition within realism**—goals should stretch, not overwhelm

**Common issues and in-the-moment coaching:**

**Issue: Goal is vague**

Example: "Improve communication skills"

**Coaching:** "Make this specific. What kind of communication? How will you measure improvement? By when? What actions will you take?"

**Better:** "Develop professional presentation skills by presenting in 5 class/work settings by June 2026, seeking feedback after each, and joining Toastmasters by March 2026 to practice weekly"

**Issue: Goal contains avoidance language**

Example: "Find a marketing role that doesn't require data analysis"

**Coaching:** "This is fixed mindset—avoiding challenge. Reframe: How could you develop basic data literacy to expand your options?"

**Better:** "Develop basic data analysis skills by completing Google Data Analytics certificate by December 2026, enabling me to qualify for data-informed marketing roles"

**Issue: Goal focuses only on leveraging existing strengths**

Example: "Get a job using my natural creativity"

**Coaching:** "Leveraging strengths is good, but growth mindset also develops weaknesses. Where's your stretch goal?"

**Better:** "Combine my creative strengths with developing quantitative skills—complete marketing analytics course by May 2026 so I can create data-driven campaigns"

**Issue: Goal assumes talent is fixed**

Example: "Work in roles that suit my personality type (INTJ)"

**Coaching:** "Personality preferences don't limit what you can DO, just what's naturally comfortable. How can you expand your capabilities?"

**Better:** "Develop collaborative skills (currently outside my INTJ comfort zone) by leading 2 team projects and seeking feedback on teamwork by November 2026"

**Walk around and give quick feedback verbally:**

- "I'm seeing fixed mindset language here—'I can't' or 'I'm not good at.' Revise."
- "This goal is SMART. Now make sure the language emphasizes development, not just achievement."
- "Great reframe! This shows growth orientation."

#### Pair-Share Peer Review (5 minutes)

**Form pairs.**

**Instructions:**

"Exchange your goal #5 (your actual PDP goal).

**Peer review using these questions:**
1. Is it truly SMART? (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
2. Does it reflect growth mindset? (Embraces challenge, focuses on development)
3. Does it avoid fixed mindset traps? (No avoidance, no 'I can't' thinking)
4. Is it ambitious enough? (Challenges you without being unrealistic)

**Provide specific suggestions for improvement.**

Then revise based on feedback.

You have 5 minutes—2.5 min per person."

**Tutor role:**

- **Circulate and listen to peer feedback**—ensure it's constructive, not just affirming
- **Model good feedback:** If you overhear weak peer feedback, intervene with better prompts
- **Encourage revision:** "Don't just listen to feedback—actually revise your goal right now"
- **Time-check:** After 2.5 min, "Switch—second person's turn for feedback"

**Listen for quality of peer feedback:**

**❌ Weak peer feedback:**
- "Looks good!" (no specific input)
- "I don't know, seems fine" (not engaged)

**✅ Strong peer feedback:**
- "This is SMART except the timeline is vague—specify a month, not just 'next year'"
- "I'm seeing some avoidance here—instead of 'find a role without X,' could you develop X skill?"
- "This is great but maybe not ambitious enough—you could stretch further"

**If you hear weak feedback, model better:**

"Let me give you an example of stronger feedback: 'Your goal says you'll improve public speaking, but HOW? Add specific actions—like joining Toastmasters or presenting monthly in class.'"

#### Key Takeaway (1 minute—embedded at end of Activity 4)

**Bring class back together briefly:**

"Goal-setting is where mindset becomes visible.

**When you write your PDP next week, every single goal should reflect growth mindset:**
- Embrace challenge
- Focus on development
- Use 'I will develop/learn/build' language instead of 'I am/I'm good at/I should avoid'

**Use the language and framing you practiced today.**

**Also:** Notice how peer feedback helps. When you're blind to your own fixed mindset language, others can spot it. Consider having a friend review your full PDP before submitting."

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student's goal is entirely focused on achievement, not learning | Reframe: "That's an outcome goal. What's the learning goal underneath? What skills will you develop?" |
| Student writes multiple goals, all in comfort zone | Challenge: "Where's your stretch goal? What skill that currently feels difficult will you develop?" |
| Student's goal is unrealistic | Calibrate: "This is ambitious, which is good. But is it achievable in the timeframe? What's a realistic version?" |
| Peer feedback is too nice/non-critical | Intervene: "Your job as peer reviewer is to push your partner to excellence. Point out weaknesses constructively." |
| Student resistant to revising goal based on feedback | Explore: "What's making you resistant? Does this feedback challenge a fixed mindset belief?" |

### Activity 5: Mentor Meeting #4 Preparation—PDP Review Focus (10 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual planning: 7 minutes
- Brief pair-share: 3 minutes
- (Key takeaway embedded at end)

#### Setup (1 minute)

**What to say:**

"Your 4th and final required mentorship meeting is coming up in the next 2 weeks.

**Meeting #4's focus: PDP review.**

This is arguably your most important mentorship meeting because:
- It directly informs your PDP (worth 40% of your grade)
- It's your last chance to get mentor guidance before the November 28 deadline
- Mentor feedback must be evidenced in your PDP (worth 20% of PDP grade)

**To maximize this meeting, you need to prepare strategically.**

Today you're going to plan what to bring, what questions to ask, and how you'll use the feedback."

#### Individual Planning (7 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"Take 7 minutes to work through the preparation checklist:

**Part A:** Check off materials you'll bring to Meeting #4
**Part B:** Write at least 5 strategic questions for your mentor (use the provided categories)
**Part C:** Preview what your Pre-Meeting Preparation Form should include
**Part D:** Commit to action after the meeting

**Be specific. This is real planning for a real meeting happening in the next 2 weeks.**"

**Start timer.**

**Tutor role during this phase:**

- **Circulate and review questions students are writing**—ensure they're strategic, not superficial
- **Connect to previous activities:** "Your mindset self-assessment from Activity 1? Bring it. Your reskilling plan from Activity 3? Bring it."
- **Emphasize urgency:** "Many of you should schedule this meeting THIS week to leave time for revisions"
- **Help students craft better questions** (see below)

**Common weak questions and how to improve them:**

**❌ Weak question:**
"What do you think of my PDP?"

**Why weak:** Too vague; doesn't guide mentor to specific feedback

**✅ Strong question:**
"Looking at my 5-year goals, do they seem realistic but challenging? Am I being too conservative or too ambitious?"

---

**❌ Weak question:**
"Do you have any advice for me?"

**Why weak:** Puts burden on mentor to guess what you need

**✅ Strong question:**
"I struggle with [specific skill]. How did you develop competency in this area when it wasn't your natural strength?"

---

**❌ Weak question:**
"What's your job like?"

**Why weak:** Doesn't connect to PDP or your development

**✅ Strong question:**
"What skills do you use most in your current role that you didn't anticipate needing when you started your career?"

---

**Walk around and coach in real-time:**

"This question is too general—make it specific to your PDP."

"Great question! This will give you actionable feedback."

"I notice all your questions are about your field, but none about mindset or resilience. Add at least one from that category."

**Ensure students address all categories:**

Check that each student has questions about:
1. Mindset/resilience (failure, setbacks)
2. Reskilling/adaptability (learning new skills mid-career)
3. Goal-setting/planning (PDP feedback)
4. Field-specific insights
5. Their draft plans (specific feedback)

**Part D is critical—action commitment:**

Students must commit to:
- Revising PDP based on mentor feedback
- Sending thank-you message
- Referencing mentor's influence in final PDP

**Emphasize:** "You're required to show evidence of mentor influence in your PDP. Take detailed notes during Meeting #4 so you can cite specific advice."

#### Brief Pair-Share (3 minutes)

**Form pairs.**

**Instructions:**

"Share with your partner:
1. One question you're planning to ask your mentor
2. One area of your PDP you most want feedback on

**Peer provides:** Is there an even better question you could ask?"

**Tutor role:**

- **Listen for quality of questions**—note excellent examples to share
- **Encourage specificity:** "Could you make that question more specific to your field or goals?"
- **Time-check:** "1.5 minutes each"

#### Key Takeaway (2 minutes—embedded at end of Activity 5)

**Bring class together:**

"Mentor Meeting #4 is your most important meeting.

**To get maximum value:**

**1. Don't show up empty-handed.**
Bring a draft PDP—even if incomplete. "I haven't started yet" wastes the meeting.

**2. Ask specific questions, not 'What do you think?'**
Strategic questions get strategic answers.

**3. Take detailed notes.**
You'll incorporate feedback immediately into your PDP, and you must evidence mentor influence (20% of PDP grade).

**Practical timeline:**

**This week or next (Week 10):** Schedule and complete Meeting #4

**Why urgency matters:**
- PDP due November 28 (end of Week 11)
- You need time to revise based on mentor feedback
- Don't wait until November 27 and realize you haven't met with your mentor yet

**Submit Pre-Meeting Form 48 hours before. Submit Post-Meeting Reflection 48 hours after.**

**Your mentor has agreed to help you. Honor their time by being prepared.**"

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Student hasn't started PDP yet (nothing to bring to meeting) | Urgent intervention: "Start this week. Even a rough draft is better than nothing. Your mentor can't give feedback on a blank page." |
| Student's questions are all generic | Push for specificity: "Tailor questions to YOUR field, YOUR goals, YOUR development areas." |
| Student focused only on getting approval, not critical feedback | Reframe: "Your mentor's job isn't to make you feel good—it's to challenge you to grow. Ask where you're being too conservative." |
| Student hasn't scheduled meeting yet | Action now: "Pull out your phone and email your mentor right now to suggest 3 specific times for Meeting #4." |
| Student unclear what "evidence of mentor influence" means | Clarify: "In your PDP, explicitly reference: 'My mentor advised X, so I adjusted my goal to Y' or 'Meeting #4 discussion about Z led me to prioritize this skill.'" |

## Closing Reflection: Committing to Growth (5 minutes)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Individual reflection: 4 minutes
- Optional sharing: 1 minute

#### Individual Reflection (4 minutes)

**Instructions:**

"We've done intensive self-assessment work today. Take 4 minutes to consolidate your learning.

Write responses to these three prompts:

**1. What's the most important insight you gained about yourself today?**

(Related to mindset, failure, reskilling, goal-setting)

**2. What's one specific fixed mindset pattern you commit to changing?**

(From Activity 1—your biggest trigger)

How will you intervene when you notice this pattern?

**3. What's one concrete action you'll take this week to apply growth mindset?**

Examples:
- Start learning a challenging skill
- Seek feedback you've been avoiding
- Reframe a goal
- Schedule Mentor Meeting #4

**Action:** ___
**By when:** ___
**Accountability:** Who will you tell?

**Work silently and honestly.**"

**Start timer.**

**Tutor role:**

- **Write alongside students**—model reflective practice
- **Maintain silence**—this is personal consolidation time
- **Circulate and observe**—note themes for potential sharing
- **Watch for students finishing early**—prompt: "Go deeper. What's underneath that insight? What will it take to actually change this pattern?"

**After 4 minutes:**

#### Optional Sharing (1 minute)

**If time permits and class culture supports it:**

"Would anyone like to share their commitment? This is optional, but public commitment increases accountability."

**Invite 2-3 volunteers.**

**Affirm each share:**
- "That takes courage to commit to publicly. Thank you."
- "Excellent—specific action with timeline. That's growth mindset in practice."

**If no one volunteers:**

"That's fine. These commitments are personal. But I encourage you to share them with someone—your mentor, a friend, your accountability partner from Activity 2. Public commitment is powerful."

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Students reluctant to identify failures or weaknesses

**Causes:**
- Vietnamese cultural norms around face-saving
- Fear of judgment from peers
- Shame about past setbacks

**Solutions:**
- Model vulnerability yourself (share your own failures and fixed mindset triggers)
- Emphasize privacy: "What you write is private unless you choose to share"
- Reframe: "Acknowledging weaknesses isn't inadequacy—it's strategic self-awareness"
- Normalize: "Everyone has failed. Everyone has fixed mindset triggers. This is human."

### Issue: Activity timing is off (running over)

**Causes:**
- Students need more time for deep reflection than anticipated
- Failure autopsy is emotionally complex
- Group discussions go deep

**Solutions:**
- **If running over:** Shorten Activity 5 (Mentor Meeting prep)—this can be covered in email/handout
- **If finishing early:** Extend reflection time or facilitate whole-class discussion on patterns

### Issue: Students treat growth mindset as "just positive thinking"

**Causes:**
- Misunderstanding from popular culture
- Oversimplification of concepts
- Avoidance of real strategy work

**Solutions:**
- Call it out: "Growth mindset isn't positive affirmations. It's strategic effort + effective strategies + seeking help"
- Require specific action plans: "Don't just say 'I can learn this'—HOW will you learn it? What resources? What timeline?"
- Reference lecture content: "Remember Dweck's warning about false growth mindset"

### Issue: Students overwhelmed by reskilling demands

**Causes:**
- Genuine anxiety about rapid change
- Fixed mindset fear about learning technical skills
- Underestimation of own learning capacity

**Solutions:**
- Normalize: "Yes, the pace of change is faster than previous generations faced. That's reality. But you CAN adapt."
- Break it down: "You don't reskill all at once. One skill at a time, over years."
- Ground in evidence: "You've already learned difficult things—English, university-level content, complex concepts. You have proven learning capacity."

### Issue: Students write PDP goals focused only on current strengths (avoiding challenge)

**Causes:**
- Persistent fixed mindset despite today's content
- Risk-aversion
- Misunderstanding of what development means

**Solutions:**
- Challenge directly: "All your goals leverage existing strengths. Where are your stretch goals? What skills outside your comfort zone will you develop?"
- Connect to lecture: "Growth mindset means embracing challenge, not just polishing what you're already good at"
- Ask: "If you only do things you're already good at, how will you grow?"

### Issue: Students haven't started PDP despite deadline being 2 weeks away

**Causes:**
- Procrastination
- Overwhelm (don't know where to start)
- Waiting for Meeting #4 feedback

**Solutions:**
- Create urgency: "PDP due November 28. That's 14 days. You need Meeting #4 feedback before finalizing, which means meeting in next 7 days and revising in second 7 days."
- Break down: "Start with what you have—self-assessments. Write the self-knowledge section this week."
- Action commitment: "Before you leave today, open your calendar and block PDP work time."

## Alignment with Course Assessments

### How Today's Tutorial Connects to Assessments

**Individual Assignment—Reflective Essay (10%):**
- Failure Analysis Framework (Activity 2) is same reflective process students will use for analyzing field trip and guest speaker
- Practice connecting experiences to course concepts (growth mindset)
- Prepares for extracting insights from upcoming guest speaker (Week 10)

**Mentorship Program (20%):**
- Activity 5 (Meeting #4 prep) directly supports successful mentorship meeting
- Mindset self-assessment and reskilling plan provide content for discussion with mentor
- Students practice formulating strategic questions for professionals

**Personal Development Plan (40%):**
- Activity 1 (mindset self-diagnosis) = foundation for SWOT analysis and self-awareness section
- Activity 2 (failure autopsy) = evidence of resilience and learning from setbacks
- Activity 3 (reskilling plan) = critical component of PDP's skills development section
- Activity 4 (SMART goal reframing) = direct practice for 1-year, 3-year, 5-year goals in PDP
- All activities produce content that should be incorporated into PDP draft this week

**Final Oral Exam (30%):**
- Students practice articulating growth mindset in their career approach
- Preparation for discussing how they'll handle challenges and setbacks (likely Q&A topic)
- Language practice: speaking about development, not just achievement

## Cultural Considerations for Vietnamese Context

### Face-Saving and Discussing Failure

**Context:** Vietnamese culture emphasizes saving face; discussing failures publicly can feel shameful.

**Implication for today's tutorial:**
- Activity 2 (Failure Autopsy) requires students to analyze setbacks—culturally uncomfortable
- Students may choose trivial failures to avoid real vulnerability
- Pair-sharing failures may feel risky

**Tutor approach:**
- Emphasize privacy first: "What you write is private"
- Reframe failure as learning opportunity, not character flaw
- Model vulnerability yourself (share your own failure analysis)
- Allow choice: "If a failure feels too personal, choose a different one"
- Cultural bridge: Reference Vietnamese proverb "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" (Failure is the mother of success)

### Humility vs. Self-Promotion

**Context:** Vietnamese cultural norms value humility; identifying strengths can feel like bragging.

**Implication for today's tutorial:**
- Students may underrate themselves in mindset self-assessment
- May struggle with "growth mindset" framing that sounds self-promotional
- May avoid ambitious goal-setting (appears arrogant)

**Tutor approach:**
- Frame strategic self-awareness as professional skill, not arrogance
- Emphasize: "Knowing your strengths helps you contribute effectively—it's not bragging, it's strategic"
- Distinguish humility (accurate self-view) from false modesty (underrating abilities)
- Encourage ambition within cultural norms: "Setting challenging goals shows respect for your potential and your family's investment in your education"

### Collectivism and Personal Development

**Context:** Vietnamese culture is collectivist; Western "personal development" can feel individualistic.

**Implication for today's tutorial:**
- Students may frame growth in terms of family/community expectations, not personal desires
- PDP goals may reflect "what my family wants" more than "what I want"

**Tutor approach:**
- Validate collectivist values: "Your career can honor both personal passions AND family expectations"
- Reframe personal growth as service: "When you develop yourself, you can contribute more to your family and community"
- Acknowledge tension: "It's okay if your goals include both personal fulfillment and family responsibility"

---

## Resources and Support

### For Students Who Need Extra Support

**Students anxious about career change/reskilling:**
- Normalize: "Everyone feels uncertain about rapid change—it's rational, not weakness"
- Provide structure: "Reskilling isn't random—you have a plan now (Activity 3)"
- Connect to resources: "Your mentor has navigated change—ask them how"

**Students who failed significantly and feel stuck:**
- Validate emotions: "Failure hurts. That's real. But it doesn't define you."
- Emphasize changeability: "You can learn from this and move forward with new strategy"
- Offer private conversation: "If you want to discuss this more, I'm available"

**Students who don't have clear career direction yet:**
- Reassure: "You don't need perfect clarity to apply growth mindset. The mindset applies to any path."
- Encourage exploration: "Try reskilling planning for 2-3 fields you're considering"
- Frame positively: "Not having one fixed path is actually alignment with growth mindset—you're open to possibilities"

### For Tutors

**If you need support:**
- **Course coordinator:** [Instructor name and email]
- **Mentorship coordinators:** Le Huong Lan, William Winterton Lang, Nguyễn Đức Nhật Anh, Đào Ngọc Diệp
- **Teaching resources:** Assessment Handbook, lecture slides, course readings, Week 9 research file

**Recommended reflection practice:**
- Keep teaching journal—what worked, what didn't, student insights
- Notice your own fixed mindset triggers as you teach this content (models growth mindset)
- Debrief with other tutors—share strategies for handling sensitive topics like failure
