  <layout>TWO_COLUMN</layout>
  <title>Two Theories of Intelligence</title>
  <left_column>
    **Fixed Mindset**
    • Intelligence is static
    • You have a certain amount and that's it
    • Success comes from proving your ability
    • Challenges reveal your limitations
  </left_column>
  <right_column>
    **Growth Mindset**
    • Intelligence can be developed
    • Abilities grow through effort and learning
    • Success comes from developing your potential
    • Challenges are opportunities to grow
  </right_column>

<slide number="6">
  <layout>CONCEPT</layout>
  <title>Mindset as a "Meaning System"</title>
  <content>
    Your mindset creates coherent patterns of:

    **Goals:** What you pursue
    • Fixed → Performance goals (look smart)
    • Growth → Learning goals (become smarter)

    **Beliefs:** What you think about effort
    • Fixed → Effort reveals lack of talent
    • Growth → Effort builds ability

    **Responses:** How you handle setbacks
    • Fixed → Helpless (it's proof I can't)
    • Growth → Resilient (what can I learn?)
  </content>

  <layout>VISUAL_COMPARISON</layout>
  <title>Fixed vs. Growth Mindset in Action</title>
  <content>
    **When facing a challenge:**

    Fixed Mindset → "I'm not good at this" → Avoids challenge → Ability remains static

    Growth Mindset → "I can't do this YET" → Embraces challenge → Ability develops

    **The power of "YET"**

  <layout>CASE_STUDY</layout>
  <title>Research Evidence: The National Study of Learning Mindsets</title>
  <content>
    **Largest mindset study ever conducted**
    • 12,000+ ninth graders across US schools
    • Short online intervention (&lt;1 hour)
    • Taught: "Intelligence can be developed through effort, strategy, and help-seeking"

    **Results:**
    • Improved grades for lower-achieving students
    • Increased enrollment in advanced math courses
    • Effects persisted over academic year

<slide number="9">
  <layout>REFLECTION</layout>
  <title>Self-Assessment: What's Your Mindset?</title>
  <content>
    Think about a recent challenge you faced (academic, professional, personal).

    Ask yourself:
    • Did I see it as a threat to my competence or an opportunity to learn?
    • When I struggled, did I think "I can't do this" or "I need a different strategy"?
    • Did I avoid the challenge or lean into it?
    • How did I feel about needing to put in effort?

    **Honest reflection:** We all have a mixture of both mindsets in different domains.

  <title>Part 2: The Science of Learning - Neuroplasticity</title>
</slide>

<slide number="11">
  <layout>CONCEPT</layout>
  <title>Your Brain Is Like a Muscle</title>
  <content>
    **Neuroplasticity:** The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life

    Key principles:
    • When you learn something new, your brain creates new neural pathways
    • Repeated practice strengthens these pathways (like strengthening muscles)
    • The more you use a skill, the more automatic it becomes
    • Your brain remains capable of growth and change across your lifespan

    **Implication:** Abilities are not fixed at birth—they develop through use.

  <title>How Learning Changes Your Brain</title>
  <content>
    **The Learning Process:**

    1. **Challenge** → Brain encounters difficulty
    2. **Effort** → Neurons fire and form connections
    3. **Practice** → Connections strengthen (myelination)
    4. **Mastery** → Skill becomes more automatic
    5. **New Challenge** → Process repeats at higher level

    "The brain is like a muscle—it gets stronger (and smarter) when you exercise it."
    — Dweck & Yeager (2019)

  <layout>EXAMPLE</layout>
  <title>Neuroplasticity in Action: Learning a New Language</title>
  <content>
    **Stage 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Struggle and confusion
    • Brain works hard to process new sounds and grammar
    • Feels effortful and frustrating
    • Neural pathways begin forming

    **Stage 2 (Months 2-6):** Pattern recognition
    • Brain starts recognizing common structures
    • Some automaticity develops
    • Pathways strengthen

    **Stage 3 (Year 1+):** Increasing fluency
    • Brain processes language more efficiently
    • Less conscious effort needed
    • Strong neural networks established

    **Key insight:** The struggle is necessary for growth.

  <title>From Neuroscience to Career Development</title>
  <content>
    **What neuroplasticity means for your career:**

    • You can learn skills you don't currently have
    • Career transitions are possible at any stage
    • Reskilling and upskilling are neurologically supported
    • Early struggle doesn't predict final capability
    • Continuous learning keeps your brain adaptable

    **Critical for AI era:** The skills you need in 5 years may not exist yet. Your ability to LEARN is more important than what you currently know.

<slide number="16">
  <layout>CONCEPT</layout>
  <title>How Mindsets Shape Responses to Failure</title>
  <content>
    **Fixed Mindset Interpretation:**
    "I failed → I'm not smart enough → This isn't for me → Give up"

    Failure is seen as:
    • Proof of limited ability
    • Threat to self-image
    • Permanent verdict on potential

    **Growth Mindset Interpretation:**
    "I failed → My current strategy didn't work → What can I learn? → Try differently"

    Failure is seen as:
    • Feedback on approach, not ability
    • Opportunity to learn
    • Temporary setback on growth path

  <title>Carol Dweck's Research Journey: Learning from "Failure"</title>
  <content>
    **The Controversy:** In 2016-2018, some researchers questioned whether growth mindset interventions really work.

    **Fixed Mindset Response Would Be:**
    "My theory is being attacked → Defend it → Dismiss critics"

    **Dweck's Growth Mindset Response:**
    "What can we learn from this controversy?" (Yeager & Dweck, 2020)
    • Acknowledged limitations in some implementations
    • Identified "false growth mindset" problem
    • Conducted larger, pre-registered replications
    • Improved interventions based on feedback

    **Lesson:** Even when studying growth mindset, Dweck practiced it by learning from criticism.

  <layout>FRAMEWORK</layout>
  <title>Reframing Failure: From Threat to Feedback</title>
  <content>
    **Instead of asking:**
    "Why am I so bad at this?"

    **Ask:**
    "What is this failure teaching me?"

    **Specific reframes:**
    • "I failed the exam" → "This study strategy didn't work; I need a different approach"
    • "I'm not a natural presenter" → "Presenting is a skill I can develop with practice"
    • "I can't code" → "I haven't learned to code yet"
    • "Networking feels impossible" → "I need to develop comfort with professional conversations"

    **The Vietnamese proverb:** "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" (Failure is the mother of success)

  <layout>ACTIVITY</layout>
  <title>Personal Reflection: Reframing a Past Failure</title>
  <content>
    **Think of a time you failed at something important.**

    Write brief notes:
    1. What happened? (Just the facts)
    2. What did you tell yourself about that failure at the time?
    3. Looking back now, what did you actually learn?
    4. How might a growth mindset have changed your response?
    5. What would you do differently if you faced a similar challenge today?

    **Share with a partner if comfortable.**

    The goal: Practice seeing failure as feedback, not verdict.

  <layout>DATA</layout>
  <title>The Changing Nature of Work</title>
  <content>
    **World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report (2025):**
    • 23% of jobs will change in next 5 years
    • Fastest growing roles require skills that didn't exist 10 years ago
    • Average skill half-life: ~5 years (your skills become outdated)

    **What this means:**
    • You will need to learn new skills multiple times in your career
    • Career changes are increasingly common
    • Adaptability is more valuable than any single skill

    **The most important skill:** Learning how to learn
  </content>
</slide>

<slide number="22">
  <layout>CONCEPT</layout>
  <title>Reskilling vs. Upskilling</title>
  <content>
    **Upskilling:** Developing new skills within your current field
    • Accountant learns data analytics
    • Marketer learns AI-powered tools
    • Manager develops strategic thinking

    **Reskilling:** Learning skills for a different role or career
    • Teacher transitions to corporate training
    • Engineer moves into product management
    • Retail worker learns digital marketing

    **Both require growth mindset:**
    Belief that you CAN learn what you don't currently know

  <title>Growth Mindset & Career Transitions</title>
  <content>
    **Example: Vietnamese professional career pivot**

    **Background:** Finance analyst, 5 years experience
    **Challenge:** Interested in sustainability consulting but has no environmental background

    **Fixed Mindset Thinking:**
    "I don't have an environmental degree → I can't transition → Stay in finance"

    **Growth Mindset Approach:**
    "I need to build environmental knowledge"
    → Takes online courses (Harvard's Climate &amp; Energy, Coursera Sustainability)
    → Joins Vietnam Green Building Council as volunteer
    → Applies finance skills to green finance projects
    → Transitions to ESG analyst role within 2 years

    **Key:** Saw lack of knowledge as developable, not disqualifying

  <title>Building Lifelong Learning Habits</title>
  <content>
    **Strategies for continuous adaptation:**

    **1. Adopt a learning goal orientation**
    • Focus on mastery, not just performance
    • Seek challenges that stretch you

    **2. Embrace the "beginner" phase**
    • Allow yourself to be bad at new things initially
    • View struggle as sign of growth, not inadequacy

    **3. Seek feedback actively**
    • Ask "What can I improve?" not "Did I do well?"
    • Use criticism as data for development

    **4. Reflect on learning process**
    • What strategies work for you?
    • How do you learn best? (Connect to Week 4: self-regulated learning)

  <title>Growth Mindset Across Course Concepts</title>
  <content>
    **Connecting to previous weeks:**

    • **Week 3 (Reflection):** Growth mindset helps you learn from experience rather than just repeat it
    • **Week 4 (Self-Managed Learning):** Belief in development fuels motivation to persist
    • **Week 5 (Self-Assessment):** Understanding your strengths doesn't mean they're fixed—strengths can grow
    • **Week 7 (Emotional Intelligence):** EI skills are developable, not innate
    • **Week 8 (Habits):** Growth mindset supports belief that you can build new habits

    **Looking ahead:**
    • **Week 11 (PDP):** Your development plan assumes you can grow—that's growth mindset in action

  <title>Warning: "False Growth Mindset"</title>
  <content>
    **What growth mindset is NOT:**

    ❌ Just praising effort ("You worked so hard!")
    • Effort alone isn't enough—you need effective strategies

    ❌ Positive thinking without action
    • "I believe I can improve" must lead to actual learning behaviors

    ❌ Ignoring real challenges
    • Growth mindset doesn't mean everything is easy or everyone will excel equally

    **What growth mindset IS:**

    ✓ Believing abilities develop through effort, strategy change, and help-seeking
    ✓ Linking effort to learning and outcomes
    ✓ Embracing challenges as opportunities to develop competence

  <title>Practical Strategies: Developing Your Growth Mindset</title>
  <content>
    **1. Change your self-talk**
    • Replace "I can't" with "I can't yet"
    • Replace "This is too hard" with "This will take time and effort"

    **2. Focus on process, not just outcomes**
    • Celebrate learning and improvement, not just final results
    • Ask "What did I learn?" alongside "How did I do?"

    **3. Seek challenges intentionally**
    • Volunteer for projects outside your comfort zone
    • Take courses in unfamiliar subjects

    **4. Learn from others' success**
    • Instead of feeling threatened, ask "What strategies did they use?"

    **5. Reflect on growth**
    • Keep a learning journal (connects to Week 3 reflection practices)
    • Document what you couldn't do 6 months ago that you can do now

  <title>Applying Growth Mindset to Your PDP</title>
  <content>
    **Your Personal Development Plan (Week 11) requires growth mindset:**

    **When setting goals, ask:**
    • What skills do I need to develop? (Not: What am I already good at?)
    • Where do I need to grow? (Not: Where can I avoid struggle?)
    • What challenges will push me? (Not: What's safe and comfortable?)

    **When facing obstacles:**
    • How can I adapt my strategy? (Not: Should I give up?)
    • Who can I ask for help? (Not: This proves I can't do it)
    • What's the next small step? (Not: It's impossible)

    **Remember:** Your PDP assumes you can develop into someone you're not yet. That's the essence of growth mindset.

  <layout>CASE_STUDY</layout>
  <title>Growth Mindset in Vietnamese Context</title>
  <content>
    **Cultural strengths supporting growth mindset:**

    • Vietnamese educational culture values hard work and persistence
    • Proverb: "Có công mài sắt có ngày nên kim" (Persistent effort can turn iron into needle)
    • Strong emphasis on continuous improvement

    **Potential cultural tensions:**

    • "Saving face" culture may make public failure difficult
    • High-stakes exams may emphasize performance over learning
    • Pressure to succeed quickly vs. allowing time for development

    **Balancing both:**
    • Honor effort and persistence (cultural strength)
    • Create safe spaces for learning from mistakes
    • Reframe failure as private feedback, not public shame

  <layout>SUMMARY</layout>
  <title>Key Takeaways</title>
  <content>
    **1. Mindsets shape your potential**
    Fixed mindset limits growth; growth mindset enables it

    **2. Your brain is plastic**
    Neuroplasticity means abilities can develop across your lifespan

    **3. Failure is feedback, not verdict**
    Setbacks teach you what to adjust, not what you can't achieve

    **4. Adaptability is essential**
    In the AI era, your capacity to learn matters more than current knowledge

    **5. Growth mindset is a practice**
    It's not a one-time belief—it's an ongoing choice to embrace challenges and persist through difficulty
