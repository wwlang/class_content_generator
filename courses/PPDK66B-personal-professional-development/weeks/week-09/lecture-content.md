# Growth Mindset & Adaptability

**Developing the Capacity for Lifelong Learning**

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 9, where we explore one of the most powerful concepts in personal development: growth mindset. Today we'll examine Carol Dweck's groundbreaking research on how our beliefs about intelligence and ability shape our entire approach to learning, challenges, and career development. This is particularly relevant as you prepare your Personal Development Plans - your mindset will determine whether you view your PDP as a fixed destination or an evolving journey. We'll also connect this to neuroplasticity, reskilling for career resilience, and learning from failure - all essential capabilities for the AI era we discussed in Week 1.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="2" title="Opening Activity: Mindset Self-Assessment">

## Mindset Self-Assessment

Rate your agreement (1-5 scale) with these statements:

1. "You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you really can't do much to change it"
2. "You can learn new things, but you can't really change your basic intelligence"
3. "Your talent for business is something you can't change very much"
4. "No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit"

**Scoring:**
- Statements 1-3: Reverse score (5=1, 4=2, 3=3, 2=4, 1=5)
- Statement 4: Score as-is
- Higher total = More growth mindset oriented

<speaker-notes>
Before we dive into the theory, let's assess where you currently stand. These items are adapted from the National Study of Learning Mindsets, the largest growth mindset study ever conducted with 12,000+ students. Take 60 seconds to rate each statement honestly - there are no right or wrong answers. This is about understanding your current beliefs. After today's lecture, you'll have an opportunity to reflect on whether you want to shift any of these beliefs. Notice that these statements are about whether abilities are fixed or changeable. The research shows that even small shifts in these beliefs can have meaningful impacts on how we approach challenges and setbacks. We'll return to your scores at the end of class.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** between fixed and growth mindset frameworks (Dweck, 2019)
2. **Explain** the neuroscience behind learning (neuroplasticity)
3. **Analyze** how mindsets affect responses to challenges and failure
4. **Apply** growth mindset to reskilling and career adaptability
5. **Implement** strategies to cultivate growth mindset in yourself

**Connection to Your PDP:**
Your mindset shapes every aspect of your development plan - how you set goals, respond to obstacles, and view your own potential.

<speaker-notes>
Today's session has five clear objectives that build progressively. We'll start with Carol Dweck's core framework distinguishing fixed from growth mindsets, then ground this in neuroscience to show you that growth mindset isn't just positive thinking - it's based on how the brain actually works. We'll then examine the practical implications: how do mindsets affect the way we approach challenges, setbacks, and failures? This directly connects to your mentorship experiences and your upcoming PDP. Fourth, we'll apply this specifically to career adaptability - in Week 1, we discussed how AI is reshaping careers. Growth mindset is what enables reskilling and upskilling throughout your career. Finally, we'll give you concrete strategies to cultivate growth mindset, because Dweck's research shows that mindsets can be changed. This isn't about who you are - it's about what you believe, and beliefs can evolve.

## How This Week Prepares You

**Personal Development Plan (Due Week 11):**
- Today: Learn how mindset shapes goal-setting and obstacle response
- Tutorial: Practice reframing fixed mindset statements
- Application: Frame PDP goals with growth mindset language

**Final Oral Exam:**
- Demonstrate growth mindset in your career vision
- Show how you'll respond to setbacks and challenges
- Articulate lifelong learning commitment

<speaker-notes>
This week directly prepares you for both your Personal Development Plan and Final Oral Exam. For your PDP, growth mindset affects how you set goals - are they stretch goals that require developing new capabilities, or safe goals that only leverage existing strengths? It affects how you plan for obstacles - do you anticipate setbacks as failures or as normal parts of development? It affects your entire timeline - do you view your 1-3-5 year roadmap as fixed predictions or evolving possibilities? For your oral exam, examiners will look for growth mindset in how you articulate your career vision and how you'll respond when plans don't work out. They want to see that you understand development is a journey, not a destination.

### CORE SECTION - SEGMENT 1: UNDERSTANDING MINDSETS

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Part 1: Fixed vs. Growth Mindset Framework">

# Part 1

## Fixed vs. Growth Mindset Framework

<speaker-notes>
Let's begin by understanding what mindsets actually are and why they matter so much for your personal and professional development.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" title="What Are Mindsets?">

## What Are Mindsets?

**Definition (Dweck & Yeager, 2019):**

**Mindset** = A "meaning system" - a set of beliefs that creates coherent patterns of:
- Goals we pursue
- Beliefs about effort
- Attributions we make
- Behaviors in response to challenges

**Two Core Mindsets:**

**Fixed Mindset:** Intelligence and abilities are static traits
- "You either have it or you don't"
- Talent is innate and unchangeable

**Growth Mindset:** Intelligence and abilities can be developed
- "You can cultivate your abilities through effort and strategies"
- Potential is nurtured over time

<speaker-notes>
Dweck and Yeager (2019) describe mindsets not just as isolated beliefs, but as complete "meaning systems" that shape how we interpret everything that happens to us. If you have a fixed mindset about intelligence, this belief cascades into specific patterns: you pursue performance goals to prove you're smart, you see effort as evidence of low ability, you attribute failure to lack of talent, and you avoid challenges that might expose your limitations. In contrast, a growth mindset creates a completely different cascade: you pursue learning goals to develop competence, you see effort as the path to mastery, you attribute failure to insufficient strategy or effort, and you embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. The key insight from their research is that these are belief systems, not personality traits. You aren't born with a fixed or growth mindset - you develop these beliefs based on experiences and messages you receive. And crucially, because they're beliefs, they can be changed.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="The Mindset Cascade">

## The Mindset Cascade: How Beliefs Shape Behavior

**Fixed Mindset Pattern:**
1. Belief: "Intelligence is fixed"
2. Goal: Prove I'm smart → Performance goals
3. Effort: Means I lack ability → Avoid effort
4. Failure: Proves I'm not smart → Helpless response
5. Behavior: Avoid challenges, give up easily

**Growth Mindset Pattern:**
1. Belief: "Intelligence can be developed"
2. Goal: Learn and improve → Learning goals
3. Effort: Path to mastery → Embrace effort
4. Failure: Information for improvement → Resilient response
5. Behavior: Seek challenges, persist through difficulty

**Result:** Same objective challenge, completely different response

<speaker-notes>
This slide shows the "meaning system" in action. Let's take a concrete example from your university experience. You receive a 55% on a business case analysis - a disappointing grade. If you're in a fixed mindset, you interpret this as evidence that you're not good at business analysis. Your goal was to prove you were smart, and you failed to prove it. The effort you put in becomes embarrassing - "I studied so hard and still got a bad grade; I must not have the talent for this." You feel helpless and consider avoiding advanced business courses. Now same situation, growth mindset: you see the 55% as feedback that your current strategies aren't working. Your goal is to learn business analysis, not to prove you already know it. The effort you put in is valuable, but perhaps misdirected - you need better strategies. You feel determined to figure out what you're missing. You actively seek challenges to improve. Same grade, same situation, but completely different emotional and behavioral response. This is the power and importance of mindset.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="9" title="Dweck's Research Journey">

## Dweck's Research Journey: From Lab to World

**Carol Dweck's 40+ Year Research Arc:**

**Era 1 (1970s-2000s): Basic Research**
- How do children respond to failure?
- What explains resilience vs. helplessness?
- Discovery: Beliefs about intelligence predict responses

**Era 2 (2000s-2020s): Applied Interventions**
- Can mindsets be taught?
- National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM): 12,000+ students
- Short (<1 hour) online intervention improved grades and course-taking

**Key Insight (Dweck, 2019):**

> "I realized I had a choice to make: use what I learn for the benefit of individuals and society, or just keep it in academic journals."

<speaker-notes>
What makes Dweck's research so compelling is her personal journey from basic researcher to applied scientist. In her 2019 reflection "The Choice to Make a Difference," she describes how her early lab studies with children revealed that some kids thrived on challenges while others crumbled. She was fascinated by the question: why? Her research revealed that children who believed intelligence was fixed showed helpless patterns, while children who believed intelligence could be developed showed resilient patterns. But she didn't stop at publishing these findings in academic journals. She made a deliberate choice to translate this research into interventions that could actually help people. This led to Era 2 - large-scale field experiments including the National Study of Learning Mindsets, which reached over 12,000 ninth-graders across the United States. The results showed that even a short online intervention teaching growth mindset improved grades for struggling students and increased enrollment in advanced courses. This research-to-practice journey should resonate with you as business students - it's a model of using evidence to create real-world impact.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="10" title="False Growth Mindset: What It's NOT">

## False Growth Mindset: What It's NOT

**Common Misconceptions (Dweck, 2019):**

❌ "Just praise effort" → Leads to empty effort without strategy

❌ "Just be positive" → Ignores importance of effective strategies

❌ "Everyone can achieve anything" → Unrealistic and dismissive of real constraints

❌ "Mindset is all that matters" → Ignores systemic barriers and resources

**True Growth Mindset:**

✓ Effort + Effective strategies + Learning from feedback

✓ Positive but realistic about obstacles

✓ Focus on developing potential within realistic constraints

✓ Acknowledge that mindset works alongside opportunity and support

<speaker-notes>
Before we go further, we need to address what Dweck calls "false growth mindset" - misunderstandings that have actually undermined the concept. The biggest misconception is that growth mindset means simply praising effort: "Good job trying hard!" But Dweck is clear that effort alone is not enough. If you're using ineffective strategies, more effort just means more ineffective practice. Growth mindset means effort plus strategy plus learning from feedback. Second misconception: growth mindset is just positive thinking. No - it's realistic optimism. You acknowledge obstacles while believing you can develop strategies to overcome them. Third misconception: "Anyone can achieve anything with the right mindset." This is both false and potentially harmful. Growth mindset doesn't erase real constraints - your height limits your basketball career, systemic barriers affect opportunities, resources matter. What growth mindset says is that within realistic constraints, you can develop your capacities further than you currently imagine. Finally, mindset doesn't operate in a vacuum. It works alongside opportunity, support, and resources. Understanding these nuances prevents you from falling into "false growth mindset" territory.

### CORE SECTION - SEGMENT 2: THE NEUROSCIENCE OF LEARNING

<slide number="11" layout="section-break" title="Part 2: Neuroplasticity">

# Part 2

## Neuroplasticity - The Science Behind Growth Mindset

<speaker-notes>
Now let's ground growth mindset in neuroscience. This isn't just motivational psychology - it's based on how the brain actually works.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Neuroplasticity: Your Brain is Not Fixed">

## Neuroplasticity: Your Brain is Not Fixed

**Neuroplasticity Definition:**
The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life

**Key Principles:**
1. **Use it or lose it:** Neural pathways that aren't used weaken
2. **Use it and improve it:** Repeated practice strengthens connections
3. **Specificity matters:** Practice what you want to improve
4. **Intensity matters:** Focused, effortful practice drives change

**The Brain-as-Muscle Metaphor:**

> "The brain is like a muscle - it gets stronger (and smarter) when you exercise it"
>
> *Dweck & Yeager (2019)*

<speaker-notes>
Neuroplasticity is the scientific foundation for growth mindset. For most of the 20th century, scientists believed the adult brain was essentially fixed - you were born with certain neural wiring and that was that. But research over the past 30 years has completely overturned this view. We now know the brain is remarkably plastic throughout life. When you practice a skill, you're not just "getting better" in some abstract sense - you're physically changing your brain. Neural connections strengthen with repeated use and weaken without it. This has four key implications. First, "use it or lose it" - skills you don't practice atrophy neurologically. Second, "use it and improve it" - deliberate practice actually builds neural architecture. Third, specificity matters - you have to practice the specific skill you want to develop; general "brain training" doesn't transfer. Fourth, intensity matters - focused, effortful, challenging practice drives neuroplastic change more than easy, automatic practice. This is why Dweck uses the brain-as-muscle metaphor in her interventions. It's not just a metaphor - it's neurobiologically accurate. Your brain literally gets "stronger" at whatever you practice intensively.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="How Learning Changes Your Brain">

## How Learning Changes Your Brain

**When you learn something new:**

1. **Neurons fire together** in response to new information
2. **Synaptic connections form** between neurons
3. **Repeated practice strengthens** these connections (long-term potentiation)
4. **Myelin sheaths thicken** around frequently used pathways (speeds signal transmission)
5. **Neural networks optimize** - more efficient processing over time

**Result:**
What was once difficult and effortful becomes easier and more automatic

**Career Implication:**
Skills that feel impossible today can become strengths tomorrow through deliberate practice

<speaker-notes>
Let me walk you through what physically happens in your brain when you learn a new skill - let's say data analysis in Excel. The first time you encounter a pivot table, multiple neurons fire as your brain processes this new information. If you practice creating pivot tables repeatedly, the synaptic connections between these neurons strengthen through a process called long-term potentiation - the more often neurons fire together, the stronger their connection becomes. With continued practice, myelin sheaths (fatty insulation) thicken around these neural pathways, which speeds up signal transmission. Over time, the neural networks involved in pivot table creation become more efficient and optimized. What once required intense concentration and 30 minutes to complete eventually becomes something you can do semi-automatically in 5 minutes. This is not just "getting better" - it's physical neural restructuring. The career implication is profound: skills that feel completely foreign and impossible today can, through deliberate practice, become core strengths. This applies to technical skills like Python programming, soft skills like public speaking, and metacognitive skills like strategic thinking. Your current abilities are not your destiny - they're your starting point.

<slide number="14" title="Growth Mindset Intervention: Core Content">

## Growth Mindset Intervention: Core Content

**What the Research-Based Intervention Teaches (Yeager & Dweck, 2020):**

**Message 1:** Abilities can be developed through action
- Not fixed traits you're born with

**Message 2:** The brain is like a muscle
- Neuroplasticity is real and happens throughout life

**Message 3:** Specific actions that develop abilities
- **Effort** (trying hard)
- **Strategy change** (trying different approaches)
- **Help-seeking** (learning from others)

**Delivery:** Autonomy-supportive, not didactic
- Students discover concepts through reading and reflection
- Not lecturing people to "just have a growth mindset"

<speaker-notes>
The actual growth mindset interventions that have been tested in research are quite specific and carefully designed. They teach three core messages. First, that abilities can be developed through action - they're not fixed traits you inherit. Second, the brain-as-muscle metaphor grounded in neuroplasticity science. Third, and this is crucial, specific actions that develop abilities: effort, strategy change, and help-seeking. Notice that it's not just "try harder" - it's try harder AND try different strategies AND ask for help when needed. What's equally important is HOW this is delivered. The interventions are autonomy-supportive, not didactic. Students read brief materials and engage in reflective writing. They're not lectured at or told "you must have a growth mindset." This matters because feeling controlled or lectured undermines autonomy, which ironically makes people defensive and less likely to adopt growth mindset. As you develop your own growth mindset and potentially help others develop theirs, remember: it's about creating opportunities for discovery and reflection, not preaching or praising.

### CORE SECTION - SEGMENT 3: CHALLENGES, FAILURE, AND RESILIENCE

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Part 3: Embracing Challenges & Learning from Failure">

# Part 3

## Embracing Challenges & Learning from Failure

<speaker-notes>
Now let's explore how mindsets shape our responses to challenges and failures - experiences you'll definitely encounter as you pursue your development plans.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="How Mindsets Affect Challenge-Seeking">

## How Mindsets Affect Challenge-Seeking

**Fixed Mindset Approach to Challenges:**
- Avoid challenges that might reveal limitations
- Prefer tasks you already know you can do well
- Challenge = Risk of looking incompetent
- "If I'm smart, it should be easy"

**Growth Mindset Approach to Challenges:**
- Seek challenges that will stretch current abilities
- Embrace tasks slightly beyond current comfort zone
- Challenge = Opportunity to develop new capabilities
- "If it's easy, I'm not learning anything"

**Dweck's Classic Study:**
Children could choose next puzzle: easier than last one or harder
- Fixed mindset children: 2/3 chose easier
- Growth mindset children: 90%+ chose harder

<speaker-notes>
One of Dweck's most revealing studies offered children a choice after completing a puzzle: try an easier puzzle or a harder one. Two-thirds of children with fixed mindsets chose the easier puzzle - they wanted to ensure success to prove they were smart. In contrast, over 90% of growth mindset children chose the harder puzzle. Many looked confused by the question - why would you choose something easier when you could learn more from something harder? This reveals a fundamental difference in how mindsets frame challenges. In fixed mindset, challenges are threats - they might expose limitations. Your goal is to look smart, so you avoid situations where you might look incompetent. You prefer tasks you've already mastered because they're safe performance showcases. There's also an implicit belief that "if I'm really talented, things should come easily." In growth mindset, challenges are opportunities - they're precisely what you need to develop new capabilities. Your goal is to learn, so you seek situations slightly beyond your current abilities. You understand that struggle is not a sign of inadequacy - it's a sign of growth. As you design your PDP goals, ask yourself: am I choosing "safe" goals that I know I can achieve easily, or "stretch" goals that will require developing new capabilities?
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="Learning from Failure: The Growth Mindset Advantage">

## Learning from Failure: The Growth Mindset Advantage

**When you experience failure or setback:**

**Fixed Mindset Response:**
- **Attribution:** "I failed because I lack ability"
- **Emotion:** Shame, helplessness
- **Behavior:** Give up, avoid similar tasks, make excuses
- **Learning:** Minimal - focused on self-protection

**Growth Mindset Response:**
- **Attribution:** "I failed because my strategy was ineffective"
- **Emotion:** Disappointment but determination
- **Behavior:** Analyze what went wrong, try different approach
- **Learning:** Maximal - failure becomes feedback

**Vietnamese Proverb:**
*"Thất bại là mẹ thành công"* (Failure is the mother of success)
- Growth mindset embodies this wisdom

<speaker-notes>
Failure is inevitable in any meaningful development journey. What matters is how you respond. In fixed mindset, failure is devastating because it's interpreted as evidence about your identity - "I failed because I'm not smart enough, talented enough, capable enough." This triggers shame and helplessness. Behaviorally, you either give up or avoid similar challenges in the future. You might also make excuses to protect your self-image - "I didn't really try" or "The task was unfair." Learning is minimal because you're focused on self-protection, not improvement. In growth mindset, failure is disappointing but not defining. It's interpreted as information about your strategy - "My current approach isn't working; I need to figure out what to do differently." This triggers determination rather than helplessness. Behaviorally, you analyze what went wrong, seek feedback, and try alternative strategies. Learning is maximal because you're genuinely curious about how to improve. This connects beautifully to the Vietnamese proverb "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" - failure is the mother of success. Growth mindset embodies this cultural wisdom. Failure isn't shameful - it's essential to the learning process. Every entrepreneur, scientist, and successful professional has a history of failures they learned from.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="18" title="Dweck's Own Example: Learning from Controversy">

## Dweck's Own Example: Learning from Controversy

**The Growth Mindset Controversies (2018-2020):**

**The Challenge:**
- Meta-analysis criticized mindset research (Sisk et al., 2018)
- Claims: "Effects are small or non-existent"
- Media amplified criticism: "Growth mindset debunked!"

**Dweck's Growth Mindset Response (2019, 2020):**
1. Acknowledged legitimate critiques
2. Conducted new large-scale pre-registered studies
3. Clarified what growth mindset is and isn't
4. Developed heterogeneity framework (when/where it works)

**Quote:**

> "Challenges and controversies became opportunities that improved the science"
>
> *Dweck (2019)*

<speaker-notes>
Dweck's own response to criticism of growth mindset research is a perfect example of growth mindset in action. In 2018, a meta-analysis by Sisk and colleagues criticized mindset research, claiming effect sizes were small or inconsistent. Media headlines declared "Growth mindset debunked!" Dweck could have responded defensively - after all, this was her life's work being attacked. Instead, she responded with classic growth mindset. She acknowledged the legitimate critiques, recognizing that early mindset research had limitations. She and her colleague David Yeager conducted new large-scale, pre-registered studies with rigorous methodology. They published papers clarifying what growth mindset is and isn't, addressing the "false growth mindset" problem. They developed a heterogeneity framework explaining when and where growth mindset interventions work most effectively - acknowledging that they don't work equally in all contexts. In her 2019 reflection, Dweck writes that "challenges and controversies became opportunities that improved the science." This is growth mindset embodied - failure and criticism become feedback that leads to improvement. As you face setbacks in your career, ask yourself: can I respond like Dweck did? Can I see criticism as information rather than identity threat?

### CORE SECTION - SEGMENT 4: CAREER ADAPTABILITY AND RESKILLING

<slide number="19" layout="section-break" title="Part 4: Growth Mindset for Career Resilience">

# Part 4

## Growth Mindset for Career Resilience

<speaker-notes>
Let's now connect growth mindset explicitly to your career development, particularly in the context of the AI-driven changes we discussed in Week 1.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Reskilling and Upskilling in the AI Era">

## Reskilling and Upskilling in the AI Era

**Why Growth Mindset Matters for Career Resilience:**

**Fixed Mindset Career Trap:**
- "I'm a marketing person, not a data person" → Limits opportunities
- Avoids learning new technologies: "I'm too old to learn Python"
- Resists industry changes: "This is how we've always done it"
- Career stagnates as field evolves

**Growth Mindset Career Advantage:**
- "I can develop data skills if marketing roles require them"
- Embraces learning new tools: "Python will be challenging but valuable"
- Adapts to industry evolution: "What new capabilities do I need?"
- Career evolves alongside field

**Week 1 Connection:**
AI is reshaping every industry - your ability to reskill determines your career resilience

<speaker-notes>
Let's connect this directly to your career context. In Week 1, we discussed how AI is reshaping work across all industries. The World Economic Forum estimates that 44% of workers' skills will be disrupted in the next five years. This means reskilling and upskilling aren't optional - they're essential for career resilience. Here's where mindset becomes crucial. If you have a fixed mindset about your professional identity - "I'm a marketing person, not a technical person" - you limit your opportunities as marketing becomes increasingly data-driven and AI-augmented. You avoid learning new technologies with thoughts like "I'm too old to learn Python" or "I'm just not a tech person." You resist industry changes with "This is how we've always done it." Your career stagnates as your field evolves around you. In contrast, with growth mindset, you see your professional identity as evolving. "I'm currently skilled in traditional marketing; I can develop data analytics capabilities as the field requires." You approach new technologies with realistic optimism: "Python will be challenging and require sustained effort, but it's developable." You proactively ask "What new capabilities do I need to develop?" Your career evolves alongside your field. This is the career resilience advantage of growth mindset.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="21" title="Self-Regulated Learning Across the Lifespan">

## Self-Regulated Learning Across the Lifespan

**Growth Mindset Enables Lifelong Learning:**

**The Learning Cycle (connecting to Week 4):**
1. **Set learning goals** (not just performance goals)
2. **Monitor progress** metacognitively
3. **Adjust strategies** when current approach isn't working
4. **Persist through challenges** with effort + strategy changes
5. **Reflect on learning** to extract insights

**Growth Mindset at Different Career Stages:**

**Early Career (20s-30s):** Building foundational skills
**Mid-Career (30s-40s):** Developing expertise, taking on leadership
**Late Career (50s-60s+):** Adapting to industry shifts, mentoring others

*At every stage: belief that you can continue developing new capabilities*

<speaker-notes>
Growth mindset is the psychological foundation for self-regulated learning, which we studied in Week 4. Remember Zimmerman's model of self-regulated learning? It requires setting learning goals, monitoring your progress, adjusting strategies when needed, persisting through difficulty, and reflecting on your learning. Every component of this cycle is easier with growth mindset. Why? Because growth mindset means you believe that your effort and strategy changes will lead to improvement - that's the motivation to persist. Fixed mindset undermines self-regulated learning because if you don't believe you can improve, why would you persist when things get difficult? Growth mindset is also essential across the entire lifespan. In your early career 20s and 30s, you're building foundational skills - growth mindset helps you embrace the steep learning curve. Mid-career 30s and 40s, you're developing expertise and taking on leadership - growth mindset prevents you from stagnating and helps you adapt as your responsibilities evolve. Late career 50s, 60s, and beyond, you're adapting to industry shifts and mentoring others - growth mindset prevents "I'm too old to learn new things" thinking. At every stage, the belief that you can continue developing new capabilities is what enables continued growth.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Context-Specific Growth Mindsets">

## Context-Specific Growth Mindsets

**Important Research Finding (Yeager & Dweck, 2020):**

You can have **different mindsets in different domains**

**Examples:**
- Growth mindset about business skills, fixed mindset about artistic ability
- Growth mindset about technical skills, fixed mindset about interpersonal skills
- Growth mindset about academic learning, fixed mindset about athletic ability

**Why This Matters:**
1. Don't assume your mindset is the same across all areas
2. Identify domains where you have fixed mindset beliefs
3. Those are precisely the areas where growth mindset could help most
4. Challenge domain-specific fixed beliefs: "I'm not a people person" → "I can develop interpersonal skills"

<speaker-notes>
A crucial finding from Yeager and Dweck's 2020 paper is that mindsets are often domain-specific. You might have a strong growth mindset about academic learning but a fixed mindset about athletic ability. Or growth mindset about technical skills but fixed mindset about creative or interpersonal skills. This is important for two reasons. First, don't assume that because you have growth mindset in one area, you have it everywhere. Self-assess domain by domain. Second, identifying where you have fixed mindset beliefs helps you target your development. For example, many business students tell me "I'm just not a people person" or "I'm not creative" - these are fixed mindset beliefs about specific domains. The question is: are these beliefs helping or limiting you? If your career requires strong interpersonal skills, the belief "I'm not a people person" becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. You avoid situations that would develop those skills, and your skills remain weak, confirming the belief. Breaking this cycle requires challenging the domain-specific fixed belief: "I haven't yet developed strong interpersonal skills, but I can cultivate them through practice, feedback, and strategy refinement." This opens up development pathways that were previously closed.

## Strategy 1: Reframe Your Inner Voice

**The Fixed Mindset Voice vs. Growth Mindset Response:**

**Situation: Struggling with new skill**

❌ Fixed: "I'm not good at this" or "This is too hard for me"
✓ Growth: "I'm not good at this **YET**" or "This is challenging right now"

**Situation: Receiving criticism**

❌ Fixed: "They think I'm incompetent" or "I should already know this"
✓ Growth: "This feedback will help me improve" or "What can I learn from this?"

**Situation: Watching someone excel**

❌ Fixed: "They're naturally talented; I can't compete"
✓ Growth: "What strategies are they using that I could learn?"

**The Power of "Yet":**
Adding "yet" transforms fixed statements into growth statements

<speaker-notes>
The first strategy for cultivating growth mindset is monitoring and reframing your inner voice. We all have an internal narrative commenting on our experiences. In fixed mindset, this voice makes definitive judgments: "I'm not good at this," "They think I'm incompetent," "I can't compete." These statements close down possibilities. Growth mindset reframes these same situations with different language. "I'm not good at this yet" - the word "yet" is incredibly powerful because it acknowledges current reality while implying future possibility. "This feedback will help me improve" - reframes criticism from identity threat to useful information. "What strategies are they using?" - reframes others' success from evidence of their superior talent to opportunities for you to learn. Start noticing your fixed mindset voice when it appears. It usually shows up during challenges, setbacks, or comparisons with others. Once you notice it, you can consciously reframe. This isn't about lying to yourself or false positivity - it's about accurate framing. The fixed mindset voice isn't truthful; it's limiting. The growth mindset voice is actually more accurate because abilities genuinely can be developed.

## Strategy 2: Focus on Process, Not Just Outcomes

**Shift Your Self-Talk and Goal-Setting:**

**Outcome Focus (Fixed Mindset Tendency):**
- "Did I succeed or fail?"
- "Do I look smart?"
- "What's my grade/score/rank?"

**Process Focus (Growth Mindset Approach):**
- "What did I learn?"
- "What strategies worked or didn't work?"
- "How can I improve my approach?"
- "What effort did I apply?"

**Application to Your PDP Goals:**

❌ Outcome-only: "Achieve 80% in all courses"

✓ Process-included: "Achieve 80% by using spaced repetition study, weekly mentor check-ins, and practice problem sets"

*Process goals give you control even when outcomes are uncertain*

<speaker-notes>
The second strategy is shifting from pure outcome focus to process focus. Fixed mindset tends to obsess over outcomes - did I succeed or fail? What's my grade? How do I rank? These are performance metrics that judge you. Growth mindset emphasizes process - what did I learn? What strategies worked? How can I improve? These are learning metrics that inform you. Here's why this matters: you don't always control outcomes. You can study hard and still get a difficult exam. You can prepare well and still lose a competition. If your only measure of success is the outcome, these situations feel like failures. But if you also measure process, you can succeed even when outcomes disappoint. "I didn't get the score I wanted, but I learned that spaced repetition works better for me than cramming, and I developed better test-taking strategies." This is genuine progress even if the grade doesn't reflect it yet. Apply this to your PDP goals. Instead of just "Achieve 80% in all courses," include the process: "Achieve 80% BY using spaced repetition study, weekly mentor check-ins, and practice problem sets." Now you have controllable process goals alongside the outcome goal. Even if you fall short of 80%, you know whether you consistently applied the processes, which builds self-efficacy and gives you actionable information for improvement.

<slide number="26" title="Strategy 3: Embrace 'Strategic Failures'">

## Strategy 3: Embrace "Strategic Failures"

**Redefine Failure as Feedback:**

**Before (Fixed Mindset Interpretation):**
Failure = Evidence I lack ability → Avoid challenges

**After (Growth Mindset Interpretation):**
Failure = Information about what doesn't work → Try different strategy

**Strategic Failure Framework:**
1. **Try** a challenging approach (even if success isn't guaranteed)
2. **Observe** what happens (data collection)
3. **Analyze** why approach didn't work (diagnosis)
4. **Adjust** strategy based on analysis (iteration)
5. **Try again** with refined approach (persistence)

*This is the scientific method applied to your development*

**Quote to Remember:**
*"Thất bại là mẹ thành công"* (Failure is the mother of success)

<speaker-notes>
The third strategy is completely redefining your relationship with failure. In fixed mindset, failure is verdict - evidence that you lack ability. This makes you avoid challenges where failure is possible. In growth mindset, failure is feedback - information about what doesn't work that helps you figure out what will work. I want to introduce you to the concept of "strategic failures" - deliberately taking on challenges where you might fail because the learning is valuable. Here's the framework: First, try a challenging approach even if success isn't guaranteed. Second, observe what happens with curiosity rather than judgment - you're collecting data. Third, analyze why the approach didn't work - was it poor strategy? Insufficient effort? Missing skills? Wrong context? Fourth, adjust your strategy based on this analysis. Fifth, try again with your refined approach. This is literally the scientific method applied to personal development. Scientists don't view failed experiments as evidence they're bad scientists - they view them as information that refines their hypotheses. You should view your setbacks the same way. This connects to the Vietnamese cultural proverb we mentioned earlier: "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" - failure is the mother of success. Embrace this wisdom. Strategic failures are not setbacks - they're necessary steps in the development process.

<slide number="27" title="Strategy 4: Seek and Use Feedback Actively">

## Strategy 4: Seek and Use Feedback Actively

**Growth Mindset Approach to Feedback:**

**1. Actively Seek Feedback**
- Don't wait for formal reviews
- Ask specific questions: "What's one thing I could improve?"
- Request feedback from mentors, professors, peers

**2. Receive Feedback Non-Defensively**
- Listen fully before responding
- Resist urge to explain or justify
- Thank the person for their input

**3. Extract Actionable Insights**
- "What specifically can I do differently?"
- "What resources or strategies would help?"

**4. Implement and Follow Up**
- Act on feedback to demonstrate growth mindset
- Report back: "I tried your suggestion; here's what happened"

**Mentorship Connection:** Use your mentor meetings to practice this

<speaker-notes>
The fourth strategy is actively seeking and using feedback, which is essential for growth. Many people avoid feedback because they fear it will confirm they're not good enough - that's fixed mindset. Growth mindset sees feedback as valuable information that accelerates learning. Here's a four-step process. First, actively seek feedback rather than waiting for formal reviews. Ask your mentors, professors, and peers specific questions like "What's one thing I could improve in my presentations?" Specific questions get more useful feedback than vague "How did I do?" Second, when you receive feedback, receive it non-defensively. This is hard, especially when feedback stings, but resist the urge to immediately explain, justify, or defend. Listen fully, then thank the person. You can process your emotions later, but in the moment, show that you value their input. Third, extract actionable insights by asking follow-up questions: "What specifically could I do differently? What strategies or resources would help?" Fourth, actually implement the feedback and then follow up with the person: "I tried your suggestion about structuring presentations differently; here's what happened." This demonstrates growth mindset in action and encourages people to continue giving you valuable feedback. Your mentorship program is the perfect opportunity to practice this. Come to each meeting actively seeking feedback, receive it non-defensively, extract actionable insights, and implement before the next meeting.

<slide number="28" title="Strategy 5: Celebrate Effort and Strategy, Not Just Talent">

## Strategy 5: Celebrate Effort and Strategy, Not Just Talent

**What to Praise in Yourself and Others:**

❌ **Trait Praise:** "I'm smart" / "You're talented"
- Reinforces fixed mindset
- Creates fear of challenges that might disprove trait

✓ **Process Praise:** "I used effective strategies" / "You tried multiple approaches"
- Reinforces growth mindset
- Builds confidence in controllable factors

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- What strategies did I use today?
- What effort did I apply?
- What did I learn from this challenge?
- How did I persist when things got difficult?

**Celebrate learning, not just performance**

<speaker-notes>
The fifth strategy involves changing how you praise yourself and others. Research shows that trait praise - "I'm smart," "You're so talented" - actually reinforces fixed mindset. It makes you attribute success to inherent qualities, which creates fear of challenges that might disprove those qualities. If you believe you succeeded because you're smart, what does failure mean? Process praise is more effective: "I used effective study strategies," "You tried multiple approaches before finding one that worked." This attributes success to controllable factors - strategy, effort, persistence - which builds confidence that you can succeed in future challenges through similar approaches. Apply this to your own self-reflection. Instead of judging yourself as "smart" or "not smart," ask: What strategies did I use? What effort did I apply? What did I learn? How did I persist? These questions focus on controllable processes. Celebrate learning, not just performance. When you master a challenging concept after struggling with it, that's worth celebrating even if your test score isn't perfect. When you try a new approach that doesn't work but teaches you something valuable, that's worth celebrating. This reframes your entire relationship with achievement from fixed judgments to growth processes.

<slide number="30" title="Applying Growth Mindset to Your Personal Development Plan">

## Applying Growth Mindset to Your PDP

**Your PDP Through a Growth Mindset Lens:**

**Goal-Setting:**
✓ Set "stretch goals" that require developing new capabilities
✓ Include process goals alongside outcome goals
✓ Frame goals as learning objectives, not just performance targets

**Obstacle Planning:**
✓ Anticipate setbacks as normal part of development
✓ Plan multiple strategies for each goal
✓ Build in accountability and feedback mechanisms

**Self-Assessment Integration:**
✓ View current abilities as starting point, not destiny
✓ Focus on developing areas of weakness, not just leveraging strengths

**Timeline:**
✓ Recognize that meaningful development takes time
✓ Measure progress, not perfection

<speaker-notes>
Let's explicitly connect growth mindset to your Personal Development Plan, which is due in Week 11. First, goal-setting: set stretch goals that will require you to develop new capabilities, not just goals you know you can easily achieve. Include process goals - the strategies and habits you'll use - alongside outcome goals. Frame goals as learning objectives, not just performance targets. Second, obstacle planning: with growth mindset, you anticipate setbacks as a normal part of development rather than signs of failure. Plan multiple strategies for each goal so when one doesn't work, you have alternatives. Build in accountability and feedback mechanisms so you get regular information about your progress. Third, self-assessment integration: view your current MBTI, strengths, and EI results as your starting point, not your destiny. Yes, leverage your strengths, but also deliberately work on developing areas of weakness. Growth mindset means you're not limited to "playing to your strengths" - you can develop new strengths. Fourth, timeline: recognize that meaningful development takes time. Measure progress, not perfection. If your 1-year goal is to "become confident at public speaking," what does 20% progress look like? 50%? 80%? Growth is incremental, not binary. Your PDP should reflect the understanding that you are continuously developing, not trying to reach a fixed endpoint.

<slide number="31" title="Key Takeaways: Research-Backed Insights">

## Key Takeaways: Research-Backed Insights

**What the Science Tells Us:**

1. **Mindsets are belief systems that shape motivation and behavior** (Dweck & Yeager, 2019)

2. **The brain is plastic throughout life - abilities can be developed** (neuroplasticity research)

3. **Growth mindset affects challenge-seeking and resilience** (Dweck's 40+ years of research)

4. **Effective growth mindset = effort + strategy + help-seeking** (not just praise for trying)

5. **Mindsets can be changed** (intervention research shows meaningful effects)

6. **Growth mindset is especially valuable in contexts of challenge and uncertainty** (Yeager & Dweck, 2020)

**Your career in the AI era will require continuous reskilling - growth mindset is your foundation**

<speaker-notes>
Let's consolidate the key research-backed insights. First, mindsets aren't personality traits - they're belief systems about whether abilities are fixed or developable, and these beliefs shape your goals, attributions, and behaviors. Second, neuroplasticity research shows the brain is plastic throughout life, providing the biological basis for growth mindset. Third, Dweck's 40+ years of research demonstrates that growth mindset affects real outcomes - challenge-seeking, resilience, achievement trajectories. Fourth, effective growth mindset isn't just praise for effort - it's effort combined with effective strategies and willingness to seek help when needed. Fifth, mindsets can be changed. The interventions Dweck and Yeager developed show that even short educational experiences can shift mindsets with meaningful effects on student outcomes. Sixth, growth mindset is especially valuable in contexts of challenge and uncertainty - which describes your career context perfectly. In the AI era we discussed in Week 1, continuous learning and reskilling aren't optional. Growth mindset is your psychological foundation for thriving in this environment. Without it, the pace of change feels threatening. With it, change becomes opportunity.

<slide number="32" title="Reflection: Revisiting Your Mindset Assessment">

## Reflection: Revisiting Your Mindset Assessment

**Return to Your Opening Self-Assessment:**

Look back at your responses to the four mindset items:

1. Are you satisfied with your current mindset beliefs?
2. In which domains (academic, professional, interpersonal, creative) do you hold fixed beliefs?
3. How might fixed mindset beliefs be limiting your development?
4. What's one specific fixed belief you want to challenge this week?

**Action Commitment:**
Choose ONE area where you'll deliberately apply growth mindset strategies this week and share with a partner

**Mentorship Connection:**
Discuss growth vs. fixed mindset with your mentor - where do they see each in their career?

<speaker-notes>
Now let's return to the self-assessment you completed at the beginning of class. Look at your responses to the four mindset statements. After everything we've discussed today, are you satisfied with your current mindset beliefs? Remember, this isn't about judging yourself - fixed mindset isn't a character flaw, it's a belief system that can be changed. Second question: in which domains do you hold fixed beliefs? Academic? Professional? Interpersonal? Creative? Athletic? Be specific. Third: how might these fixed beliefs be limiting your development? What opportunities are you avoiding? What challenges are you not taking on? What goals are you not setting because you believe "I'm just not that kind of person"? Fourth: what's one specific fixed belief you want to challenge this week? Make this concrete. In a moment, I'm going to ask you to share with a partner: choose one area where you'll deliberately apply growth mindset strategies this week. Maybe it's approaching a challenging assignment with "I haven't mastered this yet" framing. Maybe it's seeking feedback on something you usually avoid feedback about. Make a specific commitment. Finally, I encourage you to discuss growth vs. fixed mindset with your mentor in your next meeting. Ask them where they've seen each mindset in their own career and what they've learned about developing a growth mindset.

# Remember

## You Are Not Yet Who You Will Become

*Your current abilities are your starting point, not your destination*

<speaker-notes>
I want to leave you with one final thought that captures the essence of growth mindset: you are not yet who you will become. Your current abilities, knowledge, and skills are your starting point, not your destination. The MBTI results, strengths assessments, and EI scores you've explored in this course describe who you are today - they don't prescribe who you must remain. Every skill you now take for granted was once impossibly difficult. You couldn't always read, write, analyze business cases, or give presentations. You developed these capabilities through sustained practice. The same applies to whatever skills you need for your career vision - data analytics, strategic thinking, leadership, creativity, resilience. They feel foreign now, but they're developable. Growth mindset isn't naive optimism - it's evidence-based realism about human potential and brain plasticity. It's the belief that with effective strategies, sustained effort, feedback-seeking, and persistence through challenges, you can develop capabilities that currently feel out of reach. This belief doesn't guarantee easy success, but it enables the persistence necessary for difficult success. As you complete your PDPs and present them in your oral exams, I want to see stretch goals grounded in growth mindset - ambitious visions of who you're becoming, not just safe predictions of who you already are. Thank you, and I look forward to our tutorial.
