## Activity 1: Mindset Self-Diagnosis—Finding Your Fixed Mindset Triggers (20 minutes)

### Purpose
Honest self-assessment of where fixed mindset shows up in your thinking; develop awareness of mindset patterns that may limit career development.

### Instructions

**Individual Reflection (12 minutes):**

Complete the following self-assessment:

#### Part A: Mindset Patterns Inventory

**Rate how often you experience each thought/behavior (1=Rarely, 5=Very Often):**

| Fixed Mindset Pattern | Rating (1-5) | Specific Example |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------|
| "I'm just not good at [skill/subject]" | | |
| Avoiding challenges that might make me look incompetent | | |
| Giving up quickly when something is difficult | | |
| Feeling threatened when others succeed at something I struggle with | | |
| Taking criticism personally rather than as helpful feedback | | |
| Believing talent matters more than effort | | |
| Hiding mistakes rather than learning from them | | |
| Comparing myself to others and feeling inadequate | | |
| Thinking "If I have to work hard at this, I must lack natural ability" | | |
| Staying in my comfort zone to preserve my self-image | | |

**Add up your total score: _____ / 50**

**Interpretation:**
- **10-20:** Strong growth mindset orientation (but watch for specific triggers)
- **21-35:** Mixed mindset (some areas growth-oriented, others fixed)
- **36-50:** Predominantly fixed mindset (significant development opportunity)

**Important:** Everyone has fixed mindset tendencies in some areas. The goal isn't perfection—it's awareness and strategic intervention.

#### Part B: Domain-Specific Mindset Mapping

**In the table below, list specific skills/subjects and identify your mindset for each:**

| Skill/Subject Area | Current Mindset (Fixed/Growth/Mixed) | Evidence (What do you tell yourself?) | Impact on Development |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Example: Public speaking | Fixed | "I'm naturally introverted and bad at presentations" | I avoid opportunities to practice; skills don't improve |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Focus areas to consider:**
- Technical skills (data analysis, coding, AI tools)
- Interpersonal skills (networking, negotiation, leadership)
- Creative skills (writing, design, strategic thinking)
- Language skills (English proficiency, business communication)
- Academic subjects (finance, economics, marketing analytics)

#### Part C: Identifying Your Biggest Fixed Mindset Trigger

**Write 2-3 paragraphs answering:**

1. **Which domain from Part B most limits your career potential?**
   - Why is this domain important for your career goals?
   - How has fixed mindset held you back?

2. **What's the origin of this fixed mindset belief?**
   - Early experience? ("I failed at math in 7th grade")
   - Comparison to others? ("My roommate is naturally better at this")
   - External messaging? ("People told me I'm not analytical")

3. **What evidence contradicts this fixed mindset?**
   - Times you've successfully learned difficult things
   - Examples of people who developed this skill despite initial struggle
   - Knowledge that neuroplasticity makes skill development possible

### Small Group Discussion (8 minutes)

**Form groups of 3-4 students.**

**Discussion prompts:**

1. **Share your biggest fixed mindset trigger** (the domain you identified in Part C). You don't have to share your full reflection—just the skill/subject and why it matters for your career. (3 minutes)

2. **Peer coaching:** For each person who shares, the group offers:
   - Evidence that contradicts their fixed mindset (e.g., "But you're good at X, which also requires analytical thinking")
   - Encouragement that the skill is developable
   - Suggestions for first steps toward growth mindset in that domain (3 minutes)

3. **Pattern recognition:** What common fixed mindset triggers did your group identify? (2 minutes)

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor facilitates whole-class debrief (2 minutes):**

"What I want you to take from this activity:

**You're not broken if you have fixed mindset triggers. Everyone does.**

The difference between people who develop and people who stagnate isn't absence of fixed mindset—it's:
1. **Awareness:** Recognizing when fixed mindset is operating
2. **Intervention:** Actively reframing and choosing growth-oriented responses
3. **Practice:** Repeatedly choosing challenge over comfort

**Save this self-assessment. You'll use it to inform your PDP and Mentor Meeting #4.**"

## Activity 2: Failure Autopsy—Learning from Past Setbacks (25 minutes)

### Purpose
Apply the Failure Analysis Framework (from lecture) to a real setback; transform failure from identity threat to strategic feedback.

### Setup

**Instructor introduces:**

"Failure is one of the most powerful learning experiences—but only if you extract the lessons. Most people either:
- Avoid thinking about failures (too painful)
- Ruminate without learning (just feel bad repeatedly)

Today, you'll do a structured **failure autopsy**—examining a setback to extract actionable insights."

### Instructions

**Individual Reflection and Writing (15 minutes):**

#### Step 1: Select a Setback

**Choose a specific failure or setback from the past year:**

Examples:
- Failed exam or poor grade in important class
- Rejected job/internship application
- Conflict with team member on group project
- Missed opportunity due to fear or procrastination
- Business idea that didn't work
- Personal goal you didn't achieve

**Describe what happened (2-3 sentences):**

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

#### Step 2: Identify Your Initial Response

**How did you respond emotionally and behaviorally right after this failure?**

Check all that apply:
- [ ] Blamed myself harshly ("I'm such a failure")
- [ ] Avoided thinking about it
- [ ] Made excuses or blamed external factors entirely
- [ ] Gave up on related goals
- [ ] Felt shame or embarrassment
- [ ] Compared myself to others who succeeded
- [ ] Questioned my abilities or career fit
- [ ] Other: ___________________________

**What mindset (fixed or growth) dominated your initial response?**

___________________________________________________________

#### Step 3: Apply the Failure Analysis Framework

**Answer each question thoroughly:**

**A. Describe objectively: What exactly happened?**
- Stick to facts, not interpretations
- Example: "I scored 65% on the finance midterm" NOT "I'm terrible at finance"

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

**B. Analyze strategically: Why did this happen?**

**Controllable factors (things you could have influenced):**
- Study approach? Time management? Preparation? Strategy? Skill gaps? Effort?

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

**Uncontrollable factors (things outside your influence):**
- Luck? Circumstances? Other people's decisions? Systemic issues?

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

**C. Extract lessons: What can you learn from this?**
- About your approach/strategy?
- About your assumptions?
- About your preparation?
- About the domain itself?

**Key insight 1:** ___________________________________________

**Key insight 2:** ___________________________________________

**Key insight 3:** ___________________________________________

**D. Adjust strategy: What will you do differently next time?**

**Specific, actionable changes:**

1. ___________________________________________________________

2. ___________________________________________________________

3. ___________________________________________________________

**E. Persist with new approach: What's your next action?**

**Commitment:**
I will ______________________________________________________

by [date]: ____________________

**Accountability:** I will share this goal with: ___________________

#### Step 4: Growth Mindset Reframe

**Original fixed mindset interpretation of this failure:**

"This failure means ___________________________________________"

(Example: "This failure means I'm not cut out for finance careers")

**Growth mindset reframe:**

"This failure taught me _______________________________________,

and my next step is ___________________________________________"

(Example: "This failure taught me that I need to change my study strategy from passive reading to active practice problems, and my next step is to form a study group and attend professor office hours weekly")

### Pair-Share Discussion (10 minutes)

**Find a partner (not from your Activity 1 group).**

**Instructions:**

1. **Share your failure and your growth mindset reframe** (not all the details—just the situation and your reframe). (4 minutes—2 min each)

2. **Peer feedback:**
   - Is the reframe authentically growth-oriented, or does it still contain fixed mindset thinking?
   - Are the strategy adjustments specific and actionable enough?
   - What additional insights might this failure offer? (4 minutes)

3. **Mutual accountability:** Exchange commitments from Step 3E. Agree to check in with each other in 1 week about progress. (2 minutes)

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor says:**

"The setback you just analyzed probably felt terrible when it happened. But through structured reflection, you've transformed it into:
- Strategic insights
- Specific improvements
- Actionable next steps

**This is the difference between failure that defeats you and failure that develops you.**

Every successful person you admire has failed—repeatedly. The difference is they treated failure as feedback, not identity.

**For your PDP:** Include examples of how you've learned from failure. Employers value resilience and growth orientation as much as success."

## Activity 3: Reskilling Plan Development—Preparing for Your Field's Future (20 minutes)

### Purpose
Create a preliminary reskilling plan aligned with your career field; apply growth mindset to emerging skill needs; integrate with PDP.

### Instructions

**Individual Work (15 minutes):**

#### Part A: Career Field Analysis

**Your target career field/industry:**

___________________________________________________________

**Based on your knowledge (and Week 1-2 content on future of work), identify:**

**1. Skills currently required in this field:**

| Skill Category | Specific Skills |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Technical/Hard Skills** | |
| **Transferable/Soft Skills** | |
| **Domain-Specific Knowledge** | |

**2. Skills likely to be needed in 3-5 years:**

(Consider: AI impact, automation, market changes, new technologies)

| Emerging Skill | Why It's Becoming Important |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

**3. Skills at risk of obsolescence:**

(What skills currently valued might be automated or less relevant?)

| Skill | Why At Risk |
|-------|-------------|
| | |
| | |

#### Part B: Personal Reskilling Gap Analysis

**Compare your current capabilities to future needs:**

| Skill Needed (3-5 years) | Current Level (1-5) | Target Level (1-5) | Gap Priority (H/M/L) | Fixed Mindset Risk? |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Example: AI-assisted data analysis | 2 | 4 | High | Yes - "I'm not technical" |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Note:** "Fixed Mindset Risk" = domains where you might tell yourself "I can't learn this"

#### Part C: Strategic Reskilling Plan

**For your top 3 priority skills, create action plans:**

**Skill 1:** _______________________________________________

**Growth mindset challenge:**
- What fixed mindset self-talk might I encounter? ___________________
- How will I reframe it? ___________________________________________

**Learning strategy:**
- Resources I'll use (courses, books, tutorials, mentors): ___________

1. **Track progress:** How? (journal, app, spreadsheet?) _______________

2. **Seek support:** Who will I ask for help? (mentor, peers, tutors, online communities?) _______________________________________________

3. **Celebrate milestones:** How will I acknowledge progress? __________

4. **Handle setbacks:** When I struggle or fail, I will use the Failure Analysis Framework (Activity 2)

### Small Group Sharing (5 minutes)

**Form groups of 3-4.**

**Each person shares:**

1. Your career field and top priority reskilling skill
2. The fixed mindset challenge you anticipate facing
3. Your growth mindset reframe

**Group provides:**
- Encouragement and validation that the skill is developable
- Suggestions for resources or learning strategies
- Shared accountability (exchange contact info if helpful)

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor says:**

"What you just created is a draft of the **reskilling component** of your Personal Development Plan.

**This isn't a 'nice to have'—it's essential for career survival.**

By 2030, nearly half of all workers will need significant reskilling. You're ahead of the curve because you're planning for it now.

**Growth mindset makes reskilling possible. Fixed mindset makes it terrifying.**

Approach emerging skills not as threats to your current competence, but as opportunities to expand your capabilities."

## Activity 4: SMART Goal Reframing—Growth Mindset in Action (15 minutes)

### Purpose
Transform vague or fixed-mindset goals into growth-oriented SMART goals; practice goal-setting language for PDP.

### Instructions

**Individual Work (10 minutes):**

**Below are common career goals written with fixed mindset language. Rewrite each using growth mindset principles:**

#### Example Transformation:

**❌ Fixed mindset goal:**
"Find a job that fits my natural strengths so I don't have to work on weaknesses"

**✅ Growth mindset SMART goal:**
"By June 2026, develop public speaking confidence (currently a weakness) by presenting in 5 professional settings, joining Toastmasters, and seeking mentor feedback after each presentation, so I can expand my career options beyond roles that avoid public speaking"

**Why this is growth-oriented:**
- Acknowledges current weakness but frames as developable
- Specific actions and timeline (SMART)
- Embraces challenge rather than avoiding it
- Focuses on expanding capabilities, not limiting to current strengths

---

**Now reframe these goals:**

**1. ❌ Fixed mindset goal:**
"Avoid technical roles because I'm not good with technology"

**✅ Growth mindset SMART goal:**

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

---

**2. ❌ Fixed mindset goal:**
"Only apply to jobs I'm 100% qualified for so I don't get rejected"

**✅ Growth mindset SMART goal:**

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

---

**3. ❌ Fixed mindset goal:**
"Stick to marketing roles because I'm creative, not analytical"

**✅ Growth mindset SMART goal:**

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

---

**4. ❌ Fixed mindset goal:**
"Hope to be promoted eventually if I work hard enough"

**✅ Growth mindset SMART goal:**

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

---

**5. Now write YOUR goals:**

**One of your actual 1-year goals for your PDP:**

**First draft (check for fixed mindset language):**

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

**Growth mindset SMART version:**

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

**What changed?** ___________________________________________

### Pair-Share Peer Review (5 minutes)

**Partner up.**

**Exchange your goal #5 (your actual PDP goal).**

**Peer review using these questions:**

1. **Is it truly SMART?** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
2. **Does it reflect growth mindset?** (Embraces challenge, focuses on development, strategic about learning)
3. **Does it avoid fixed mindset traps?** (No avoidance language, no "I can't" thinking)
4. **Is it ambitious enough?** (Challenges you without being unrealistic)
5. **Suggested improvements:**

**Revise your goal based on feedback.**

### Key Takeaway

**Instructor says:**

"Goal-setting is where mindset becomes visible.

**Fixed mindset goals:**
- Minimize risk and challenge
- Protect current self-image
- Limit you to what you can already do

**Growth mindset goals:**
- Embrace strategic challenge
- Focus on who you're becoming
- Expand your capabilities

**When you write your PDP next week, every goal should reflect growth mindset. Use the language and framing you practiced today.**"
