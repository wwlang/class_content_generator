## Tutorial Structure

### Quick Review (5 minutes)

**Activity: Mindset Moment**

Individually reflect on one question:
- "When was the last time you avoided a challenge because you feared you might not succeed?"

Think about:
- What was the challenge?
- What thoughts went through your mind?
- Looking back, was that fixed mindset or growth mindset thinking?

Share briefly with person next to you (1 minute each).

**Facilitator Recap:** Today we'll move from understanding growth mindset theory to actively applying it. You'll leave with a personalized plan for cultivating growth mindset in areas where you currently hold fixed beliefs.

### Main Activity (75 minutes)

#### PART 1: Domain-Specific Mindset Mapping (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Identify where you have fixed vs. growth mindsets across different life domains

**Individual Activity (10 minutes):**

Complete the Domain Mindset Assessment worksheet:

For each domain, rate your agreement (1-5 scale) with the FIXED mindset statement:

**Academic/Intellectual Domain:**
- "My intelligence is something I can't change very much" (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)

**Professional/Career Domain:**
- "I have certain career-related abilities, and I really can't do much to change them"

**Interpersonal/Social Domain:**
- "My ability to connect with others and build relationships is fixed"

**Creative Domain:**
- "Some people are creative, and others aren't - I can't really change how creative I am"

**Physical/Athletic Domain:**
- "My physical abilities and coordination are set - I'm either athletic or not"

**Emotional/Psychological Domain:**
- "My emotional patterns and mental health are pretty much set"

**Technical/Digital Domain:**
- "I'm either good with technology or I'm not - it's not something I can really develop"

**Leadership Domain:**
- "Leadership ability is something you're born with - you either have it or you don't"

**Scoring:**
- 1-2: Growth mindset in this domain
- 3: Mixed/neutral mindset
- 4-5: Fixed mindset in this domain

**Reflection Questions:**
1. Which 2-3 domains show strongest FIXED mindset (highest scores)?
2. Are these domains important for your career goals?
3. How might fixed beliefs in these domains be limiting you?

**Pair Share (5 minutes):**
- Share your 2-3 highest fixed mindset domains
- Discuss: "How might these fixed beliefs have influenced your choices or behavior?"

#### PART 2: Reframing Fixed Mindset Statements (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice transforming fixed mindset language into growth mindset language

**Group Activity (12 minutes):**

Divide into groups of 4-5 students. Each group receives 8 common fixed mindset statements to reframe.

**Fixed Mindset Statements to Reframe:**

1. "I'm just not a math person"
2. "I'm too shy to be good at networking"
3. "I don't have leadership potential"
4. "I'm not creative - I'm more analytical"
5. "I'm terrible at public speaking and always will be"
6. "I can't learn technical skills like coding at this point"
7. "I don't have the personality for sales or marketing"
8. "I'm not good at managing my time"

**Task:** For each statement:
1. Identify the fixed mindset assumption
2. Reframe it as growth mindset statement
3. Add a specific action that reflects growth mindset

**Example:**
- Fixed: "I'm just not a math person"
- Assumption: Mathematical ability is innate and fixed
- Reframe: "I haven't yet developed strong mathematical skills, but I can improve through practice and better strategies"
- Action: "I will work through Khan Academy modules for 30 minutes daily and attend tutoring weekly"

**Class Share (8 minutes):**
- Each group shares 2-3 of their best reframings
- Facilitator highlights effective reframings that include:
  - The word "yet" or similar future-oriented language
  - Specific, actionable strategies
  - Process focus (effort + strategy) not just positive thinking

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Growth mindset reframing isn't just "being positive" - it's realistic acknowledgment that abilities develop
- Always pair reframed belief with specific action
- Focus on controllable factors: effort, strategy, feedback-seeking

#### PART 3: Applying Growth Mindset to Current Challenges (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Apply growth mindset strategies to real challenges students are facing

**Individual Reflection (10 minutes):**

Choose ONE current challenge you're facing (can be related to PDP, mentorship, coursework, career preparation, or personal development).

Answer these questions in writing:

**1. Describe the Challenge:**
What specifically is difficult or challenging right now?

**2. Identify Fixed Mindset Thoughts:**
What fixed mindset thoughts have you had about this challenge?
(Examples: "I'm not good enough," "I can't do this," "Others are naturally better at this")

**3. Reframe with Growth Mindset:**
How would you reframe this challenge through a growth mindset lens?
(Include: current abilities, potential for development, specific strategies)

**4. Effort + Strategy + Help-Seeking:**
- **Effort:** What consistent effort will you apply?
- **Strategy:** What specific strategies will you try?
- **Help-Seeking:** Who can you learn from or ask for help?

**5. Strategic Failure Plan:**
If your first approach doesn't work, what's your Plan B?

**6. Success Metrics - Process and Outcome:**
- Process metrics: What behaviors/actions will you track?
- Outcome metrics: What results would indicate progress?

**Pair Share (8 minutes):**
- Share your challenge and growth mindset plan with a partner
- Partner provides feedback using these prompts:
  - "I notice you're focusing on controllable factors like..."
  - "One thing you might also consider is..."
  - "How will you know if you need to adjust your strategy?"

**Accountability (2 minutes):**
- Exchange contact information with your partner
- Commit to checking in with each other in one week
- Brief text/message: "Did you implement your growth mindset strategy? What happened?"

---

**Facilitator Circulates (during individual work):**
- Check that students are selecting domains important to their goals
- Ensure strategies are specific and actionable (not vague)
- Confirm students include both process and outcome metrics
- Verify failure response plans are concrete

**Final Reflection (2 minutes):**

Answer individually:
- "What's the most important insight you gained from creating this plan?"
- "What's the first action you'll take this week?"

### Before Next Class (10 minutes)

**Individual Reflection & Integration (5 minutes):**

**Quick Write:**

Answer these three questions:

1. **Mindset Insight:**
What did you learn about your own mindset patterns today?

2. **PDP Connection:**
How will you integrate growth mindset into your Personal Development Plan goals?
(Specifically: Are your PDP goals "stretch goals"? Do they reflect belief you can develop new capabilities?)

3. **Immediate Action:**
What's ONE growth mindset strategy you'll apply before next week's class?

---

**Facilitator Wrapup (5 minutes):**

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Mindsets are domain-specific** - You can have growth mindset in some areas and fixed mindset in others. Target the domains that matter most for your goals.

2. **Reframing requires specificity** - Growth mindset isn't just "think positive." It's realistic acknowledgment that abilities develop through effort + strategy + help-seeking.

3. **Process focus gives you control** - When you focus on controllable processes (your strategies, effort, feedback-seeking), you maintain agency even when outcomes are uncertain.

4. **Failure is feedback** - Strategic failures are necessary for learning. The question isn't "Will I fail?" but "How will I respond when I do?"

5. **Growth mindset enables your PDP** - Your ability to achieve your development plan goals depends on believing those goals are achievable through sustained effort and effective strategies.

---

**Assignments & Preparation:**

**For Next Week (Week 10):**
1. **Implement your Growth Mindset Development Plan** - Take at least ONE action from your plan this week
2. **Read Week 10 materials** - Prepare for Guest Speaker (Ms. Ha Linh on Entrepreneurship)
3. **Mentorship Meeting 4** - If scheduled, discuss growth mindset with your mentor and get PDP feedback
4. **Optional viewing:** Carol Dweck TED Talk "The Power of Believing That You Can Improve" (10 minutes)

**Continuing Work:**
- **PDP Draft:** Continue working on your Personal Development Plan (due Week 11). Integrate growth mindset framing into your goals - ensure they're "stretch goals" that require developing new capabilities
- **Mindset Practice:** Notice your fixed mindset voice this week and practice reframing

**Tutorial Reflection Question (to ponder):**
"If you truly believed that your abilities could be developed through effort and effective strategies, what would you attempt that you're currently avoiding?"

## Facilitator Notes

### Key Teaching Moments

1. **When students say "I'm just not talented at X":**
Pause and ask: "Is that a fixed mindset statement? How would you reframe it?"

2. **When students set vague goals:**
Push for specificity: "What SPECIFIC actions will you take? When? How will you measure progress?"

3. **When students confuse growth mindset with positive thinking:**
Clarify: "Growth mindset isn't denying that something is hard - it's believing you can develop the capabilities to handle hard things through effort, strategy, and help-seeking."

4. **When students fear failure:**
Reframe: "What if failure was feedback rather than verdict? What would you try then?"

### Common Student Misconceptions

**Misconception 1:** "Growth mindset means I can become world-class at anything"
- **Correction:** Growth mindset means you can develop your capabilities further than you currently imagine within realistic constraints. Effort matters, but so do opportunity, resources, and context.

**Misconception 2:** "Growth mindset is just trying harder"
- **Correction:** It's effort + effective strategies + help-seeking. Trying harder with a bad strategy just means more ineffective practice.

**Misconception 3:** "If I have growth mindset, I should never feel discouraged"
- **Correction:** Growth mindset doesn't eliminate negative emotions. It changes how you interpret and respond to setbacks. Disappointment is natural; helplessness is optional.

### Cultural Sensitivity Notes

**Vietnamese Context:**

- **Face-saving and failure:** Vietnamese culture emphasizes "saving face" and avoiding public failure. When discussing "embracing failure," frame it as:
  - Private experimentation and learning (not public failure)
  - The Vietnamese proverb "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" (Failure is the mother of success)
  - Acknowledging that all successful professionals have learned from setbacks

- **Collective vs. individual:** Emphasize that growth mindset benefits not just the individual but their family, community, and future team. Developing capabilities serves collective goals.

- **Respect for authority:** When encouraging students to "seek feedback" and "ask questions," frame this as respectful learning, not challenging authority. Model appropriate ways to seek guidance.

### Timing Flexibility

**If running short on time:**
- Combine Parts 2 and 3 (20 minutes total): Do reframing exercise, then immediately apply to students' own challenges
- Reduce Part 4 from 20 to 15 minutes by providing partially completed template

**If time permits:**
- Add 5-minute partner practice of "responding to setbacks with growth mindset language"
- Include brief video clip from Carol Dweck TED Talk (2-3 minutes) before Part 1
