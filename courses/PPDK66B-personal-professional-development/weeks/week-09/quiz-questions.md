    question: |
      According to Dweck and Yeager (2019), what is a mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "A 'meaning system' - a set of beliefs that creates coherent patterns of goals, beliefs about effort, attributions, and behaviors"
        feedback: "Correct! Dweck and Yeager (2019) define mindset as a 'meaning system' - not an isolated belief, but a coherent set of beliefs that shapes goals (performance vs. learning), beliefs about effort (sign of weakness vs. path to mastery), attributions (fixed ability vs. improvable strategy), and behaviors (avoid challenges vs. seek challenges). Mindsets are belief systems, not personality traits or emotional states, and importantly, they can be changed."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "A personality trait that determines whether someone is optimistic or pessimistic"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Mindsets are not personality traits but belief systems. A mindset is a coherent set of beliefs about whether abilities are fixed or developable, and it shapes goals, effort beliefs, attributions, and behaviors."

      - key: "C"
        text: "An innate characteristic that cannot be changed throughout a person's lifetime"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This description contradicts the core finding of mindset research - mindsets CAN be changed. They are beliefs, not innate fixed characteristics."

      - key: "D"
        text: "A temporary emotional state influenced by recent successes or failures"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Mindsets are not temporary emotional states but relatively stable belief systems about whether abilities can be developed. However, they can be changed through intervention."

    general_feedback: |
      Understanding mindset as a belief system rather than a fixed trait is crucial for your Personal Development Plan. This means you can actively work to shift your mindset in domains where you currently hold fixed beliefs. As you design your PDP goals, consider: Are you setting goals that reflect belief in your ability to develop new capabilities, or are you limiting yourself to areas where you already feel confident?

    topic: "Fixed vs. Growth Mindset (Dweck & Yeager, 2019)"

    question: |
      Maria receives a 55% on her first business case analysis. She thinks: "I studied hard but still failed. I must not have the analytical ability for business. Maybe I should avoid advanced strategy courses." What mindset pattern is Maria demonstrating?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Fixed mindset: She attributes failure to lack of innate ability, feels helpless, and plans to avoid future challenges"
        feedback: "Correct! Maria demonstrates classic fixed mindset pattern: (1) Attributes failure to fixed trait ('I don't have the analytical ability'), (2) Views effort as evidence of inadequacy ('I studied hard but still failed' implies effort should have been enough if she had ability), (3) Experiences helpless response to setback, (4) Plans to avoid similar challenges. In growth mindset, she would interpret the 55% as feedback that her current strategies aren't working and seek to improve her approach rather than avoid the domain."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Growth mindset: She is being realistic about her current abilities and making strategic course choices"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is not growth mindset - it's fixed mindset rationalized as 'being realistic.' Growth mindset would reframe this as 'My current strategies aren't effective; I need to try different approaches' rather than avoiding the domain entirely."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Mixed mindset: She acknowledges effort but needs to try harder next time"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Maria isn't acknowledging that effort could lead to improvement - she's concluding that effort proved she lacks ability. This is fixed mindset, not mixed."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Performance mindset: She is appropriately focused on achieving good grades"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The problem isn't grade focus - it's that she attributes the grade to fixed ability rather than improvable strategy, and plans to avoid challenges. This is fixed mindset."

    general_feedback: |
      This scenario likely resonates with challenges you've faced in your own studies. When you encounter disappointing results despite effort, your mindset determines your next steps. Fixed mindset leads to avoidance; growth mindset leads to strategy adjustment. In your mentorship meetings, discuss with your mentor how they've responded to setbacks in their career - you'll likely find that successful professionals view failure as feedback, not verdict.

    topic: "Fixed vs. Growth Mindset (Dweck, 2019)"

    question: |
      Which of the following represents an effective growth mindset reframing, according to Dweck's research?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "I haven't yet developed strong public speaking skills, but I can improve through Toastmasters practice, recording myself for feedback, and learning from experienced speakers"
        feedback: "Correct! Effective growth mindset reframing includes: (1) Acknowledges current reality ('haven't yet developed'), (2) Implies future possibility ('but I can improve'), (3) Specifies concrete actions combining effort + strategy + help-seeking (Toastmasters, self-recording, learning from others). This is realistic optimism with actionable strategies, not naive positivity."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "I'm naturally talented at public speaking - I just need to believe in myself more"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This represents 'false growth mindset' - it denies current reality and focuses on positive thinking rather than concrete strategies. True growth mindset acknowledges where you are and specifies how to develop."

      - key: "C"
        text: "If I just try harder at public speaking, everything will work out fine"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This focuses only on effort without strategy or help-seeking. Dweck emphasizes that effort + effective strategies + help-seeking are all necessary, not just trying harder."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Anyone can become a world-class public speaker if they work hard enough"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This makes unrealistic claims that ignore real constraints. True growth mindset is about developing capabilities within realistic constraints, not claiming anyone can achieve anything."

    general_feedback: |
      As you work on your Personal Development Plan, ensure your goal statements follow this pattern: acknowledge where you are now, express belief in development potential, and specify concrete strategies (effort + approaches + help-seeking). Vague statements like 'I will improve my leadership' are less effective than 'I will develop leadership capabilities through leading 2 group projects, reading Leaders Eat Last, and seeking monthly feedback from my mentor.'

    topic: "Neuroplasticity"

    question: |
      What is neuroplasticity?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life"
        feedback: "Correct! Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize and form new neural connections throughout the entire lifespan, not just in childhood. This is the scientific foundation for growth mindset - abilities genuinely can be developed because the brain physically changes through practice."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "The fixed neural structure that determines intelligence at birth"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the opposite of neuroplasticity - the 20th century belief that the brain was essentially fixed. Neuroplasticity shows the brain is changeable throughout life."

      - key: "C"
        text: "The process by which the brain stops developing after age 25"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Neuroplasticity demonstrates that the brain continues forming new connections throughout life, not just until age 25."

      - key: "D"
        text: "A temporary change in brain chemistry caused by learning new information"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Neuroplasticity involves structural changes (new synaptic connections, myelin thickening) not just temporary chemical changes."

    general_feedback: |
      Neuroplasticity provides the biological basis for believing that you can develop new capabilities. When you practice a skill - whether it's Excel analysis, networking, or strategic thinking - you're not just 'getting better' in an abstract sense. You're physically changing your brain's structure. This scientific reality should give you confidence as you pursue stretch goals in your Personal Development Plan. The skills that feel foreign today can become strengths through sustained, deliberate practice.

    topic: "Neuroplasticity"

    question: |
      A student practices creating Excel pivot tables repeatedly over several weeks. Initially, it takes intense concentration and 30 minutes. Eventually, it becomes semi-automatic and takes 5 minutes. What neuroplastic changes best explain this improvement?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Synaptic connections strengthen through long-term potentiation, myelin sheaths thicken around frequently-used pathways, and neural networks optimize for efficiency"
        feedback: "Correct! This scenario illustrates neuroplasticity in action: (1) Repeated practice causes neurons that fire together to wire together (long-term potentiation strengthens synaptic connections), (2) Myelin sheaths (fatty insulation) thicken around frequently used neural pathways, speeding signal transmission, (3) Neural networks become more efficient and optimized through use. The skill becomes 'automatic' because the brain has physically restructured."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "The student's innate Excel ability finally revealed itself after initial practice removed performance anxiety"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset thinking - attributing skill development to innate ability rather than neuroplastic changes from practice."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Muscle memory in the hands and fingers developed, making the physical movements automatic"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While motor skills play a role, the primary changes are neural (brain restructuring), not just muscular."

      - key: "D"
        text: "The student memorized the exact steps, requiring no actual brain changes, just better recall"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Mere memorization doesn't explain the efficiency gains. The brain physically restructures through neuroplastic changes, not just improved recall."

    general_feedback: |
      This principle applies to ANY skill you want to develop for your career. The initial phase of learning always feels effortful and slow - that's your brain forming new neural connections. With sustained practice, those connections strengthen and the skill becomes more automatic. When you're struggling to learn something new (maybe data analytics, presentation skills, or a foreign language), remember: the struggle IS the learning. Your brain is restructuring. Persist through the difficult phase, and neuroplasticity will do its work.

    topic: "Neuroplasticity"

    question: |
      According to research on neuroplasticity, which practice approach is most likely to drive meaningful neural changes?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Focused, effortful, challenging practice with specific skills, requiring sustained attention and pushing current capabilities"
        feedback: "Correct! Neuroplasticity research shows that meaningful neural changes require: (1) Focused attention (not distracted or passive), (2) Effortful practice (pushing current capabilities creates neural demand), (3) Specificity (practicing the exact skill you want to develop), (4) Challenge (too-easy practice doesn't drive neural adaptation). This connects to growth mindset's emphasis on embracing challenges."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Easy, relaxed practice of skills already mastered, repeated frequently for reinforcement"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Simply repeating mastered skills doesn't create sufficient neural demand to drive significant neuroplastic change. Challenge is necessary."

      - key: "C"
        text: "General brain training games that supposedly improve overall cognitive function"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Research shows general brain training doesn't transfer to specific skills. Neuroplasticity requires practicing the specific skill you want to develop."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Passive exposure to information through reading or watching, without active practice"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Passive exposure doesn't create the neural demand needed for neuroplastic change. Focused, effortful, active practice is required."

    general_feedback: |
      This has important implications for how you approach skill development in your Personal Development Plan. 'Practicing' by doing things you already find easy won't create much growth. You need to consistently work at the edge of your current capabilities - that's where neuroplastic change happens. When setting practice goals (e.g., 'improve public speaking'), specify challenges that push you: 'Present to progressively larger audiences, starting with 5 people and building to 50+ people by end of semester.'

    topic: "Growth Mindset Strategies"

    question: |
      According to Yeager and Dweck (2020), effective growth mindset interventions teach three specific actions that develop abilities. What are they?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Effort (trying hard), strategy change (trying different approaches), and help-seeking (learning from others)"
        feedback: "Correct! Research-based growth mindset interventions specifically teach three concrete actions: (1) Effort - applying sustained work, (2) Strategy change - trying different approaches when current ones don't work, and (3) Help-seeking - learning from mentors, peers, and resources. This is NOT just 'try harder' (effort alone) or positive thinking (which can be passive). The combination gives students controllable actions they can take to develop abilities."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Positive thinking, self-affirmation, and visualization of success"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are components of positive psychology but not the core of research-based growth mindset interventions. Growth mindset requires concrete actions: effort, strategy change, and help-seeking."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Natural talent identification, strength leveraging, and passion pursuit"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes a strengths-based approach, not growth mindset interventions. Growth mindset focuses on developing abilities through effort, strategy, and help-seeking."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Goal-setting, time management, and performance tracking"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these are valuable skills, they're not the core of growth mindset interventions. The three key actions are effort, strategy change, and help-seeking."

    general_feedback: |
      When you face challenges in pursuing your Personal Development Plan goals, remember these three actions. If effort alone isn't working, what strategies could you try? Who could you learn from? Your mentorship program is specifically designed to support the help-seeking component - use your mentor as a resource when you encounter obstacles. In tutorial today, you'll practice applying all three actions to a current challenge you're facing.

    question: |
      Tuan wants to develop his networking abilities for his marketing career. He currently believes "I'm too introverted to be good at networking." Which approach best demonstrates growth mindset strategy application?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Tuan reframes: 'I haven't yet developed networking confidence, but I can build it through one-on-one coffee meetings, preparing conversation topics in advance, and asking his mentor for networking strategies tailored to introverts'"
        feedback: "Correct! Tuan's effective approach demonstrates: (1) Reframing fixed belief ('too introverted') to growth belief ('haven't yet developed'), (2) Effort (committing to practice), (3) Strategy (one-on-one meetings suited to his personality, preparing topics), (4) Help-seeking (asking mentor for tailored strategies). True growth mindset works WITH your current state while developing new capabilities through strategic practice."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Tuan accepts: 'I'm introverted, so I should focus on digital marketing roles that don't require much networking and play to my natural strengths'"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset avoidance - limiting career options based on belief that networking ability is fixed. Growth mindset would work to develop the capability."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Tuan decides: 'I need to force myself to attend large networking events weekly until I overcome my introversion through exposure'"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is effort without strategy, which may lead to burnout. Growth mindset requires effort + effective strategies + help-seeking, not just forcing yourself into uncomfortable situations."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Tuan thinks: 'I just need to be more confident and believe in myself - successful networkers are confident, so I should fake it until I make it'"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is false growth mindset (positive thinking without concrete strategies). True growth mindset specifies actionable strategies, not just self-belief."

    general_feedback: |
      This scenario likely resonates with domains where you hold fixed beliefs. Perhaps you think 'I'm not technical,' 'I'm not creative,' or 'I'm not a leader.' The growth mindset approach isn't denying your starting point - it's believing you can develop capabilities through strategic action. In today's tutorial, you'll identify one domain where you hold a fixed belief and create a concrete development plan using effort + strategy + help-seeking. Your mentor can be especially valuable for the help-seeking component.

    topic: "Growth Mindset Strategies"

    question: |
      Which statement best exemplifies "process praise" that reinforces growth mindset, rather than "trait praise" that reinforces fixed mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "You tried multiple approaches before finding one that worked - that persistence and strategy adjustment is what led to your success"
        feedback: "Correct! Process praise attributes success to controllable factors: persistence, strategy adjustment, effort. This builds confidence that success can be replicated through similar approaches in future challenges. Process praise focuses on what the person DID (controllable); trait praise focuses on what the person IS (perceived as unchangeable)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "You're so naturally talented at this - you're just a smart person"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is trait praise that reinforces fixed mindset. It attributes success to innate characteristics, which creates fear of challenges that might disprove the trait."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Great job! You're really gifted and this comes easily to you"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is trait praise emphasizing innate gifts. While well-intentioned, it reinforces fixed mindset by suggesting success comes from fixed traits rather than controllable actions."

      - key: "D"
        text: "I knew you could do it - you've always been good at things like this"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is trait praise suggesting success comes from stable, unchanging characteristics ('you've always been good'). Process praise would focus on specific strategies used."

    general_feedback: |
      Apply this to your own self-talk. When you succeed at something, do you think 'I'm smart' or 'I used effective strategies'? The first creates pressure to always appear smart (fixed mindset). The second builds confidence in your ability to succeed through strategic effort (growth mindset). As you work with your mentorship program partner or study groups, practice giving process praise to peers: 'I noticed you tried several different approaches to that problem - that persistence paid off' rather than 'You're so smart!'

    topic: "Career Resilience & Reskilling"

    question: |
      According to Yeager and Dweck (2020), mindsets can be domain-specific. What does this mean?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "You can have growth mindset about some areas (e.g., academic skills) and fixed mindset about other areas (e.g., interpersonal skills)"
        feedback: "Correct! Domain-specificity means mindsets vary across different areas of life. You might have strong growth mindset about technical skills ('I can learn Python') but fixed mindset about creative abilities ('I'm not creative'). This is important because: (1) Don't assume your mindset is uniform, (2) Identify specific domains where fixed beliefs are limiting you, (3) Target growth mindset cultivation to domains most important for your goals."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Your mindset is determined by your specific career domain or industry"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Domain-specific means you can have different mindsets in different areas of YOUR life, not that mindset is determined by career domain."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Mindsets only apply to specific academic subjects, not to broader life domains"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Mindsets apply to all domains of life (academic, professional, interpersonal, creative, athletic, etc.), and can vary across these domains."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Once you develop growth mindset in one area, it automatically transfers to all other areas"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is the opposite of domain-specificity. Mindsets don't automatically transfer - you can have growth mindset in one area but fixed mindset in another."

    general_feedback: |
      In today's tutorial, you'll complete a domain-specific mindset assessment. You'll likely discover you have growth mindset in some areas but fixed mindset in others. The key is identifying which domains with fixed mindsets are actually important for your career goals. If you want to be a marketing manager but have fixed mindset about interpersonal skills ('I'm not a people person'), that belief will limit your career. Your Personal Development Plan should target developing capabilities in domains where fixed beliefs are currently holding you back.

      Linh graduated with a traditional marketing degree but now, three years into her career, finds that data analytics skills are increasingly required for marketing roles. She thinks "I'm a creative person, not a data person - this isn't for me." Which statement best describes the career risk of this fixed mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Linh limits her career opportunities by avoiding developing data skills, causing her marketing expertise to stagnate as the field evolves, reducing her career resilience in the AI era"
        feedback: "Correct! Linh's fixed mindset ('I'm creative, not analytical') creates career vulnerability: (1) She avoids learning valuable skills the field requires, (2) Her expertise becomes less relevant as marketing becomes data-driven, (3) She reduces career options and resilience when AI and technology reshape work (Week 1 connection). Growth mindset alternative: 'I'm currently stronger in creative than analytical skills, but I can develop data capabilities through coursework, practice, and mentorship.'"
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Linh is being realistic and should focus on pure creative marketing roles that don't require analytics, playing to her natural strengths"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset rationalized as 'being realistic.' In the AI era, playing to strengths alone without developing new capabilities is risky as fields evolve. Most marketing roles now require both creative and analytical skills."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Linh should immediately switch careers entirely to a field that doesn't require technical skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is extreme avoidance based on fixed mindset. Rather than switching careers, Linh should develop data skills to remain competitive in her chosen field."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Linh's fixed mindset doesn't matter because creative skills are more valuable than analytical skills in marketing"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Modern marketing requires both creative AND analytical skills. The highest-value roles combine these capabilities. Linh's fixed mindset limiting her analytical development is a career risk."

      This scenario reflects the central challenge of Week 1's 'Future of Work' content meeting Week 9's 'Growth Mindset' content. As AI and technology reshape industries, professionals must continuously reskill. Your Personal Development Plan should include goals for developing capabilities your field increasingly requires, even if they feel foreign now. In mentorship meetings, ask your mentor: 'What new skills have you had to develop as your industry evolved? How did you approach learning something that initially felt outside your comfort zone?'

    question: |
      How does growth mindset specifically enable self-regulated learning across the lifespan, according to the research covered in Week 9?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Growth mindset provides the motivational foundation to persist through challenges because you believe effort and strategy changes will lead to improvement, making goal-setting, monitoring, and adjustment worthwhile"
        feedback: "Correct! Growth mindset enables self-regulated learning (Week 4 connection) by providing motivational foundation: IF you believe abilities can be developed through effort and strategy, THEN it's worth setting learning goals, monitoring progress, adjusting strategies when needed, and persisting through difficulty. Fixed mindset undermines self-regulation: 'If I can't improve, why persist when it's hard?' Growth mindset doesn't make learning easy - it changes your RESPONSE to difficulty."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Growth mindset makes learning feel easy and effortless, eliminating the need for self-regulation strategies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Growth mindset doesn't make learning effortless - it changes how you respond to difficulty and effort. Self-regulation strategies are still necessary; growth mindset just motivates you to apply them."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Growth mindset automatically improves memory and cognitive processing speed, enhancing learning efficiency"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Growth mindset doesn't directly improve cognitive functions. It's a belief system that motivates persistent, strategic learning, which then leads to capability development through neuroplasticity."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Growth mindset replaces the need for specific learning strategies because positive thinking is sufficient"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This represents false growth mindset. True growth mindset doesn't replace learning strategies - it motivates you to seek and apply effective strategies persistently."

    general_feedback: |
      This connection between Week 4 (Self-Managed Learning) and Week 9 (Growth Mindset) is crucial for your Personal Development Plan. Self-regulated learning strategies (goal-setting, monitoring, adjustment) only work if you believe they'll lead to improvement. As you pursue your 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year PDP goals, you'll encounter obstacles and setbacks. Growth mindset is what enables you to persist, adjust strategies, and continue developing rather than giving up when progress feels slow. Your mindset is the foundation for all other development strategies.
