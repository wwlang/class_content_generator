    topic: "Growth vs. Fixed Mindset"

    question: |
      According to Carol Dweck's research, what is the fundamental difference between fixed and growth mindsets?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Fixed mindset believes abilities are static and unchangeable; growth mindset believes abilities can be developed through effort and learning"
        feedback: "Correct! This is the core distinction in Dweck's mindset theory—whether you view abilities as fixed traits or developable capacities."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Fixed mindset focuses on short-term goals; growth mindset focuses on long-term goals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While growth mindset may support long-term development, the distinction is about whether abilities are changeable, not goal timelines."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Fixed mindset means you never fail; growth mindset means you embrace failure"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Fixed mindset doesn't prevent failure—it changes how you interpret failure (as permanent verdict vs. temporary feedback)."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Fixed mindset is pessimistic thinking; growth mindset is positive thinking"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Growth mindset isn't just positive thinking—it's the belief that strategic effort develops abilities. It requires action, not just optimism."

    general_feedback: |
      Dweck defines **fixed mindset** as the belief that abilities are innate and unchangeable—you're either good at something or you're not. **Growth mindset** is the belief that abilities are developable through effort, effective strategies, and help-seeking. This distinction shapes how you approach challenges, interpret failure, and respond to feedback. Growth mindset doesn't mean "everyone can do anything"—it means abilities can develop with strategic work. See Week 9 slides 5-7.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Growth vs. Fixed Mindset"

    question: |
      How does mindset create a "meaning system" that affects behavior?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Mindset shapes your goals (performance vs. learning), effort beliefs (threat vs. path to growth), and responses to setbacks (give up vs. adjust strategy)"
        feedback: "Correct! Mindset isn't just a belief—it creates coherent patterns of goals, effort interpretation, and behavioral responses to challenges."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Mindset determines your personality type and cannot be changed"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Mindset is distinct from personality and CAN be changed through awareness and practice. You're not 'a fixed mindset person.'"

      - key: "C"
        text: "Mindset only affects your thoughts, not your actual behavior"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Research shows mindset directly affects behavior—whether you seek challenges, persist after failure, and seek feedback."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Mindset creates meaning only in academic contexts, not professional ones"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Mindset research spans 74 nations and affects career outcomes including challenge-seeking, persistence, and career advancement."

    general_feedback: |
      Dweck & Yeager (2019) describe mindset as a **meaning system** that creates coherent patterns. Fixed mindset leads to **performance goals** (look smart), viewing **effort as evidence of inadequacy**, and **giving up after setbacks**. Growth mindset leads to **learning goals** (become smarter), viewing **effort as path to mastery**, and **persisting with new strategies** after setbacks. Your mindset shapes whether you avoid or embrace challenges throughout your career. See Week 9 slide 6.

    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Growth Mindset Research Evidence"

    question: |
      What did the National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM) demonstrate about growth mindset interventions?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "A short intervention (<1 hour) teaching that intelligence is developable improved grades and increased advanced course enrollment, especially for lower-achieving students"
        feedback: "Correct! The NSLM is the largest mindset study (12,000+ students) and showed that brief interventions can change behavior by changing beliefs."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Only students who already had high intelligence benefited from growth mindset teaching"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The opposite is true—effects were strongest for lower-achieving students who needed to develop skills most."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Growth mindset interventions require years of therapy to be effective"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The NSLM intervention was less than 1 hour and produced lasting behavioral changes. It's about changing beliefs, not extensive therapy."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Growth mindset only works for children, not adults"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While the NSLM studied ninth graders, neuroplasticity research shows adults can develop new skills throughout their lifespan."

    general_feedback: |
      The **National Study of Learning Mindsets** (Dweck & Yeager, 2019) tested a 45-minute online intervention with over 12,000 ninth graders across 65 U.S. schools. Students learned that intelligence is developable through effort, strategies, and help-seeking. Results showed **improved grades** (equivalent to moving from B- to B+), **increased enrollment in advanced courses**, and **effects that persisted over time**. Critically, effects were strongest for lower-achieving students. This demonstrates that changing core beliefs about ability can change behavior and outcomes. See Week 9 slide 8.

  - id: "W9-Q4-neuroplasticity"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Neuroplasticity"

    question: |
      What does neuroplasticity research tell us about learning and skill development?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "The brain forms new neural connections when learning; repeated practice strengthens these pathways, meaning abilities develop through use across your lifespan"
        feedback: "Correct! Neuroplasticity is the scientific foundation supporting growth mindset—your brain literally changes structure when you learn."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Brain development stops after age 25, so you can only use existing abilities"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While some aspects of brain development complete around age 25, neuroplasticity continues throughout life. Adults can learn new skills."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Only people with high IQ can benefit from neuroplasticity"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Neuroplasticity is a universal brain feature. Everyone's brain forms new connections when learning, regardless of IQ."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Neuroplasticity means learning should always be easy and effortless"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The opposite is true—struggle and challenge drive neural growth. Difficulty is the mechanism of development, not evidence of inability."

    general_feedback: |
      **Neuroplasticity** is the brain's ability to reorganize and strengthen neural connections through experience. When you practice a skill, neurons fire and form pathways. **Repeated practice strengthens these connections** through myelination (making signals travel faster). This means abilities are not fixed at birth—they develop through use. The struggle you feel when learning something difficult is your brain forming new connections. This is why **"your brain is like a muscle"** is scientifically accurate. Neuroplasticity supports reskilling and career transitions at any age. See Week 9 slides 11-14.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "applying"
    topic: "Learning from Failure"

    question: |
      You receive a D grade on an important exam. Which response demonstrates growth mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "\"This study strategy didn't work. I need to use active recall instead of passive reading, form a study group, and attend office hours before the next exam.\""
        feedback: "Correct! This reframes failure as feedback about strategy (controllable) rather than ability (perceived as fixed). It leads to specific adjustments."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "\"I'm just not smart enough for this subject. I should change my major.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset—interpreting the grade as permanent verdict on ability rather than feedback on strategy."

      - key: "C"
        text: "\"The professor is unfair and grades too harshly. There's nothing I can do.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. While external factors can exist, attributing everything externally prevents learning and improvement. Focus on controllable factors."

      - key: "D"
        text: "\"I worked really hard, so the D is okay because effort is all that matters.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is 'false growth mindset'—effort without effective strategy doesn't produce results. You need to adjust your approach, not just try harder."

    general_feedback: |
      Growth mindset interprets failure as **feedback about strategy**, not **verdict about ability**. The Failure Analysis Framework separates **controllable factors** (study methods, time management, preparation) from **uncontrollable factors** (professor difficulty, test format). Fixed mindset says "I failed → I'm inadequate." Growth mindset says "This approach didn't work → I need different strategies." The Vietnamese proverb "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" (Failure is the mother of success) reflects this growth-oriented interpretation. See Week 9 slides 16-19.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "evaluating"
    topic: "False Growth Mindset"

    question: |
      Which statement represents "false growth mindset" rather than authentic growth mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "\"You worked so hard on this project! Great effort!\" (said to someone whose ineffective strategy produced poor results)"
        feedback: "Correct! This is false growth mindset—praising effort regardless of strategy or outcomes. Real growth mindset praises effective processes, not just effort."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "\"I see you tried a new strategy—breaking the material into chunks and using practice tests. That approach paid off with better results.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is AUTHENTIC growth mindset—praising process (effort + effective strategy) and linking it to outcomes."

      - key: "C"
        text: "\"You can develop this skill through strategic effort, though external factors also affect outcomes.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is authentic growth mindset—acknowledging that abilities are developable while recognizing real constraints."

      - key: "D"
        text: "\"You struggled with this because your current strategy wasn't effective. Let's try active learning techniques instead of passive reading.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is authentic growth mindset—attributing difficulty to strategy (changeable) and suggesting specific adjustments."

    general_feedback: |
      Dweck warns against **false growth mindset**: (1) **Just praising effort** regardless of strategy or outcomes—effort without effective approaches doesn't produce growth; (2) **"Everyone can do anything"** oversimplification—ignoring real constraints and resources; (3) **Positive thinking without action**—saying "I believe I can improve" without actually changing strategies or seeking help. **Authentic growth mindset** = believing abilities develop through **effort + effective strategies + help-seeking**, not effort alone. See Week 9 slide 27.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "analyzing"
    topic: "Learning from Failure - Dweck Example"

    question: |
      When researchers questioned whether growth mindset interventions work (2016-2018), how did Carol Dweck respond, and what does this demonstrate?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "She asked \"What can we learn from this controversy?\" and conducted larger, pre-registered replications—demonstrating growth mindset by learning from criticism"
        feedback: "Correct! Dweck practiced what she preaches—treating criticism as feedback for improvement rather than threat to defend against."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "She defended her original theory and dismissed critics as wrong"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This would be fixed mindset (protecting ego). Instead, she acknowledged limitations and improved interventions based on feedback."

      - key: "C"
        text: "She abandoned mindset research entirely because of the criticism"
        feedback: "Incorrect. She persisted but adjusted her approach—growth mindset means persistence with strategic adjustment, not giving up."

      - key: "D"
        text: "She ignored the controversy and continued with the same interventions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. She actively engaged with criticism, identified 'false growth mindset' problems, and improved interventions. Growth mindset requires strategic adjustment."

    general_feedback: |
      When mindset research faced criticism, Dweck demonstrated **growth mindset in action**. Instead of defensive fixed mindset ("My theory is being attacked"), she asked **"What can we learn?"** She acknowledged **limitations in some implementations**, identified **"false growth mindset"** as a problem, conducted **larger pre-registered replications** to address concerns, and **improved interventions** based on feedback (Yeager & Dweck, 2020). This is the essence of growth mindset: treating challenges and criticism as opportunities to learn and improve. See Week 9 slide 17.

  - id: "W9-Q8-reskilling-definition"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Reskilling and Career Adaptability"

    question: |
      What is the difference between upskilling and reskilling, and why do both require growth mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Upskilling develops new skills within your current field; reskilling learns skills for a different role. Both require believing you CAN learn what you don't currently know"
        feedback: "Correct! Both require growth mindset—the belief that abilities are developable through strategic effort, whether deepening existing expertise or pivoting to new domains."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Upskilling is for young professionals; reskilling is for people over 40"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Age doesn't determine which type you need. Upskilling and reskilling are defined by whether you're developing within your field or pivoting to a new one."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Upskilling is easy and quick; reskilling is impossible for most people"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both can be challenging, and neuroplasticity research shows reskilling is neurologically possible at any age with strategic effort."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Upskilling requires growth mindset; reskilling requires fixed mindset"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both require growth mindset! Reskilling especially requires believing you can develop abilities outside your current expertise."

    general_feedback: |
      **Upskilling** = developing new skills within your current field (e.g., accountant learns data analytics, marketer learns AI tools). **Reskilling** = learning skills for a different role or career (e.g., teacher transitions to corporate training, engineer moves to product management). The **World Economic Forum (2025)** reports 23% of jobs will change in the next 5 years, with average skill half-life of ~5 years. Both upskilling and reskilling require **growth mindset**—believing you can learn what you don't currently know, even outside your comfort zone. See Week 9 slides 21-23.

  - id: "W9-Q9-reskilling-strategies"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "applying"
    topic: "Reskilling Strategies"

    question: |
      You want to transition from finance to sustainability consulting but have no environmental background. Which approach demonstrates growth mindset and effective reskilling strategy?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "\"I'll build environmental knowledge through online courses, join Vietnam Green Building Council as volunteer, and apply my finance skills to green finance projects to transition over 2 years.\""
        feedback: "Correct! This demonstrates growth mindset (knowledge is developable) and strategic reskilling (using multiple learning methods, building credibility, leveraging existing skills)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "\"I don't have an environmental degree, so I can't make this transition. I'll stay in traditional finance.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset—viewing lack of formal credentials as permanent disqualifier rather than knowledge gap you can fill through learning."

      - key: "C"
        text: "\"I'll just believe I can do it and apply to sustainability jobs without building any environmental knowledge.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is false growth mindset—positive thinking without strategic action. Growth mindset requires actually developing the needed skills, not just believing."

      - key: "D"
        text: "\"I'll quit my finance job immediately and hope to learn sustainability on the job.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. While growth mindset supports career transitions, strategic reskilling involves building skills BEFORE or DURING transition, not hoping to learn after."

    general_feedback: |
      This example from Week 9 lectures demonstrates **growth mindset applied to career transitions**. Fixed mindset says "I don't have the background → I can't do it." Growth mindset says "I need to build this knowledge" and creates a **strategic reskilling plan**: (1) **Learn** through structured courses; (2) **Practice** through volunteer work; (3) **Bridge** by applying existing skills (finance) to new domain (green finance); (4) **Transition** gradually over realistic timeframe. Neuroplasticity supports career transitions at any stage. See Week 9 slide 23.

    topic: "Cultivating Growth Mindset"

    question: |
      You're working on a skill you've always struggled with (public speaking) and feel yourself thinking \"I'm just not good at this.\" Which strategy best demonstrates applying growth mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Replace \"I'm not good at this\" with \"I haven't developed this skill yet. I'll practice by presenting in small settings, joining Toastmasters, and seeking specific feedback.\""
        feedback: "Correct! This combines self-talk reframing (\"yet\"), seeking deliberate practice opportunities, and using feedback—all core growth mindset strategies."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Just think positively—\"I'm great at public speaking!\"—without practicing or seeking feedback"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is false growth mindset—positive affirmations without strategic action. Growth mindset requires actually developing skills, not just positive self-talk."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Avoid all public speaking situations so you never have to face this weakness"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset avoidance. Growth mindset seeks challenges that develop capabilities, even when uncomfortable."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Work harder at public speaking by repeating the same ineffective approach multiple times"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Growth mindset isn't just effort—it's effort + effective strategies. You need to change your approach, not just try harder at ineffective methods."

    general_feedback: |
      Developing growth mindset requires **multiple strategies**: (1) **Change self-talk**—add "yet" to "I can't" statements; (2) **Focus on process**—celebrate improvement, not just outcomes; (3) **Seek challenges intentionally**—volunteer for stretch opportunities; (4) **Learn from others' success**—ask about strategies, not just admire talent; (5) **Reflect on growth**—document what you couldn't do 6 months ago that you can do now. Growth mindset is a **practice**, not a one-time belief. See Week 9 slide 28.

    topic: "Applying Growth Mindset to PDP"

    question: |
      When writing your Personal Development Plan, which goal statement best demonstrates growth mindset?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "\"By July 2026, I will develop data analysis skills (currently limited) by completing Google Data Analytics certificate, practicing on 5 real datasets, and using these skills in my internship to expand my career options beyond non-technical roles.\""
        feedback: "Correct! This is SMART, growth-oriented (develops weak area), specific about strategy, and expands capabilities rather than limiting to existing strengths."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "\"I will only apply to jobs that fit my natural strengths so I don't have to work on my weaknesses.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset—avoiding development of weak areas and limiting yourself to current capabilities."

      - key: "C"
        text: "\"I hope to improve my skills if I work hard enough.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This lacks specificity (which skills?), measurability (how will you know?), and strategy (what actions?). It's vague hoping, not strategic planning."

      - key: "D"
        text: "\"I won't set ambitious goals because I might fail and that would prove I'm not capable.\""
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is fixed mindset—avoiding challenge to protect self-image. Growth mindset sees failure as feedback, not verdict, so embraces challenging goals."

    general_feedback: |
      Your **Personal Development Plan** should reflect growth mindset throughout. When setting goals, ask: "What skills do I need to **develop**?" not "What am I already good at?" Frame weaknesses as **developable gaps**, not permanent limitations. Set **challenging but achievable** goals that require learning. Include **specific strategies** (courses, practice, mentors), not just effort. Remember: Your PDP assumes you can develop into someone you're not yet—that's the essence of growth mindset.

    topic: "Growth Mindset in Vietnamese Cultural Context"

    question: |
      How does Vietnamese cultural emphasis on education and hard work relate to growth mindset, and what potential tension exists?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Vietnamese culture's emphasis on effort and persistence supports growth mindset; potential tension exists around 'saving face' culture making public failure difficult to embrace as learning opportunity"
        feedback: "Correct! Vietnamese cultural strengths align with growth mindset, but face-saving norms may require reframing failure as private feedback rather than public shame."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Vietnamese culture is entirely fixed mindset and cannot support growth mindset principles"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Vietnamese proverbs like 'Có công mài sắt có ngày nên kim' (effort turns iron to needle) strongly support growth mindset."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Vietnamese culture focuses only on natural talent, ignoring the role of effort"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Vietnamese educational culture heavily emphasizes hard work and persistence—core growth mindset values."

      - key: "D"
        text: "There is no cultural context to consider—growth mindset is universal and identical across cultures"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While growth mindset principles are universal, cultural context shapes how you approach failure, challenge, and public vs. private learning."

    general_feedback: |
      Vietnamese culture offers **strong foundations** for growth mindset: emphasis on hard work, persistence ("Có công mài sắt có ngày nên kim"), and continuous improvement. The proverb "Thất bại là mẹ thành công" (Failure is the mother of success) reflects growth-oriented thinking. **Potential tension** exists around **face-saving culture**—public failure may feel more threatening in collectivist contexts. **Balancing both**: honor cultural emphasis on effort and persistence while creating **safe spaces for learning from mistakes** and reframing failure as **private feedback** rather than public shame. See Week 9 slide 30.
