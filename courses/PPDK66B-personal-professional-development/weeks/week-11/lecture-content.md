# Designing Your Personal Development Plan

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 11. This week is the culmination of our entire semester—students will use everything they've learned to create their comprehensive Personal and Professional Development Plan, due Friday, November 28. This lecture provides the goal-setting frameworks and planning tools they need to design a strategic 1-3-5 year career roadmap.

# 90%

**of people who set specific goals fail to achieve them**

Because they skip the critical steps we'll learn today

*(Locke & Latham, 2002)*

<speaker-notes>
Key moment - this statistic typically surprises students who think goal-setting is simple. The good news: research shows exactly why 90% fail and how the 10% succeed. This lecture teaches the evidence-based frameworks that separate effective goal-setters from wishful thinkers. Today's content directly enables students to complete their 40% Personal Development Plan assignment due this Friday.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** SMART goal criteria to create specific, measurable career goals
2. **Explain** Locke & Latham's goal-setting theory and its four performance mechanisms
3. **Design** OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) for personal development
4. **Construct** a SWOT analysis identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
5. **Create** a 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year career development roadmap

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are assessed in the Personal Development Plan (40% of final grade) due Friday. Emphasize that students should be working on their PDPs as the lecture proceeds—this is practical, applied content. Tutorial today provides dedicated PDP work time with instructor support.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You

**Personal Development Plan (40%) - Due Friday, November 28, 11:59 PM**

Today's lecture teaches:
- Part 3: Vision & Goals (SMART goals, OKRs, 1-3-5 year roadmaps)
- Part 2: SWOT Analysis & Skills Gap Analysis
- Part 5: Implementation & Accountability

**Final Oral Exam (30%) - Exam Period**
- You'll present your PDP using frameworks learned today

<speaker-notes>
The stakes are high—this is the most heavily weighted assessment in the course. Students should have draft PDPs started; today's lecture provides the final tools they need. Tutorial time is explicitly dedicated to PDP completion with instructor and peer feedback. Remind students that mentor validation statements (Meeting 4) should be completed this week as well.

</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Part 1 Opening">

# Part 1: The Science of Goal-Setting

**What makes goals work—and why most people fail**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to Part 1. We begin with foundational theory from Locke & Latham (2002)—the most influential research in goal-setting psychology. This 35-year empirical research program explains why specific, difficult goals outperform "do your best" intentions. Students need to understand the "why" before learning the "how" frameworks.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" title="Goal-Setting Theory: The Foundation">

## Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham, 2002)

**Core Principle:** Specific, difficult goals lead to higher performance than vague or easy goals

**Research Base:**
- 35 years of empirical studies
- 7,243+ citations
- Effect sizes: 0.42 to 0.80 (large)

**Key Finding:** "Do your best" goals are consistently outperformed by specific targets

<speaker-notes>
Locke and Latham's research is the gold standard in goal-setting psychology. The effect sizes (0.42-0.80) are unusually large for social science—meaning goal-setting has a powerful, reliable impact on performance. Students should understand that "I'll do my best" is scientifically proven to be less effective than "I will achieve X by Y date." This validates the structured PDP approach.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Four Mechanisms of Goal Performance">

## How Goals Improve Performance

Locke & Latham identify **4 mechanisms** through which goals enhance achievement:

1. **Direction** → Goals direct attention toward goal-relevant activities (and away from distractions)

2. **Effort** → Higher goals mobilize greater effort

3. **Persistence** → Goals increase persistence over time

4. **Strategies** → Goals prompt development of task-relevant strategies and action plans

<speaker-notes>
Key pedagogical moment. These four mechanisms explain WHY goal-setting works at a cognitive and motivational level. Example for students: "If your goal is 'become a good marketer' (vague), you might scroll LinkedIn, attend random events, or read articles without strategy. If your goal is 'Complete Google Analytics certification by March 2026' (specific, difficult), you direct attention to certification materials, mobilize effort to study weekly, persist through difficult modules, and develop a study strategy."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="When Goals Work Best: Moderators">

## When Do Goals Work Best?

Goals are most effective when these **moderators** are present:

**Adequate Feedback**
- You can measure progress toward goals
- You receive information about how you're performing

**High Goal Commitment**
- You're personally invested in the goal
- The goal aligns with your values

**Sufficient Ability**
- You have (or can develop) the skills needed
- Resources are available

**Appropriate Task Complexity**
- Task isn't so complex it overwhelms
- Or: complex tasks are broken into sub-goals

<speaker-notes>
Critical for PDP design. Students should evaluate their goals against these moderators. "Do I have feedback mechanisms?" (Yes—mentor check-ins, quarterly reviews). "Am I committed?" (Goals should align with values from Week 5 assessments). "Do I have ability?" (Or a plan to develop it—that's the skills gap analysis). "Is complexity managed?" (Break 5-year goals into 1-year and 3-year sub-goals).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Goal-Setting Theory Applied">

## Applying Goal-Setting Theory to Your PDP

| Principle | Application to PDP |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Specific goals** | Not "improve communication"—"Present at 3 NEU conferences by July 2026" |
| **Difficult goals** | Stretch beyond comfort zone—but remain achievable |
| **Feedback** | Build in progress checks: mentor meetings, quarterly reviews, tracking systems |
| **Commitment** | Align goals with VIA strengths, MBTI preferences, Holland Code interests |
| **Ability** | Include skill development in action steps—don't assume you're ready now |
| **Complexity** | Break 5-year goals into 3-year, then 1-year sub-goals |

<speaker-notes>
Bridge from theory to practice. Students should be taking notes on how to strengthen their draft PDPs. Common question: "What if I don't know if my goal is achievable?" Answer: That's what mentors are for—use Meeting 4 to validate goal feasibility. Another common concern: "My 5-year goals feel too ambitious." Response: That's appropriate—5-year goals should be difficult. Break them into smaller 1-year and 3-year milestones.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="section-break" title="Part 2 Opening">

# Part 2: Goal-Setting Frameworks

**Practical tools: SMART goals, OKRs, and career roadmaps**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to Part 2. Now that students understand WHY goals work (theory), we move to HOW to design effective goals (frameworks). This section is intensely practical—students should be able to immediately apply these frameworks to their PDPs. We'll cover two complementary systems: SMART goals (for clarity and structure) and OKRs (for ambitious objectives with measurable results).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="framework" title="SMART Goals Framework">

## SMART Goals Framework

A proven framework for creating well-formed goals:

**S - Specific:** Clearly defined, not vague or ambiguous
- Bad: "Improve my marketing skills"
- Good: "Complete Google Digital Marketing certification"

**M - Measurable:** Can track progress and know when achieved
- Bad: "Get better at public speaking"
- Good: "Present at 3 NEU student conferences"

**A - Achievable:** Challenging but realistic given resources
- Bad: "Become CMO of Fortune 500 company by 2027" (from student position)
- Good: "Secure marketing coordinator role at established firm by 2027"

**R - Relevant:** Aligns with values, career vision, strengths
- Bad: "Learn coding" (if you're passionate about HR and hate tech)
- Good: "Earn SHRM-CP certification" (if pursuing HR career)

**T - Time-bound:** Has a specific deadline or timeframe
- Bad: "Eventually get my MBA"
- Good: "Apply to MBA programs by October 2028"

<speaker-notes>
Walk through each criterion with good/bad examples. Students often write vague goals ("improve skills") that don't meet SMART criteria. Emphasize that SMART goals are required in PDP Part 3—minimum 3 short-term (1-year), 2 medium-term (3-year), and 1 long-term (5-year) goal, all in SMART format. Common student question: "How do I make a big goal measurable?" Answer: Define specific milestones (e.g., "Become an expert in data analytics" → "Complete 3 advanced Excel courses and analyze 10 real datasets by December 2026").
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="SMART Goals in Higher Education">

## Research: SMART Goals in Higher Education

**Martins van Jaarsveld et al. (2025)** - Systematic review of 60 studies (2010-2024)

**Key Findings:**
- SMART goal interventions are increasingly common (50%+ published in past 5 years)
- Most effective when **embedded in course activities** (not one-time exercises)
- **Extended prompts** (multiple sessions) outperform single-session activities
- Digital delivery effective for tracking and accountability

**Implication for Your PDP:** Setting goals once isn't enough—you need ongoing monitoring and adjustment (that's why accountability mechanisms are required in Part 5)

<speaker-notes>
This research validates the PDP approach. NEU's PPDK66B embeds goal-setting across 12 weeks (not a one-shot activity): Week 5 self-assessments inform goals, Week 11 designs PDP, Final Oral Exam ensures accountability. Students should understand that research shows their PDP will be more effective than typical New Year's resolutions because of this structured, extended approach. The digital submission (Google Form) + mentor check-ins + oral exam presentation are the accountability mechanisms research recommends.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="OKR Framework Introduction">

## OKRs: Objectives and Key Results

Originally developed at Intel, now used by Google, LinkedIn, and leading organizations

**Structure:**
- **Objective:** Qualitative, inspirational goal (the "what" and "why")
- **Key Results:** 2-4 quantitative measures of success (the "how you'll know")

**Example Organizational OKR:**
- **Objective:** Become the top choice for new graduates in Vietnam
- **Key Results:**
  1. Increase job applications from top universities by 40%
  2. Achieve 90% offer acceptance rate
  3. Reach 4.5+ rating on Glassdoor

<speaker-notes>
Introduce OKR as a complement to SMART goals. SMART goals are concrete and tactical; OKRs are ambitious and strategic. Students may ask: "Why learn OKRs if we have SMART goals?" Answer: OKRs help with BIG objectives (like your 5-year vision) that require multiple measures of success. SMART goals work well for specific actions ("Complete certification by June"); OKRs work well for broad objectives ("Build expertise in sustainable business") with multiple pathways.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="Personal OKRs for Development Plans">

## Adapting OKRs for Personal Development

**Personal OKR Example (1-Year):**

**Objective:** Establish myself as a capable marketing professional ready for post-graduation roles

**Key Results:**
1. Complete 3 industry-recognized certifications (Google Analytics, HubSpot, Meta Blueprint)
2. Lead marketing campaigns for 2 student organizations with measurable results
3. Build portfolio with 5 case studies demonstrating campaign strategy and analysis
4. Secure 2 informational interviews per month with marketing professionals

<speaker-notes>
This is how students adapt organizational OKRs to personal development. The Objective is aspirational and directional; Key Results are specific, measurable outcomes that collectively achieve the objective. Students might ask: "How is this different from 4 separate SMART goals?" Answer: OKRs create coherence—the 4 key results are strategically linked to one overarching objective. In your PDP, you might use OKR structure for each time horizon (1-year OKR, 3-year OKR, 5-year OKR) with key results that are themselves SMART goals.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="OKR Research and Best Practices">

## OKR Implementation: Research Insights

**Al-Saadi et al. (2023)** - Study of OKR-based performance system in higher education

**Affordances (Benefits):**
- Clear objective-setting with measurable key results
- Alignment between personal goals and broader context
- Enhanced focus and prioritization
- Regular progress tracking

**Challenges:**
- Requires bi-directional understanding (you need to understand your OKRs AND how to evaluate progress)
- Organizational context matters (your career field shapes what's realistic)
- Needs clear alignment between individual objectives and career goals

**Application:** Use OKRs for your 3-year and 5-year goals where you need multiple measures of success

<speaker-notes>
Al-Saadi's research is one of the few peer-reviewed studies on OKRs in academic contexts. The "challenges" section helps students avoid common pitfalls. Key insight: OKRs work best when you understand both how to set them AND how to track them—that's why PDP Part 5 (Implementation & Accountability) is critical. Students should use OKRs for complex, multi-faceted objectives (e.g., "Become a leader in sustainable business") and SMART goals for specific milestones (e.g., "Complete LEED Green Associate certification by August 2026").
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="framework" title="Building Your Career Roadmap">

## 1-Year, 3-Year, 5-Year Career Roadmap

**Structure Your Goals Across Time Horizons:**

**1-Year Goals (Short-Term):** Foundation building
- Skills: Certifications, courses, technical capabilities
- Experience: Internships, projects, leadership roles
- Network: Mentors, informational interviews, professional communities

**3-Year Goals (Medium-Term):** Career establishment
- Position: First professional role, early promotions
- Expertise: Recognized competence in 1-2 specialty areas
- Reputation: Known in your field, expanding network

**5-Year Goals (Long-Term):** Career advancement
- Leadership: Management role or senior specialist position
- Impact: Measurable contributions to organization/field
- Direction: Clear career trajectory, strategic choices

<speaker-notes>
This is the core structure for PDP Part 3. Students must include minimum 3 short-term (1-year), 2 medium-term (3-year), and 1 long-term (5-year) SMART goals. The roadmap should show logical progression—1-year goals build foundation for 3-year goals, which enable 5-year goals. Example progression: Year 1 "Complete financial modeling certification" → Year 3 "Financial analyst role at Big 4 firm" → Year 5 "Senior analyst managing client portfolio." Common student concern: "5 years feels so far away, I don't know what I'll want then." Response: That's expected—5-year goals can evolve. The exercise forces strategic thinking about long-term direction.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Career Roadmap Example">

## Sample Career Roadmap: Marketing Professional

**1-Year Goals (Graduate Ready):**
1. Complete Google Analytics, HubSpot, Meta Blueprint certifications
2. Lead 2 student org marketing campaigns with documented results
3. Build portfolio with 5 professional case studies
4. Secure 10+ informational interviews with industry professionals

**3-Year Goals (Established Professional):**
1. Digital marketing specialist at reputable agency or in-house team
2. Managed 3+ successful campaigns with measurable ROI
3. Known in NEU alumni network as go-to marketing professional
4. Begin developing expertise in one specialty (SEO, paid ads, content, analytics)

**5-Year Goals (Senior Professional):**
1. Marketing manager role leading a team or senior specialist in chosen niche
2. Track record of 10+ successful campaigns with business impact
3. Regular speaker/contributor in Vietnamese marketing community
4. Mentoring junior marketers

<speaker-notes>
Walk through how this roadmap demonstrates logical progression and increasing scope. Year 1 builds skills and portfolio; Year 3 applies skills in professional role and develops specialty; Year 5 takes on leadership and industry recognition. Students should notice: goals become broader and more ambitious over time, key results shift from learning to doing to leading, specificity decreases appropriately for longer time horizons. Encourage students to create similar roadmaps for their own career fields during tutorial time.

<slide number="19" layout="section-break" title="Part 3 Opening">

# Part 3: Self-Assessment & Planning

**SWOT analysis, accountability, and implementation**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to Part 3. Students now have goal-setting frameworks (SMART goals and OKRs) and understand career roadmap structure. Part 3 provides the final critical pieces: SWOT analysis for self-awareness, and accountability mechanisms for implementation. This completes the toolkit needed to finalize their PDPs before Friday's deadline.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="framework" title="SWOT Analysis for Personal Development">

## SWOT Analysis for Personal Development

A strategic self-assessment framework with four quadrants:

**STRENGTHS (Internal, Positive)**
What advantages do you have?
- VIA Character Strengths, CliftonStrengths, MBTI preferences
- Skills, knowledge, experience, network
- Resources (financial, educational, family support)

**WEAKNESSES (Internal, Negative)**
What areas need development?
- Skill gaps identified in self-assessments
- Limiting beliefs or fixed mindsets
- Resource constraints, knowledge gaps

**OPPORTUNITIES (External, Positive)**
What favorable conditions exist?
- Growing industries in Vietnam (tech, green economy, digital transformation)
- NEU resources (career services, alumni network)
- Mentor connections, emerging trends

**THREATS (External, Negative)**
What obstacles or challenges exist?
- AI disruption in your field
- Economic uncertainty, competitive job market
- Industry changes, geographic constraints

<speaker-notes>
SWOT is required in PDP Part 2 (15% of PDP grade). Students must list 5-7 items per quadrant. Key teaching point: Strengths and Weaknesses are INTERNAL (things you control); Opportunities and Threats are EXTERNAL (things in your environment). Common student error: listing "lack of job opportunities" as a Weakness—that's actually a Threat. Another error: listing generic items ("hard-working," "competitive market")—push for specificity. Good Strength: "Top 5 VIA strength in Creativity, proven through 3 award-winning campaigns." Good Threat: "Rise of AI marketing tools may reduce demand for entry-level content writers by 2027 (McKinsey, 2024)."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="SWOT Analysis in Action">

## Using SWOT to Inform Your Goals

**Strategic Alignment:**

**Strengths + Opportunities = Growth Strategies**
- Leverage your strengths to capitalize on opportunities
- Example: "My CliftonStrength 'Learner' + growing AI field = pursue AI certifications"

**Strengths + Threats = Defensive Strategies**
- Use strengths to mitigate threats
- Example: "My EI competence + AI disruption = position myself in human-AI collaboration roles"

**Weaknesses + Opportunities = Development Strategies**
- Overcome weaknesses to seize opportunities
- Example: "My weak networking + NEU alumni network = attend 2 alumni events per month"

**Weaknesses + Threats = Contingency Strategies**
- Address weaknesses to reduce vulnerability to threats
- Example: "My limited tech skills + AI disruption = complete data analytics bootcamp"

<speaker-notes>
This is advanced SWOT application—teaching students to use SWOT strategically, not just as a list-making exercise. The four combinations (S+O, S+T, W+O, W+T) should inform goal selection. Students might ask: "How does this relate to my goal-setting?" Answer: Your SMART goals should address these strategic priorities. If your biggest threat is AI disruption and your biggest weakness is tech skills, then one of your 1-year goals should address that gap. SWOT provides the "why" behind your goal choices—it's the situational analysis that justifies your strategic direction.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Accountability Mechanisms">

## Building Accountability into Your Plan

Research shows goals fail without accountability systems (Locke & Latham, 2002). Your PDP requires:

**Tracking Systems:**
- Progress journals (weekly reflections)
- Digital tools (Notion, Trello, Google Sheets)
- Visual trackers (roadmap posters, milestone charts)

**Social Accountability:**
- Share goals with mentor, family, trusted friends
- Join accountability groups (study buddies, professional networks)
- Scheduled check-ins (monthly mentor coffee, quarterly self-reviews)

**Milestone Celebrations:**
- Recognize progress at key points
- Reward completion of difficult sub-goals
- Build positive reinforcement loops

**Review & Adjustment:**
- Quarterly reviews: Am I on track? What needs to change?
- Annual major review: Update 3-year and 5-year goals
- Bi-annual mentor check-ins for external perspective

<speaker-notes>
PDP Part 5 (Implementation & Accountability) is 10% of PDP grade. Students must specify HOW they will maintain accountability. Common student mistake: writing vague statements ("I will stay motivated" or "I will check my progress regularly"). Push for specificity: "I will review my goals every Sunday evening for 15 minutes and update my progress spreadsheet" or "I will schedule quarterly coffee meetings with my mentor to review milestones." Key insight: Accountability is as important as goal-setting itself—the 90% who fail often have good goals but poor accountability.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Implementation Timeline">

## Creating Your Implementation Timeline

**PDP Part 5 requires detailed timelines:**

**Year 1 (Detailed):**
- Month-by-month action plan
- Specific deadlines for each milestone
- Resource acquisition dates (certifications, courses, materials)

**Years 2-3 (Moderate Detail):**
- Quarter-by-quarter milestones
- Major accomplishments per quarter
- Skill development phases

**Years 4-5 (High-Level):**
- Annual milestones
- Major career transitions
- Long-term positioning goals

**Example Year 1 Month-by-Month:**
- January 2026: Enroll in Google Analytics course
- February 2026: Complete 50% of course + apply for summer internships
- March 2026: Finish certification, interview prep
- April-May 2026: Secure internship
- June-August 2026: Complete internship, collect case study data

<speaker-notes>
Students should leave this lecture ready to create their timeline. The level of detail decreases appropriately over longer time horizons—you can plan January 2026 in detail, but August 2029 will necessarily be less specific. Common student question: "What if my plans change?" Answer: That's expected and healthy. The timeline creates intentionality and structure; you'll adjust as you go. Annual reviews should include timeline updates. The exercise forces strategic thinking about sequencing—what must happen in Year 1 to enable Year 3 goals?
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="24" layout="section-break" title="Wrap-Up">

## Key Takeaways

<speaker-notes>
Transition to wrap-up. We've covered substantial material—goal-setting theory, SMART goals, OKRs, career roadmaps, SWOT analysis, and accountability mechanisms. Now summarize the most critical points students need to apply to their PDPs.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Key Takeaways">

## Today's Key Takeaways

1. **Goals work because of 4 mechanisms:** Direction, Effort, Persistence, Strategies (Locke & Latham)

2. **SMART goals require all 5 criteria:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

3. **OKRs combine qualitative objectives with quantitative key results** for complex, multi-faceted goals

4. **Career roadmaps progress logically:** 1-year builds foundation → 3-year establishes career → 5-year advances to leadership

5. **SWOT analysis informs goal selection:** Use strengths to seize opportunities, address weaknesses that create vulnerability

6. **Accountability mechanisms are non-negotiable:** Tracking systems, social accountability, reviews, and adjustments

<speaker-notes>
These are the six essential principles students must apply in their PDPs. Emphasize that tutorial today provides dedicated time to work on PDPs with instructor support. Students should come to tutorial with draft goals ready for peer and instructor feedback. Remind them: PDP is due Friday, November 28, 11:59 PM—only 3 days after this lecture. Time to finalize is limited.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="Assessment Reminders">

## Assessment Reminders

**Personal Development Plan (40%) - Due Friday, November 28, 11:59 PM**
- Submit via Google Form (link on course management system)
- All 6 parts required: Self-Assessment Integration, SWOT, Vision & Goals, Mentor Integration, Implementation, Reflection
- Include mentor validation statement from Meeting 4
- Minimum 3 short-term + 2 medium-term + 1 long-term SMART goals

**Final Oral Exam (30%) - Exam Period**
- 15-minute presentation: 10-min presentation + 5-min Q&A
- Present your PDP using frameworks from today
- Professional slides (10-12 slides maximum)
- Submit slides 24 hours before your scheduled time

<speaker-notes>
Logistical reminders. Students should note the tight deadline—PDP due Friday. Emphasize that late submissions are penalized 10% per day, with no submissions accepted after December 2. For students who haven't completed Mentorship Meeting 4 yet, they must do so this week to get mentor validation statements. Oral exam scheduling will be announced next week—students should start preparing their presentations now (even before PDP submission) since exam period arrives quickly after semester ends.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" title="Tutorial Today">

## Tutorial: PDP Work Session

**Today's Tutorial (90 minutes):**

**Structure:**
1. Opening Q&A on lecture content (15 min)
2. Individual PDP work time with instructor support (60 min)
3. Optional peer feedback exchange (15 min)

**What to Bring:**
- Draft PDP (any sections completed so far)
- Self-assessment results (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, EI, Holland Code)
- Mentor feedback notes from all 4 meetings
- Laptop for working on PDP

**Goal:** Leave tutorial with 80%+ complete PDP ready for final polishing

<speaker-notes>
Tutorial is structured as a working session, not a lecture. Students should come prepared to work. Instructor circulates to provide individual feedback and answer questions. Common tutorial questions to anticipate: "Is this goal specific enough?", "How do I know if my 5-year goal is realistic?", "Should I use SMART or OKR format?", "How many items in my SWOT is enough?" Be prepared to give rapid, concrete feedback to help students finalize their plans. Encourage peer feedback exchange—students can help each other identify vague goals or provide accountability partner suggestions.

<slide number="28" title="Next Week Preview">

## Next Week: Integration & Continuous Growth

**Week 12 - Final Class:**
- Synthesis of the entire semester's learning
- Values-career alignment frameworks
- Systems thinking and personal mastery
- Continuous improvement strategies
- Course reflections and looking forward

**No new major assignments** - focus is on integration and preparing for Final Oral Exams

<speaker-notes>
Week 12 is the final class before exam period. It's designed as a capstone integration week—connecting all course concepts (self-awareness from Week 5, reflection from Week 3, growth mindset from Week 9, goal-setting from today) into a coherent personal development philosophy. The lecture introduces systems thinking and continuous improvement mindsets that students will use throughout their careers. It's a celebratory, reflective session—students should come ready to share their journeys and insights from the semester.
