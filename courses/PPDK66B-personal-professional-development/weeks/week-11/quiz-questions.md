    topic: "Goal-Setting Theory"

    question: |
      What are the four mechanisms through which goals improve performance according to Locke & Latham's goal-setting theory?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Direction, Effort, Persistence, Strategy Development"
        feedback: "Correct! These four mechanisms explain how specific, difficult goals activate psychological processes that improve performance."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Planning, Execution, Monitoring, Evaluation"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are general project management phases, not the four mechanisms identified by Locke & Latham."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Awareness, Commitment, Action, Reflection"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these are important for goal achievement, they are not Locke & Latham's four mechanisms."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Vision, Mission, Values, Strategy"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are strategic planning components, not the psychological mechanisms of goal-setting theory."

    general_feedback: |
      Locke & Latham's goal-setting theory identifies four mechanisms: (1) <b>Direction</b> (focusing attention on goal-relevant activities), (2) <b>Effort</b> (higher goals mobilize greater effort), (3) <b>Persistence</b> (goals increase sustained effort over time), and (4) <b>Strategy Development</b> (challenging goals prompt task-specific planning). When all four mechanisms activate <b>simultaneously</b> (at the same time), goal achievement probability increases dramatically. See Week 11 slides 6-7.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Goal-Setting Theory"

    question: |
      How do the four moderators (feedback, commitment, task complexity, ability) affect goal achievement?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Goals are most effective when all four moderators are present; missing moderators reduce goal effectiveness"
        feedback: "Correct! The moderators are conditions that must be met for goals to work optimally. Each moderator strengthens the goal-performance relationship."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Moderators replace the four mechanisms; you need either mechanisms or moderators"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Moderators don't replace mechanisms. Mechanisms explain HOW goals work; moderators are CONDITIONS needed for goals to work effectively."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Only commitment matters; the other three moderators have minimal impact"
        feedback: "Incorrect. All four moderators are important. For example, without feedback, you can't adjust strategies; without adequate ability, goals become impossible and undermine commitment."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Moderators only apply to organizational goals, not personal development goals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Moderators apply to all goal contexts. Your PDP goals need feedback systems, personal commitment, manageable complexity, and alignment with your abilities."

    general_feedback: |
      Moderators are <b>contextual factors</b> (conditions in the environment or person) that determine WHEN goal-setting works best. Think of mechanisms as the engine (how goals work) and moderators as the fuel/conditions (what makes the engine run optimally). Goals with high feedback, high commitment, appropriate complexity, and adequate ability show the strongest performance effects. Missing moderators weaken goal effectiveness. See Week 11 slide 7.

    topic: "Goal-Setting Theory"

    question: |
      How do specific, difficult goals differ from "do your best" goals according to goal-setting theory?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Specific, difficult goals activate all four mechanisms (direction, effort, persistence, strategy); 'do your best' goals activate none effectively"
        feedback: "Correct! Specific, difficult goals have effect sizes of d = 0.42-0.82, while 'do your best' serves as baseline performance."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "'Do your best' goals are more motivating because they're flexible and reduce performance anxiety"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Research shows the opposite. 'Do your best' lacks the specificity to direct attention or the challenge to mobilize effort."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Both goal types are equally effective; the difference is only in how goals are communicated"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Over 400 studies show specific, difficult goals consistently outperform 'do your best' goals with medium to large effect sizes."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Specific goals work for simple tasks; 'do your best' works better for complex tasks"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While complex tasks may need breaking into sub-goals, specific difficult goals still outperform vague 'do your best' goals regardless of task complexity."

    general_feedback: |
      The <b>core finding</b> (fundamental discovery) of goal-setting theory is that specific, difficult goals <b>consistently</b> (reliably, across 400+ studies) lead to higher performance than 'do your best' goals. Example: 'Achieve TOEIC 900 by June 2026' (specific + difficult) activates direction (focus on TOEIC preparation), effort (study 10+ hours/week), persistence (continue through setbacks), and strategy (identify weak areas, use practice tests). 'Do my best in English' activates none of these effectively. See Week 11 slides 5-6.

    topic: "SMART Goals Framework"

    question: |
      What does the acronym SMART stand for in the SMART goals framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound"
        feedback: "Correct! These five criteria ensure goals are well-formed and activate goal-setting theory mechanisms."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Strategic, Motivating, Actionable, Realistic, Trackable"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these are desirable goal qualities, this is not the standard SMART acronym used in goal-setting research."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Simple, Meaningful, Ambitious, Rewarding, Timely"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is not the SMART framework. The correct version includes Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Structured, Manageable, Aspirational, Relevant, Transparent"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While some of these qualities are beneficial, this is not the SMART acronym. S = Specific, not Structured."

    general_feedback: |
      The SMART framework was introduced by George Doran in 1981 and has been validated by 60+ empirical studies. Each component addresses a common goal-setting mistake: <b>Specific</b> (fixes vague goals), <b>Measurable</b> (enables progress tracking), <b>Achievable</b> (maintains commitment), <b>Relevant</b> (ensures values alignment), <b>Time-bound</b> (creates urgency). All five criteria must be present for a goal to be truly SMART. See Week 11 slides 9 and 12.

  - id: "W11-Q5-smart-specific"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SMART Goals Framework"

    question: |
      Why is the "Specific" component essential in SMART goals?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Specificity activates the Direction mechanism by focusing attention on particular goal-relevant activities"
        feedback: "Correct! Specific goals answer 'What exactly?' and focus effort, directly linking to Locke & Latham's Direction mechanism."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Specificity makes goals easier to achieve by reducing the scope of work required"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Specificity doesn't make goals easier—it makes them clearer. Goals should still be difficult (challenging) to maximize performance."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Specificity is only important for short-term goals; long-term goals can remain vague"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While 3-5 year goals may use OKR format (Objective + Key Results), the Key Results must still be specific and measurable."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Specificity reduces flexibility, which is why 'do your best' goals often work better"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Research shows specific goals consistently outperform vague goals. While specificity does reduce flexibility, this focus is what drives performance."

    general_feedback: |
      The Specific component answers: What exactly? Which aspect? What outcome? This <b>clarity</b> (clearness, lack of ambiguity) activates the Direction mechanism from goal-setting theory—your attention and effort focus on particular activities. Example: 'Improve public speaking' (vague) vs. 'Deliver 8 presentations with 4.0/5.0 average feedback score by December 2026' (specific). The second version directs you toward presentation opportunities, feedback collection, and skill practice. See Week 11 slides 12-13.

  - id: "W11-Q6-smart-measurable"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SMART Goals Framework"

    question: |
      How does the Measurable component of SMART goals support the Feedback moderator from goal-setting theory?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Measurement provides quantifiable progress indicators, enabling tracking and adjustment—which is the Feedback moderator"
        feedback: "Correct! Measurable goals enable progress monitoring ('I've completed 3 of 8 presentations'), which provides feedback for strategy adjustment."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Measurable goals guarantee success because numbers are always accurate"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Measurement enables tracking but doesn't guarantee success. You still need commitment, adequate ability, and effective strategies."

      - key: "C"
        text: "The Measurable component replaces the need for feedback; once goals are measurable, external feedback is unnecessary"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Measurable goals enable self-monitoring, but external feedback (from mentors, peers, supervisors) remains valuable for identifying blind spots."

      - key: "D"
        text: "All goals must use numerical metrics; qualitative outcomes cannot be measured"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While quantitative metrics are common, some goals have clear pass/fail criteria (e.g., 'Successfully defend thesis proposal') that are measurable without numbers."

    general_feedback: |
      Measurable goals answer: How much? How many? How will I know when it's accomplished? This enables the Feedback moderator—you can track progress and adjust strategies. Without measurement, you can't tell if you're on track. Example: 'Network more' (unmeasurable) vs. 'Conduct 12 <b>informational interviews</b> (conversations with professionals to learn about their careers) by June 2026, tracking in spreadsheet' (measurable). The second version lets you monitor 'I've done 5/12 interviews' and accelerate if behind. See Week 11 slides 12 and 14.

  - id: "W11-Q7-smart-pitfall"
    type: "true_false"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SMART Goals Framework"

    question: |
      True or False: A goal that states "Complete 3 online courses in data analytics" is a fully SMART goal because it is specific about the number of courses (3) and the topic (data analytics).

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "False"
        feedback: "Correct! This goal measures ACTIVITY (completing courses) rather than ACHIEVEMENT (what you can do with the knowledge). It also lacks a deadline (Time-bound) and doesn't specify measurable outcomes beyond course completion."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "True"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While the goal has some specificity (3 courses, data analytics topic), it falls into the 'Activity ≠ Achievement' pitfall. A better version: 'Complete 3 data analytics courses AND build a portfolio project analyzing Vietnam's e-commerce trends using Python by December 2026, published on GitHub.' This version specifies both learning AND application with a deadline."

    general_feedback: |
      Common pitfall: Measuring activity (inputs) rather than achievement (outputs). Completing courses is an activity; being able to APPLY data analytics skills is the achievement. A truly SMART goal specifies what you'll be able to DO differently, not just what you'll complete. Other missing components: no deadline (Time-bound), unclear how you'll demonstrate <b>competency</b> (ability to perform a skill). See Week 11 slide 19.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "OKR Framework"

    question: |
      What are the two components of the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Objective (qualitative aspiration) and Key Results (quantitative metrics proving achievement)"
        feedback: "Correct! Objectives answer 'WHAT do I want to achieve?' (aspirational); Key Results answer 'HOW will I know I achieved it?' (measurable proof)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Overall goal and Key Resources needed to achieve it"
        feedback: "Incorrect. OKR stands for Objectives and Key RESULTS (measurable outcomes), not Key Resources. Results are outcomes; resources are inputs."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Objective statement and Key Requirements for success"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The R in OKR stands for Results (measurable outcomes), not Requirements. Key Results are how you measure achievement."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Outcome goals and Key Responsibilities assigned to team members"
        feedback: "Incorrect. OKR is Objectives (aspirations) and Key Results (metrics), not responsibilities. OKRs can be individual or organizational."

    general_feedback: |
      OKR framework separates <b>aspiration</b> (the inspiring direction you're heading) from <b>measurement</b> (how you'll know you got there). Objective: Qualitative, inspiring (e.g., 'Become recognized expert in sustainable business strategy'). Key Results: Quantitative, measurable proof (e.g., 'Publish 3 articles, speak at 2 conferences, advise 5 companies'). Typically 2-5 Key Results per Objective. OKRs work well for 3-5 year goals where exact specificity is difficult. See Week 11 slides 12 and 21.

  - id: "W11-Q9-okr-vs-smart"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "OKR Framework"

    question: |
      How do OKRs differ from SMART goals in structure and purpose?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "SMART goals are flat (individual independent goals); OKRs are hierarchical (one Objective with multiple Key Results that ladder up to it)"
        feedback: "Correct! SMART goals stand alone; OKRs show how multiple measurable outcomes (Key Results) connect to a larger aspiration (Objective)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "SMART goals are for short-term planning; OKRs are completely different and cannot be used together"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SMART and OKR frameworks are complementary. Best practice: Use SMART for 1-year goals, OKR for 3-5 year goals, and Key Results are essentially SMART goals."

      - key: "C"
        text: "OKRs are superior to SMART goals and should always be used instead"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The frameworks serve different purposes. OKRs provide architecture (connecting multiple goals to broader objectives); SMART ensures individual goals are well-formed."

      - key: "D"
        text: "SMART goals require measurement; OKRs do not because Objectives are qualitative"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While Objectives are qualitative, Key Results MUST be quantitative and measurable. OKRs actually require rigorous measurement through Key Results."

    general_feedback: |
      SMART goals are <b>flat</b> (having no hierarchy or layers) — each goal is independent. OKRs are <b>hierarchical</b> (organized in levels or layers) — multiple Key Results connect to one Objective. Best practice for PDPs: Use BOTH. 1-year: 3 SMART goals. 3-year: 1 Objective + 2-3 Key Results (which are SMART goals). 5-year: 1 Objective + 1-2 Key Results. The OKR structure shows PROGRESSION across time horizons. See Week 11 slide 22.

    type: "true_false"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "OKR Framework"

    question: |
      True or False: In the OKR framework, achieving 100% of your Key Results indicates your Objective was optimally ambitious.

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "False"
        feedback: "Correct! Google's OKR philosophy: If you achieve 100% of Key Results, your Objective wasn't ambitious enough. Target 60-70% achievement to encourage stretch thinking."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "True"
        feedback: "Incorrect. OKRs are designed to be ambitious—60-70% achievement is considered success. Achieving 100% suggests the Key Results weren't sufficiently challenging. The purpose is to stretch capabilities, not guarantee 100% completion."

    general_feedback: |
      OKRs embrace <b>ambitious</b> (challenging, requiring significant effort) goal-setting. Achieving 60-70% of Key Results means the Objective pushed you beyond your comfort zone—which drives growth. This differs from academic grading where 60-70% is poor performance. In OKR context, 100% achievement suggests you played it safe. For your PDP: It's okay if your 5-year Objective feels audacious—that's intentional. See Week 11 slides 12 and 21.

  - id: "W11-Q11-swot-quadrants"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Personal SWOT Analysis"

    question: |
      What are the four quadrants of a personal SWOT analysis?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Strengths (internal positive), Weaknesses (internal negative), Opportunities (external positive), Threats (external negative)"
        feedback: "Correct! SWOT divides factors into internal (you control) vs. external (environmental), and positive (advantages) vs. negative (challenges)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Skills, Work Experience, Opportunities, Training Needs"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes career development components, not SWOT quadrants. SWOT is: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Self-Assessment, Work Values, Objectives, Timeline"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are PDP components, not SWOT quadrants. SWOT analyzes: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Strengths, Weaknesses, Objectives, Resources"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The S and W are correct, but O = Opportunities (not Objectives) and T = Threats (not Resources)."

    general_feedback: |
      SWOT divides factors into two dimensions: <b>Internal vs. External</b> (within your control or in the environment) and <b>Positive vs. Negative</b> (advantages or challenges). Strengths/Weaknesses are internal (your skills, traits). Opportunities/Threats are external (market trends, competition). For PDPs: Strengths come from self-assessments (VIA, CliftonStrengths, MBTI); Opportunities come from labor market research (Vietnam digital economy growth, AI-era skills demand). See Week 11 slides 15 and 21.

  - id: "W11-Q12-swot-application"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Personal SWOT Analysis"

    question: |
      How should personal SWOT analysis inform goal-setting in a Personal Development Plan?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Goals should leverage Strengths, address Weaknesses, capture Opportunities, and mitigate Threats"
        feedback: "Correct! SWOT grounds goals in reality—using advantages you have, developing gaps, seizing market opportunities, and preparing for challenges."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "SWOT is only for self-reflection; it should not influence goals because goals should focus on aspirations regardless of current strengths"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While goals should be ambitious, they must be grounded in reality. Ignoring SWOT leads to unrealistic goals that violate the Achievable criterion of SMART."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Goals should only focus on Weaknesses because Strengths are already developed and don't need attention"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Effective development leverages Strengths (what you naturally do well) while also addressing critical Weaknesses. Research shows playing to strengths increases engagement and success."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Opportunities and Threats should be ignored in personal planning because they are external and unpredictable"
        feedback: "Incorrect. External factors shape career viability. Goals must align with market realities (Opportunities) and prepare for challenges (Threats). Example: Ignoring AI disruption (Threat) leads to obsolete career plans."

    general_feedback: |
      SWOT creates a <b>strategic foundation</b> (reality-based starting point) for goal-setting. Example: Strength = 'Strong analytical thinking (VIA Judgment + CliftonStrengths Analytical)'; Opportunity = 'Data analytics demand in Vietnam growing 25% annually'; Goal = 'Complete Google Data Analytics certification and apply skills in 2 business intelligence projects by December 2026' (leverages strength + captures opportunity). Goals disconnected from SWOT are <b>wishful thinking</b> (hoping without basis in reality). See Week 11 slides 15 and 21.
