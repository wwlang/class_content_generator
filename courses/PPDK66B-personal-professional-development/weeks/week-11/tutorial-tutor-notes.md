## Introduction (5 minutes)

**Opening Script:**

"Welcome to Week 11. Your Personal Development Plan—worth 40% of your course grade—is due Friday at 11:59 PM. That's [X] days from now.

Show of hands: How many of you have complete drafts of all six PDP sections?"

*[Expect 30-50% will raise hands]*

"Good. For those who don't, today's tutorial helps you assemble missing pieces and quality-check what you have.

This is your LAST workshop before submission. No Week 12 tutorial—that's exam prep only. If you leave today with incomplete drafts, you're on your own.

Today's goals:
1. Make all goals truly SMART (not just labeled SMART)
2. Verify integration across all six parts (golden thread)
3. Get peer feedback using rubric criteria
4. Create final revision plan

Let's work efficiently. Questions before we start?"

**Attendance:**
- Mark attendance quickly
- Note students without drafts (may need individual check-in)

**Set Expectations:**
- This is WORK time, not lecture time
- Phones away, laptops open, focused effort
- Peer review is mandatory—opt-out not allowed

---

## Activity 1: SMART Goals Quality Check (25 minutes)

**Objective:** Students test every goal against all 5 SMART criteria and revise goals that fail.

**Setup (2 minutes):**
- Display SMART criteria on board/screen (from tutorial-content.md)
- Remind students: Most people LABEL goals SMART without making them SMART
- Today we fix that

**Individual Work (15 minutes):**
- Students work through SMART Goals Quality Check Template
- They test EACH of their 6+ goals against all 5 criteria
- Goals that fail ANY criterion must be revised

**Circulation Strategy:**
- Spend first 10 minutes circulating, spot-checking goals
- Identify common failures (usually Specific or Measurable)
- Provide on-the-spot coaching

**Common Issues & Interventions:**

**Issue 1: "Improve English" labeled SMART because student added deadline**
- Goal: "Improve English by December 2026"
- **Problem:** Not specific (improve which aspect?), not measurable (how much improvement?)
- **Fix:** "Achieve IELTS 7.5 by June 2026 through weekly tutoring (40 sessions), daily vocabulary practice (180 days tracked), and monthly practice tests to monitor progress"

**Issue 2: Goal is specific but not achievable**
- Goal: "Become CEO of Fortune 500 company by 2028"
- **Problem:** Unrealistic given student is undergraduate in 2025
- **Fix:** "Reach senior analyst or team leader role at consulting firm by 2028 through promotion after 2 years of strong performance, completion of MBA part-time, and leadership of 3 major client projects"

**Issue 3: Goal is SMART but not Relevant**
- Goal: "Run marathon in under 4 hours by October 2026"
- **Problem:** If PDP vision is "business analytics career," this is unrelated
- **Intervention:** Ask "How does this serve your career vision?" If it's wellbeing/balance goal, that's fine—but explain relevance. If no connection, remove or revise.

**Issue 4: Too many metrics (goal becomes unwieldy)**
- Goal: "Complete Google Analytics cert with 95% average, apply in 3 projects with 4.5/5.0 client satisfaction, publish 2 LinkedIn articles about learning with 100+ views, and present findings at NEU student conference by December 2026"
- **Problem:** Multiple goals crammed into one
- **Fix:** Split into 2-3 separate goals OR simplify metrics

**Issue 5: 3-5 year goals too tactical**
- 5-Year Goal: "Complete Excel advanced course"
- **Problem:** That's 1-year goal level; 5-year should be strategic (position, expertise, impact)
- **Fix:** "Lead data analytics function at Vietnam tech startup, managing team of 3-5 analysts and driving $500K+ revenue impact through data-driven decision-making"

**Group Checkpoints (5 minutes):**
- After 15 min individual work, pause for group checkpoint
- Ask: "How many goals did you revise? Show of hands if 0... 1-2... 3-4... 5+?"
- Expect most students revised 2-4 goals
- Share one common fix you observed while circulating

**Finalizing (3 minutes):**
- "You should now have 6+ goals that pass ALL five SMART criteria."
- "If any goal still fails, FLAG IT for office hours this week."
- "Your peer reviewer will check these in Activity 3."

---

## Activity 2: Integration Audit (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Students verify connections between PDP parts (golden thread audit).

**Setup (2 minutes):**
- Integration is THE difference between A and C grade PDPs
- Excellent PDPs tell ONE coherent story across all six parts
- Weak PDPs have six disconnected sections

**Individual Mapping (10 minutes):**
- Students complete Integration Mapping Template
- They trace connections: Self-assessments → SWOT → Goals → Mentor feedback → Implementation
- They identify gaps where sections don't align

**Circulation Strategy:**
- Look for RED FLAGS:
  - **Red Flag 1:** SWOT Strengths are generic ("hardworking," "creative") not tied to specific assessments
  - **Red Flag 2:** Goals don't connect to SWOT (missed opportunities)
  - **Red Flag 3:** Mentor feedback isolated in Part 4, not integrated into goals/SWOT
  - **Red Flag 4:** Vision statement doesn't match goal direction (vision says "social impact," goals say "investment banking")

**Intervention Examples:**

**Weak Integration (Disconnected):**
- Part 1: VIA strengths = Creativity, Curiosity, Love of Learning
- Part 2: SWOT Strengths = "Good communication, hardworking, team player" (no mention of Creativity/Curiosity)
- Part 3: Goals = "Pass IELTS 7.5, get internship at bank, improve GPA" (none leverage creativity)
- **Problem:** Self-assessments not informing strategy

**Strong Integration (Connected):**
- Part 1: VIA strengths = Creativity, Curiosity, Love of Learning + Holland Code = Artistic-Investigative-Enterprising
- Part 2: SWOT Strengths = "Creative problem-solving (VIA Creativity), analytical thinking (Holland Investigative), innovation-focused (AIE code)"
- Part 3: Goal = "Design and test 3 innovative marketing campaigns for real clients by December 2026, achieving average 4.0/5.0 creativity rating from client feedback" (leverages Creativity + Artistic)
- **Why Better:** Clear thread from assessment → SWOT → goal

**Peer Review Preparation (8 minutes):**
- Students pair up for integration check
- Partner reviews Integration Map and asks 5 audit questions (from tutorial-content.md)
- Partner identifies ONE integration strength and ONE gap
- Students note gaps to address before submission

**Group Debrief (2 minutes):**
- "What integration gaps did your partner identify?"
- Common answers: SWOT not tied to assessments, goals don't leverage strengths, mentor feedback not integrated
- "You have until Friday to fix these. Don't submit disconnected sections."

---

## Activity 3: Peer Review Using Rubric (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Comprehensive PDP review using Assessment Handbook rubric criteria.

**Setup (3 minutes):**
- This is the BIG quality check
- Students exchange COMPLETE PDP drafts
- They use rubric-based review protocol to evaluate all six parts
- Feedback must be SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE (not "looks good")

**Partner Assignment Strategy:**
- Pair students with someone OUTSIDE their usual friend group (fresh eyes)
- Avoid pairing strongest with weakest (mismatch in feedback quality)
- If odd number, create one group of 3 (two reviewers per PDP)

**Review Time (15 minutes):**
- Students complete Peer Review Protocol form (tutorial-content.md)
- They evaluate all six parts using checklist + quality rating
- They identify top 3 strengths and top 3 revision priorities

**Circulation — Quality Control:**
- Circulate to ensure reviews are SUBSTANTIVE
- Weak peer review = checking boxes and writing "good job"
- Strong peer review = specific feedback on EACH part + predicted grade range

**Red Flag Reviews (Intervene Immediately):**
- Review completed in <10 minutes (too fast, superficial)
- No specific feedback provided (only checkboxes)
- All "Excellent" ratings with no suggested improvements (unrealistic unless truly exceptional)
- Predicted grade A for PDP with obvious gaps

**Intervention Script:**
"I notice you rated this PDP as Excellent across all sections. Let me spot-check a few goals. [Review 2 goals] This goal doesn't pass all SMART criteria—it's not measurable. And this goal has no deadline—not time-bound. Please revise your review to identify these gaps so your partner can fix them before Friday."

**Review Exchange (5 minutes):**
- Reviewers share feedback with authors
- Authors ask clarifying questions
- Authors note top 3 revision priorities

**Revision Time (7 minutes):**
- Based on feedback, students make immediate revisions to 1-2 critical issues
- They flag remaining issues for revision tonight/tomorrow
- They add items to Final Revision Action Plan

---

## Activity 4: Revision Plan & Submission Checklist (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Students create action plan for final revisions and complete submission checklist.

**Setup (2 minutes):**
- Based on peer feedback, you know what needs fixing
- Now create SPECIFIC plan with timeline
- Don't overcommit—be realistic about time available before Friday

**Individual Planning (10 minutes):**
- Students complete Final Revision Action Plan
- They identify Priority 1 (MUST FIX), Priority 2 (SHOULD FIX), Priority 3 (NICE TO FIX)
- They assign time estimates and deadlines to each
- They complete Pre-Submission Checklist

**Reality Check Circulation:**
- Ask students: "How many hours do you estimate for all revisions?"
- If student says "10 hours" and it's Thursday, INTERVENE
- Help prioritize ruthlessly: "You can't do everything. Focus on what loses the most points."

**Common Time Estimates (Based on Experience):**
- Revising 3 goals to be truly SMART: 1-2 hours
- Adding integration connections between parts: 30-60 min
- Obtaining mentor validation: 24-48 hours (mentor response time)
- Writing 200-word reflection: 30 min
- Proofreading entire PDP: 45-60 min
- Total for typical student with solid draft: 3-5 hours

**Mentor Validation Crisis Management:**
- Ask: "How many of you have mentor validation statement already?"
- Expect 40-60% will NOT have it yet
- Provide email template (see below)
- Emphasize: Send TODAY, not Thursday night

**Mentor Validation Email Template (Display or Handout):**
```
Subject: PDP Review Request — Validation Statement Needed by [Date]

Dear [Mentor Name],

Thank you for your guidance this semester. My Personal Development Plan is due Friday, November 28, and I need your help with the final requirement.

Could you please:
1. Review the attached PDP draft (focus on goals and overall direction)
2. Provide a 50-100 word validation statement confirming:
   - You reviewed the plan
   - It reflects our mentorship discussions
   - You support my career direction

I need this by [Thursday evening] to include in my final submission. If you have any concerns about the plan, please let me know so I can revise.

Thank you again for your mentorship this semester.

Best regards,
[Student Name]
```

**Checklist Completion (3 minutes):**
- Students complete Pre-Submission Checklist
- Count checked boxes
- If <80% checked, student is at risk—flag for office hours

**Group Poll:**
- "How many have >90% of checklist complete?" [Raise hands]
- "How many have 70-90% complete?"
- "How many have <70% complete?" [These students need intervention]

---

## Handling Common Student Issues

**Issue 1: Student Arrives Without Any Drafts**

**Symptoms:** Shows up with blank documents or vague notes

**Intervention:**
- Pull student aside during Activity 1
- "You don't have drafts. This puts you at serious risk. Here's what to do:"
  - Use tutorial time to draft ONE section (focus on goals—highest weight)
  - Schedule office hours TODAY or TOMORROW for help on other sections
  - Be realistic: "You might not achieve A-grade at this point, but you can still pass if you work intensely Tuesday-Thursday"
  - Consider: Suggest student use one late day if available (check university policy)

**Follow-Up:**
- Email student after tutorial with action plan
- Check in Thursday to confirm progress

---

**Issue 2: Student's Goals Are All Vague Despite Activity 1**

**Symptoms:** After 25 minutes, all 6 goals still fail SMART criteria

**Intervention:**
- Work one-on-one during Activity 2
- Take ONE goal and transform it together using lecture examples
- Script: "Let's make this specific. Your goal is 'Improve leadership.' What does improvement look like? How would you measure it? By when?"
- Walk through: "Improve leadership" → "Lead 3 student organization projects with teams of 5+ members by May 2026, achieving average team satisfaction score of 4.0/5.0"
- "Now YOU try the same process with your other 5 goals. Come to office hours if stuck."

**Why Not Fix All 6 Goals for Them:**
- They need to learn this skill (application of frameworks)
- Fixing one teaches them the process
- They're capable—just need guided practice

---

**Issue 3: Student Hasn't Completed Mentorship Meetings**

**Symptoms:** Only 2-3 meetings completed, or no mentor validation

**Intervention:**
- "How many mentorship meetings have you completed?" [Requirement is 4]
- If <4 meetings: "This is a problem. Mentorship is 20% of course grade AND Part 4 of PDP requires evidence from all 4 meetings."
- **If 3 meetings:** "Can you do Meeting #4 TODAY or TOMORROW? Email mentor NOW to schedule emergency meeting."
- **If <3 meetings:** "You'll lose significant points on mentorship assessment. For PDP, document the meetings you DID have—include as much mentor feedback as possible. Explain in note to instructor why 4 meetings not completed."

**Note:** This should have been caught earlier in semester, but sometimes surfaces in Week 11

---

**Issue 4: Student's PDP Parts Are Disconnected (No Integration)**

**Symptoms:** SWOT doesn't reference assessments, goals don't align with SWOT, mentor feedback isolated

**Intervention:**
- Use Integration Mapping activity to diagnose
- Work through ONE connection together:
  - "Your VIA strength is Creativity. Does that appear in your SWOT Strengths section?" [Often no]
  - "Add it: 'Creative problem-solving (VIA Creativity strength, demonstrated through design thinking projects)'"
  - "Now look at your goals. Which goal leverages your Creativity?" [Often none]
  - "Your Goal 3 is about marketing campaigns—that uses creativity! Add connection: 'This goal leverages my VIA Creativity strength identified in Part 1.'"
- "Now YOU do this for your other strengths and goals. Every goal should connect to SWOT."

**Why This Matters:**
- Integration is what distinguishes A from C grade PDPs
- Rubric specifically assesses coherence

---

**Issue 5: Student Overwhelmed / Anxious About Deadline**

**Symptoms:** Visibly stressed, says "I can't finish this," near tears

**Intervention:**
- Normalize: "Many students feel this way in Week 11. You're not alone."
- Reality check: "Let's look at what you HAVE done." [Review their materials]
- Often they're 70% done but FEEL 10% done
- Prioritize: "You don't need perfection. You need completion. Focus on these 3 things: (1) Make goals SMART, (2) Get mentor validation, (3) Proofread."
- Action plan: "What can you finish tonight? Tomorrow? Thursday?"
- Offer office hours: "Come see me [day/time] and we'll work through one section together."
- Reassure: "You CAN do this. It's 3 days until deadline—that's enough time if you work focused."

**When to Escalate:**
- If student mentions mental health crisis, refer to university counseling services
- If student has extenuating circumstances (family emergency, medical issue), connect with instructor for possible extension

## Grading Preparation (If Tutor Assists with Grading)

**If you're helping grade PDPs, prepare:**

**Rubric Familiarization:**
- Review Assessment Handbook PDP Rubric (pp. 680-686) in detail
- Understand weighting: Part 3 (30%), Part 4 (20%), Part 1 (20%), Part 2 (15%), Part 5 (10%), Part 6 (5%)
- Calibrate with instructor on 2-3 sample PDPs before grading full batch

**Common Grading Issues:**

**Issue: Goals Labeled SMART But Aren't**
- Students write "SMART Goal 1" but goal fails measurable or time-bound criteria
- Grade Part 3 based on actual quality, not label
- Deduct points if goals aren't truly SMART

**Issue: Mentor Validation Vague or Missing**
- Requirement: 50-100 words confirming mentor reviewed plan and supports direction
- Students submit: "Good job. -Mentor Name" (5 words, doesn't confirm review)
- Deduct Part 4 points for inadequate validation

**Issue: Word Count Violations**
- Part 6 reflection must be 200 words (±5 acceptable)
- Vision must be 50 words maximum
- If significantly over/under, deduct presentation points

**Issue: No Integration Despite Strong Individual Sections**
- All 6 parts present and adequate individually
- But no connections between parts (feels like 6 separate documents)
- Grade down for lack of coherence (this is rubric criterion)

**Grading Efficiency:**
- Use rubric checklist for each part (fast scoring)
- Note 1-2 specific strengths and 1-2 weaknesses per PDP (feedback)
- Budget 15-20 min per PDP for thorough review
- If grading 30 PDPs, that's 7.5-10 hours total
