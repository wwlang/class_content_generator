# Week 11: Designing Your Development Plan - Tutorial Tutor Notes

## Session Overview

**Format:** Individual PDP work session with instructor circulation and one-on-one support
**Total Duration:** 90 minutes
**Context:** PDP (40% of final grade) is due Friday, November 28 at 11:59 PM. This tutorial provides dedicated time for students to make substantial progress.

---

## Timing Table

| Time | Activity | Focus | Instructor Role |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Quick Review & Setup | Ensure students have all materials; clarify task | Direct instruction, logistics check |
| 0:05-0:80 | Individual Work Time | Students work on PDP completion (80% goal) | Active circulation, one-on-one support |
| 0:35-0:40 | Mid-Session Check | Brief progress assessment and common issues | 2-minute class-wide redirection |
| 0:80-0:90 | Before Next Class | Completion timeline, deadline reminders, Q&A | Direct instruction, final guidance |

**Critical Success Factor:** The 75-minute work block is the heart of this tutorial. Your effectiveness depends on continuous, strategic circulation providing targeted support to each student.

## Valid Approaches to the Tutorial

This tutorial is **directive, not exploratory**. Students are not discovering their approach—they are executing a structured plan. Three valid instructor approaches:

### Approach 1: Triage Circulation (Recommended)

Continuously circulate, prioritizing students by need level:
- **Red flags first** (students stuck, distracted, or lacking materials) → Immediate intervention
- **Yellow flags second** (students making slow progress or producing vague content) → Diagnostic questions and direction
- **Green flags third** (students progressing well) → Quick quality check and encouragement

**Rationale:** Maximize impact by helping struggling students first while allowing high-performers to work independently.

---

### Approach 2: Sequential Check-Ins

Visit every student in order, spending 3-5 minutes with each, ensuring everyone receives at least one substantial interaction.

**Rationale:** Ensures equity—every student gets face time and feedback regardless of need level.

---

### Approach 3: Section-Based Support

Announce focus sections at intervals (e.g., "I'm now supporting students working on SMART goals; raise hand if you need help with goal-setting") and provide targeted support to students working on that component.

**Rationale:** Allows for deeper, more focused feedback on specific PDP components, helpful if many students struggle with the same section.

---

## Invalid Approaches (What Not to Do)

❌ **Passive monitoring:** Sitting at desk waiting for students to approach you. Students won't interrupt their work to ask questions—you must actively circulate.

❌ **Generic encouragement:** Walking by saying "looks good, keep going" without actually reading their work. Students need substantive feedback.

❌ **Extended single-student focus:** Spending 20+ minutes helping one student while neglecting others. Set time limits for interventions.

❌ **Group mini-lectures:** Stopping the class repeatedly to re-teach concepts from the lecture. Handle questions individually or save for one mid-session check-in.

❌ **Doing the work for students:** Writing their goals, vision statements, or SWOT items. Guide their thinking, don't produce their content.

## Facilitation Guidance

### Opening 5 Minutes: Setting Expectations

**Objective:** Ensure every student understands the task, has necessary materials, and knows how to get help.

**Script Framework:**
1. Acknowledge context: "This is your PDP finalization session—40% of your grade, due Friday."
2. Clarify structure: "75 minutes of focused work time. I circulate to help. Raise hand if stuck."
3. Materials check: "Do you have all 5 assessment results, mentor notes, laptop?"
4. Set expectations: "This is NOT group work. Individual focus. Phones away."
5. Answer logistics questions only (not content questions—handle those during circulation).

**Red Flag:** If >30% of students lack key materials (assessment results, mentor notes), consider pausing for 10-15 minutes to let them complete/access materials online. Adjust work time accordingly.

---

### Minutes 5-80: Active Circulation

**Primary Facilitation Mode:** One-on-one diagnostic conversations

**Circulation Pattern:**
- Move continuously (don't sit down except briefly when helping a student)
- Approach students systematically—don't cluster in one area
- Visit every student at least once in first 30 minutes
- Return to struggling students multiple times

**Diagnostic Question Framework:**

When approaching a student, quickly assess their status:

**If writing steadily:** "How's it going? Show me what section you're working on."
- Quick scan of their work
- Provide one piece of specific feedback ("This SWOT Strengths section is solid—add one more item with specific evidence")
- Move on (don't interrupt flow)

**If stuck/staring:** "Where are you stuck? What section are you trying to complete?"
- Identify the barrier (lack of ideas, unclear requirements, perfectionism)
- Provide directive next step ("In next 10 minutes, draft 5 items for your Weaknesses quadrant based on your EI assessment feedback. I'll check back.")
- Set mini-deadline and return

**If distracted:** "Let's refocus. Put phone away. What's your next task?"
- Brief, firm redirection
- State specific expectation ("I expect you to have your Vision Statement drafted when I come back in 15 minutes")
- Monitor more closely on subsequent passes

### Common Student Challenges and Interventions

**Challenge 1: "I don't know what to write for my vision statement."**

**Intervention:**
Ask: "What do you care about most? What kind of work would feel meaningful?" [Listen]
"What are your top 2 VIA strengths?" [Listen]
"Okay, let's try: 'I envision a career in [field] where I use [strengths] to [impact], guided by [value].' Now fill in those blanks based on what you just told me."

**Rationale:** Vision paralysis comes from thinking it must be perfect. Provide a template to break analysis paralysis.

---

**Challenge 2: "My goals aren't SMART—they're too vague."**

**Intervention:**
"Show me your vaguest goal." [Read it]
"Let's make this SMART. What SPECIFICALLY will you do? When EXACTLY will you complete it? How will you MEASURE success?"
Work through one goal together as model, then: "Now apply this process to your other 5 goals."

**Rationale:** Students understand SMART in theory but struggle in application. Model the revision process once; they can replicate it.

---

**Challenge 3: "I haven't finished my self-assessments."**

**Intervention:**
"Which assessments are missing?" [Student lists]
"You cannot complete your PDP without all 5 assessments—it's 20% of the rubric. Here's what to do: complete [missing assessment] right now online. It takes [X] minutes. Once you have results, come back to your integration statement. I'll check your progress in [X+5] minutes."

**Rationale:** Non-negotiable requirement. Better to complete assessment now than submit incomplete PDP.

---

**Challenge 4: "I'm not sure if this is good enough."**

**Intervention:**
"Let's check against the rubric. Show me your Self-Assessment Integration section." [Read]
"This meets the requirement—you've summarized all 5 and identified patterns. Now show me your SWOT." [Read]
"Your Strengths and Opportunities are strong. Your Weaknesses needs 2 more items—be more honest about growth areas. Your Threats should be external challenges, not internal—these are internal. Let's revise."

**Rationale:** "Good enough" is vague. Specific rubric-based feedback shows exactly what needs improvement.

---

**Challenge 5: "My mentor hasn't responded about validation statement."**

**Intervention:**
"When did you last contact them?" [Student responds]
"Okay, send them an email TODAY with your draft PDP attached and this message: 'I need a brief validation statement for my PDP due Friday. Could you confirm this plan reflects our meetings and provide 50-100 words supporting my direction?' Copy me on the email. If they don't respond by Thursday, email me and we'll create a contingency plan."

**Rationale:** Students often wait passively. Direct action with deadline pressure usually gets results.

---

### Mid-Session Check (Around 35-40 minutes)

**Objective:** Course-correct common issues without extensive interruption.

**When to Intervene:**
- 40%+ of students are stuck on the same component
- Observable pattern of misunderstanding (e.g., everyone's goals lack time-bounds)
- Need to manage time expectations

**Format:**
- "Quick 2-minute checkpoint—look up."
- State observed pattern: "Many of you have goals that aren't time-bound. Every goal needs a deadline."
- Provide one clear directive: "Check every goal right now—does it have a specific deadline? If not, add one."
- Resume circulation: "Back to work. 35 minutes remaining."

**Don't:** Launch into 10-minute re-lecture. Keep it brief and tactical.

---

### Minutes 80-90: Closing Guidance

**Objective:** Ensure students know exactly what to do between now and Friday deadline.

**Key Points to Cover:**
1. **Tonight/Tomorrow tasks:** Complete draft, revise goals for SMART criteria
2. **Wednesday tasks:** Share with mentor, request validation, self-review against checklist
3. **Thursday tasks:** Final edits, proofread, prepare for submission
4. **Friday tasks:** Submit via Google Form by 11:59 PM

**Logistics Clarity:**
- Google Form link location (course management system)
- Late penalty (10% per day)
- Submission format (Word doc, then copy/paste into form)

**Motivational Framing:**
"This PDP is not just an assignment—it's a tool you'll use for five years. NEU alumni consistently tell me this was their most valuable university project. Invest the time this week."

**Q&A:** Answer deadline, technical, and logistics questions. Defer content questions to email/office hours.

## Cultural Sensitivity and Vietnamese Context

### Context-Specific Considerations

**1. Family Expectations vs. Personal Vision**

Many Vietnamese students face tension between family career expectations (often medicine, engineering, government, banking) and personal interests.

**Facilitation Approach:**
- Acknowledge this tension explicitly if students raise it: "I know some of you feel pressure to choose careers your family prefers. Your PDP can include both—how will you honor your family's hopes while pursuing what matters to you?"
- Encourage students to discuss PDP with family as accountability partners: "Your family's support matters—share your plan with them."
- Avoid dismissing family input as "old-fashioned" or "limiting." Frame as integration, not rebellion.

---

**2. Modesty and Self-Promotion**

Vietnamese cultural values emphasize humility. Students may struggle to articulate strengths or write ambitious goals, fearing they'll appear arrogant.

**Facilitation Approach:**
- Reframe self-awareness as professional skill: "In international business contexts, you must articulate your strengths clearly. This isn't boasting—it's career communication."
- Provide examples of professional self-description: "I leverage strategic thinking and data analysis skills to improve marketing ROI" (professional) vs. "I'm amazing at marketing" (arrogant).
- If students' SWOT Strengths quadrant is notably weaker than Weaknesses: "I notice you have 7 weaknesses and 3 strengths. That imbalance suggests you're being too modest. Your assessment results show clear strengths—include them."

---

**3. English Language Anxiety**

Some students worry their English isn't "good enough" for professional vision statements or goals.

**Facilitation Approach:**
- Prioritize content over polish: "First, get your ideas down in any words. We can refine language later. Right now, clarity matters more than perfect grammar."
- Offer simple templates: "Use this structure: 'I will [action] by [date] to [outcome].' Fill in the blanks first, then elaborate."
- Encourage Grammarly use: "Grammarly can help with grammar and clarity—it's professional writing support, not cheating."

---

**4. Collectivist vs. Individualist Goal-Setting**

Vietnamese culture emphasizes collective success (family, community) over individual achievement. Western goal-setting frameworks are often individualistic.

**Facilitation Approach:**
- Integrate collectivist values into goals: "Your goals can include impact on others. 'Develop skills to support my family financially' or 'Build social enterprise benefiting Vietnamese SMEs' are valid, meaningful goals."
- Connect personal development to broader contribution: "As you grow your capabilities, how will you use them to benefit your community, industry, or country? That can be part of your vision."

---

**5. Risk Aversion and "Safe" Career Paths**

Students may default to conservative career goals (multinational company job, government position) even when assessments suggest entrepreneurial or creative paths.

**Facilitation Approach:**
- Validate both security and exploration: "It's smart to value stability—especially in Vietnam's economic context. But your assessments show entrepreneurial strengths. Can your 1-year goals build employable skills while your 5-year goals leave room for entrepreneurship if an opportunity emerges?"
- Present risk management, not risk-taking: "You don't have to choose 'safe' OR 'risky.' You can build a career path that develops versatile skills applicable to both corporate and entrepreneurial contexts."

## Common Mistakes and How to Address Them

### Mistake 1: Copying Goals from Generic Templates

**Symptom:** Multiple students have nearly identical goals ("Improve communication skills," "Gain international experience," "Develop leadership").

**Intervention:**
"This goal is generic—it could apply to anyone. Your PDP should reflect YOUR specific situation. Based on your assessments, what communication skills specifically? Public speaking? Written persuasion? Cross-cultural communication? Pick one, make it specific, and tie it to your career direction."

---

### Mistake 2: Goals Without Action Steps

**Symptom:** Student lists 6 goals but no action steps, resources, or obstacle planning.

**Intervention:**
"Your goals are clear, but each needs 3-5 action steps. Let's take Goal 1. What are the specific actions you'll take to achieve this? When will you do each action? What resources do you need? Write those now for all 6 goals."

---

### Mistake 3: SWOT with No Strategic Connections

**Symptom:** SWOT is complete but Part 2 (Vision & Goals) shows no connection to SWOT insights.

**Intervention:**
"Your SWOT shows 'lack of data skills' as a weakness and 'growing analytics job market' as an opportunity. But none of your goals address this. That's a missed strategic connection. Should one of your short-term goals be developing data skills? Show me how your goals address the gaps your SWOT identified."

---

### Mistake 4: Mentor Integration is Vague

**Symptom:** Part 4 says "My mentor gave good advice" without specifics.

**Intervention:**
"This is too vague. The rubric requires evidence from all 4 meetings with specific examples. What advice did your mentor give in Meeting 1? Meeting 2? Write: 'Meeting 1: Mentor suggested I focus on digital marketing certifications rather than traditional marketing roles, which influenced Goal 2.' Show concrete influence."

---

### Mistake 5: Unrealistic Timeline Density

**Symptom:** Student plans to complete 5 certificates, 2 internships, and start a business all in Year 1 while maintaining 3.8 GPA.

**Intervention:**
"Let's check feasibility. You're taking 6 courses per semester, working part-time, and you've listed 5 major goals for Year 1. Let's calculate hours: each certificate takes ~40 hours, that's 200 hours total. Each internship is ~400 hours. Business startup is 300+ hours. That's 1,300+ hours, or 25 hours/week for a year—on top of coursework and work. This isn't realistic. Which 2-3 goals are most critical for Year 1? Move the others to Year 2-3."

## Troubleshooting Edge Cases

**Scenario 1: Student completed only 3/5 self-assessments and claims others are "not available online."**

**Response:** "All 5 assessments are available. VIA Character Strengths: viacharacter.org. 16 Personalities: 16personalities.com. CliftonStrengths: you received access code in course materials—check your email from Week 5. EI assessment: link in Week 7 materials. Holland Code: link in Week 5 materials. If you genuinely cannot access one, email me immediately with screenshot of the error and I'll provide alternative assessment."

---

**Scenario 2: Student says "My mentor has disappeared and won't respond."**

**Response:** "When did you last contact them? [Student responds] Okay, email them TODAY with urgent request. Copy me. If no response by Thursday 5 PM, email me and I'll contact mentorship coordinators to intervene or provide alternative validation approach. But you must try to reach them first—that's your responsibility."

---

**Scenario 3: Student's PDP reveals concerning mental health or personal crisis.**

**Response:** Handle with sensitivity. After tutorial, speak privately: "I noticed [specific concern] in your PDP. Are you okay? Are you getting support?" Provide university counseling resources. If needed, flag for student services while respecting privacy.

---

**Scenario 4: Student's goals reflect entirely family-imposed career path with no personal alignment.**

**Response:** "Your PDP should reflect YOUR vision. I see goals here, but I don't see your voice. Your self-assessments show [X strengths/interests], but your goals focus on [Y unrelated field]. Is this what YOU want, or what you feel you should want? This is a confidential document—be honest about your aspirations, even if they differ from family expectations. If you need support navigating family career conversations, I can provide guidance."

---

**Final Note to Tutors**

This tutorial's success depends on your active, strategic circulation. The 75-minute work block is not "free time"—it's intensive one-on-one coaching at scale. Move continuously. Read students' work critically. Provide specific, actionable feedback. Identify struggling students early and intervene decisively. Your goal: every student leaves with 80%+ of PDP complete and clear action plan for finishing by Friday.

Your facilitation directly impacts whether students produce generic, checkbox assignments or authentic, strategic development plans that actually guide their careers. Make every interaction count.
