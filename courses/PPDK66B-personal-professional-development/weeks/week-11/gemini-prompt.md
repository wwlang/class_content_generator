# 90%

**of people who set New Year's resolutions fail by February**

**But structured goal-setting increases achievement probability by 42%**

*(Locke & Latham, 2002; Dominican University Study)*

<speaker-notes>
The problem isn't goal-setting itself—it's HOW we set goals. Vague intentions like "I'll work harder" fail, while specific, difficult goals with accountability succeed. Your PDP isn't a New Year's resolution—it's a strategic career plan based on 35 years of psychological research. Today you'll learn the science behind effective goals, then apply it in tutorial to finalize your plan before Friday's submission deadline.

# Designing Your Personal Development Plan
## From Self-Knowledge to Strategic Action

**Week 11 of 12**

<speaker-notes>
This is the CULMINATION of 11 weeks of work. Weeks 1-2 covered the AI-era landscape, Weeks 3-4 built your learning capacity, Week 5 provided self-knowledge through assessments, Weeks 6-10 developed skills and provided experiences, and today we give you the final frameworks for strategic planning. Your PDP is 40% of your course grade—the largest single assessment. Tutorial today is your FINAL workshop before Friday's submission.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Locke & Latham's goal-setting theory mechanisms
2. **Create** SMART goals (not just label goals as SMART)
3. **Use** OKR framework for 1-3-5 year roadmaps
4. **Conduct** personal SWOT analysis
5. **Design** accountability mechanisms
6. **Integrate** all course learning into coherent PDP

<speaker-notes>
These are the final tools you need to complete PDP Part 3 (Vision & Goals) worth 30% of your PDP grade, and Part 2 (SWOT & Skills Gap) worth 15%. Combined, that's 45% of your largest assessment. This isn't theoretical—you'll USE these frameworks in tutorial within 90 minutes to finalize your submission.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" layout="section-break" title="Part 1: The Science">

# Part 1: The Science of Goal-Setting
## Locke and Latham's Theory

<speaker-notes>
Edwin Locke and Gary Latham spent 35 years studying goal-setting. Their 2002 American Psychologist article has 7,243+ citations—one of psychology's most influential papers. You need to understand WHY goals work to set them effectively. Random goal-setting produces low success rates, while theory-informed goal-setting increases achievement by 42%.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="5" layout="framework" title="Core Finding">

## The Goal-Performance Relationship

**Key Finding:** Specific, difficult goals consistently lead to higher performance than "do your best" goals.

**Effect Sizes Across 400+ Studies:**
- Goal specificity effect: d = 0.42 to 0.82 (medium to large)
- Goal difficulty effect: d = 0.52 to 0.82 (medium to large)
- Combined effect: Goals improve performance by 12-15% on average

**What This Means:**
- "Do your best" = baseline performance
- "Achieve 85% on final exam" = significantly higher effort and performance
- "Reach IELTS 7.5 by June 2026" > "Improve my English"

**Why It Works:** Specific, difficult goals trigger four psychological mechanisms.

*Locke & Latham (2002) — American Psychologist*

<speaker-notes>
This is THE foundational finding. Goals must be specific AND difficult. Vague goals like "try hard" don't work. Effect sizes of d = 0.5+ mean HALF a standard deviation improvement—substantial impact. Example: "Deliver 5 presentations to 20+ people by December 2026, receiving average feedback score of 4.0/5.0 on clarity and engagement" is specific and difficult, triggering the four mechanisms we'll cover next.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="content" title="Four Goal Mechanisms">

## How Goals Improve Performance

**Mechanism 1: Direction**
- Goals direct attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities
- Example: "IELTS 7.5" goal → focus on vocabulary, writing practice (not random English exposure)

**Mechanism 2: Effort**
- Higher goals mobilize greater effort
- Example: GPA 3.8 goal → study 25 hrs/week vs. GPA 3.0 goal → study 15 hrs/week

**Mechanism 3: Persistence**
- Goals increase persistence over time
- Example: "Run 5K by April" → continue training despite setbacks

**Mechanism 4: Strategy Development**
- Challenging goals prompt task-specific strategies and planning
- Example: "Publish research paper" → learn methodology, find advisor, develop writing routine

*When all four mechanisms activate simultaneously, goal attainment probability increases dramatically.*

<speaker-notes>
Understanding these mechanisms helps you leverage goals better. Direction filters what you focus on; Effort mobilizes energy proportional to difficulty; Persistence sustains you through plateaus; Strategy forces systematic planning for complex goals. When you write SMART goals in your PDP, ask: Does this goal activate all four mechanisms? If not, revise to make it more specific or challenging. Tutorial Activity 1 today reviews your goals through this lens.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="content" title="Goal Moderators">

## When Goals Work Best — Four Critical Moderators

**1. Feedback**
- Progress feedback is essential for goal adjustment
- Without feedback, you don't know if strategies are working
- Example: Weekly GPA tracking, monthly skills self-assessment

**2. Goal Commitment**
- You must be committed to the goal (not externally imposed)
- Commitment highest when: (a) goal is self-set, (b) goal is public, (c) you understand goal importance
- PDP goals must be YOUR goals, not what you think instructors want

**3. Task Complexity**
- Simple tasks: Specific goals work immediately
- Complex tasks: Need learning period + strategy development first
- Example: "Master financial modeling" requires breaking into sub-goals

**4. Adequate Ability**
- Goals must match your current ability level + reasonable stretch
- Impossible goals → anxiety and disengagement
- Example: "Become CEO in 1 year" (impossible) vs. "Reach team leader role in 3 years" (stretch)

*Goals are most effective when ALL four moderators are present.*

<speaker-notes>
Goals don't work in a vacuum—context matters. Feedback must be timely and specific (not annual review only). Commitment is critical—low commitment means goals are just words on paper. For complex goals, break into sub-goals with learning milestones. Goals must be in the Goldilocks zone—not too easy, not impossible. Your PDP should address: Part 5 Implementation covers feedback/accountability mechanisms; Part 3 ensures goals are self-set and meaningful; Part 3 Action Steps break complex goals into sub-goals.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="section-break" title="Part 2: SMART Framework">

# Part 2: SMART Goals Framework
## Making Goals Actionable

<speaker-notes>
SMART goals operationalize Locke & Latham's theory. It's the most popular framework in business, education, and coaching. But reality check: Most people LABEL goals as SMART without actually making them SMART. Today you'll learn to create genuinely SMART goals that will pass the rigorous evaluation in your PDP rubric.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="SMART Criteria">

## SMART Criteria

**S — Specific**
- Clearly defined, unambiguous target
- Answers: What? Why? Who? Where? Which?

**M — Measurable**
- Quantifiable progress indicators
- Answers: How much? How many? How will I know when it's accomplished?

**A — Achievable**
- Realistic given resources, time, ability
- Stretch goal but not impossible

**R — Relevant**
- Aligns with broader objectives, values, career vision
- Matters to YOU and your development

**T — Time-bound**
- Clear deadline or timeframe
- Creates urgency and allows planning

*All five criteria must be present for a goal to be truly SMART.*

<speaker-notes>
Each letter addresses a common goal-setting mistake. S fixes vague goals ("be better"), M fixes unmeasurable goals ("improve communication"), A fixes impossible goals ("become CEO in 1 year"), R fixes misaligned goals (pursuing parent's dream, not yours), T fixes open-ended goals ("someday I'll..."). Research from Martins van Jaarsveld et al. (2025) shows SMART goal interventions are effective when embedded in course activities over multiple sessions. Your PDP requires minimum 6 SMART goals (3 short-term, 2 medium-term, 1 long-term), and each will be evaluated against all five criteria.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="SMART Examples">

## Transforming Vague Goals into SMART Goals

| Vague Goal (NOT SMART) | SMART Goal (All 5 Criteria) |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| "Improve my leadership skills" | "Lead 3 student organization projects with teams of 5+ members by May 2026, achieving average team satisfaction score of 4.0/5.0 on post-project surveys" |
| "Learn data analytics" | "Complete Google Data Analytics Certificate (6 courses, 180 hours) and apply skills in 2 real-world projects by December 2026, achieving certificate with 90%+ average" |
| "Network more" | "Attend 8 industry networking events and conduct 12 informational interviews with professionals in consulting field by June 2026, documenting insights in LinkedIn posts" |
| "Be healthier" | "Exercise 4x per week (minimum 30 min cardio or strength training) for 6 consecutive months by August 2026, tracked via fitness app with 90%+ adherence rate" |
| "Get a good job" | "Secure summer internship at Big 4 consulting firm or equivalent by March 2026 through targeted applications (minimum 15 firms) and 20+ networking conversations" |

<speaker-notes>
Notice SMART goals are LONG—that's okay, better detailed than vague. Work through each example identifying which SMART criteria were missing in the vague version. For "Improve leadership": not specific (what aspect?), not measurable (how would you know?), no timeline. The SMART version specifies: 3 projects, 5+ team members, 4.0/5.0 satisfaction, by May 2026. Common mistake: Writing "Achieve IELTS 7.5" and calling it SMART. Missing: When? How? Better: "Achieve IELTS 7.5 by June 2026 through weekly tutoring (40 sessions) and daily 30-min practice (180 days tracked), with monthly practice tests to monitor progress." Tutorial Activity 2: Transform your vague PDP goals into truly SMART goals using this table as template.

<slide number="11" layout="section-break" title="Part 3: OKRs">

# Part 3: OKR Framework
## Structuring Multi-Year Roadmaps

<speaker-notes>
OKR = Objectives and Key Results, popularized by Google, Intel, LinkedIn through John Doerr's book "Measure What Matters." Originally for organizations, we're adapting it for personal development. SMART goals work best for short-term (1 year), but OKRs structure longer-term vision (3-5 years) while maintaining measurability.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="framework" title="OKR Structure">

## Objectives and Key Results

**Objective (O):**
- Qualitative, aspirational goal
- Describes WHAT you want to achieve
- Inspiring and directional
- Example: "Become a recognized expert in sustainable business strategy"

**Key Results (KRs):**
- Quantitative, measurable outcomes
- Describe HOW you'll know you achieved the objective
- Typically 2-5 key results per objective
- Example KRs for above objective:
  1. Publish 3 articles on sustainability in business journals
  2. Speak at 2 industry conferences on sustainable strategy
  3. Advise 5 companies on sustainability initiatives

**OKR Characteristics:**
- Ambitious (60-70% achievement is success, not failure)
- Time-bound (quarterly or yearly cycles)
- Transparent (shared publicly for accountability)

*Al-Saadi et al. (2023) — Omani higher education OKR implementation study*

<speaker-notes>
OKR separates "aspiration" (Objective) from "measurement" (Key Results), allowing ambitious vision plus concrete progress tracking. The Objective is qualitative—"recognized expert"—while Key Results are quantifiable: count publications, talks, clients. Google's philosophy: If you achieve 100% of Key Results, your objective wasn't ambitious enough. Target 60-70% achievement to encourage stretch thinking. For personal development: 1-Year OKRs are tactical (build skills, complete projects), 3-Year OKRs are strategic (establish expertise, career progression), 5-Year OKRs are visionary (industry recognition, major achievements).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="OKR Examples">

## Personal Development OKR Examples

**1-Year Horizon (2026):**
- **Objective:** Establish strong foundation in business analytics and consulting skills
- **Key Results:**
  - Complete 2 data analytics certifications (Google Analytics, Tableau)
  - Lead 3 case competition teams with 1 top-3 finish
  - Secure summer 2026 internship at consulting firm or analytics team

**3-Year Horizon (2028):**
- **Objective:** Build expertise in strategy consulting with data-driven approach
- **Key Results:**
  - Promoted to senior analyst or consultant role
  - Deliver 10+ client projects with measurable business impact (documented)
  - Develop specialized expertise in 1-2 industries (e.g., fintech, retail)

**5-Year Horizon (2030):**
- **Objective:** Recognized as strategic advisor combining analytics and business acumen
- **Key Results:**
  - Manage team of 3-5 junior consultants
  - Publish 2 thought leadership pieces (industry blog, journal, conference)
  - Lead $500K+ consulting engagements independently

<speaker-notes>
Notice progressive ambition across time horizons. 1-year is tactical (foundation: skills, credentials), 3-year is application (expertise, specialization, promotion), 5-year is recognition (leadership, thought leadership, impact). Your PDP Part 3 requires goals for all three time horizons: use SMART format for 1-year goals (very specific), use OKR format for 3-year and 5-year goals (objective + 2-3 key results). Common mistakes: Too vague at 5 years ("Be successful in business"—no key results), too tactical at 5 years ("Complete Excel course"—that's 1-year level), no progression (all three periods look the same). Your Holland Code informs career field, VIA strengths inform how you'll contribute, CliftonStrengths inform development path.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="section-break" title="Part 4: SWOT Analysis">

# Part 4: SWOT Analysis
## Understanding Your Strategic Position

<speaker-notes>
SWOT is a strategic planning tool from business that we adapt for personal development. It helps you understand context BEFORE setting goals. Goals without context equal wishful thinking. SWOT grounds goals in reality (strengths, weaknesses) and opportunity (external factors).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="Personal SWOT Framework">

## Four Quadrants for Personal Development

**Strengths (Internal, Positive)**
- Natural talents, developed skills, character strengths
- Based on self-assessments: VIA strengths, CliftonStrengths themes, MBTI preferences, technical skills
- Example: "Strong analytical thinking (VIA Judgment + CliftonStrengths Analytical), fluent English, financial modeling skills"

**Weaknesses (Internal, Negative)**
- Skill gaps, limiting beliefs, underdeveloped competencies
- Based on skills gap analysis, EI assessment, mentor feedback
- Example: "Weak public speaking confidence, limited networking experience, fixed mindset tendencies"

**Opportunities (External, Positive)**
- Market trends, industry growth, available resources, networks
- Based on Vietnam labor market, AI-era trends (Week 1-2), emerging industries
- Example: "Vietnam digital economy growing 25% annually, demand for data analysts, NEU alumni network in consulting"

**Threats (External, Negative)**
- Market challenges, competition, technological disruption, barriers
- Based on labor market analysis, AI displacement risks
- Example: "High competition for consulting roles, AI automating basic analytics, English proficiency gaps vs. international candidates"

<speaker-notes>
Internal (S/W) = things YOU control; External (O/T) = environmental factors you respond to. Don't be modest on Strengths—list everything from 5 assessments plus mentor feedback. Be honest on Weaknesses—these become development priorities. Opportunities must be research-based (what's actually growing in Vietnam/ASEAN?), not wishful thinking. Threats should be realistic about competition and disruption. Use SWOT for goals: Leverage Strengths (goals that use your natural abilities), Address Weaknesses (goals that develop gaps), Capture Opportunities (goals aligned with growth areas), Mitigate Threats (goals that differentiate you). PDP Part 2 requires SWOT with 5-7 items per quadrant, integrating self-assessment insights with market realities.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="section-break" title="Part 5: Accountability">

# Part 5: Accountability Mechanisms
## Ensuring Goal Achievement

<speaker-notes>
Research shows publicly committing to goals increases achievement by 65%. Adding an accountability partner increases it by another 25%. The problem with private goals: easy to abandon when motivation fades, no consequences for not following through. Solution: Build accountability into goal design from the start.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Five Accountability Strategies">

## How to Maintain Progress

**1. Progress Tracking Systems**
- Weekly/monthly reviews of goal progress
- Tools: Notion, spreadsheet, journal, habit tracker app
- Example: Monthly PDP review meeting with yourself (calendar block)

**2. Public Commitment**
- Share goals with mentor, friends, family
- Social pressure to follow through
- Example: Post 3-year vision on LinkedIn

**3. Accountability Partners**
- Regular check-ins with peer or mentor
- Mutual goal-sharing and progress updates
- Example: Monthly coffee with classmate to review PDP progress

**4. Scheduled Milestones**
- Break goals into monthly/quarterly checkpoints
- Celebrate small wins
- Example: If goal is "Complete Google Analytics cert by Dec 2026," milestones = complete 1 course every 6 weeks

**5. Consequence Design**
- Positive: Reward yourself for achieving milestones
- Negative: Public commitment means embarrassment if you quit
- Example: "If I complete 4 informational interviews this month, I buy myself favorite book"

*Accountability transforms intentions into action.*

<speaker-notes>
Accountability is what separates achievers from dreamers. Your PDP Part 5 requires documenting accountability mechanisms. Progress Tracking must be regular (weekly minimum for short-term goals). Public Commitment: vulnerability increases commitment. Accountability Partners: choose someone who will challenge you, not just cheer. Milestones: creates dopamine hits throughout long journey. Consequences: loss aversion is powerful motivator. Example complete system: Goal "Secure consulting internship by March 2026" with weekly application tracker, public LinkedIn share, weekly check-in with recruiting classmate, monthly milestones (Oct: 5 conversations, Nov: 10 applications, Dec: 2 interviews), consequence (if miss Oct milestone, attend 2 extra networking events in Nov). Common mistakes: No tracking system (goals forgotten), only private goals (easy to abandon), no milestones (overwhelming, procrastinate), no consequences (low stakes, low effort).

<slide number="18" layout="section-break" title="Part 6: Integration">

# Part 6: Integrating Your PDP
## Bringing It All Together

<speaker-notes>
You have all the pieces—now we assemble them. Your PDP is MORE than the sum of parts—it's a coherent narrative. Let me show you how a complete PDP flows, with each part strengthening the others. Assessors look for connections between parts.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="framework" title="PDP Integration">

## How the Six Parts Connect

**Part 1: Self-Knowledge Foundation (20%)**
- Self-assessments (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, Holland, EI) + Integration Statement
- **Feeds into:** Parts 2, 3, 4

**Part 2: SWOT & Skills Gap (15%)**
- Strengths based on assessments + Weaknesses = development priorities
- **Feeds into:** Part 3 (goals address weaknesses, leverage strengths)

**Part 3: Vision & Goals (30%)**
- Vision statement aligned with values/strengths + SMART/OKR goals
- **Informed by:** Parts 1 & 2; **Feeds into:** Parts 4 & 5

**Part 4: Mentor Integration (20%)**
- Evidence from 4 meetings + Mentor validation
- **Influences:** Parts 2 & 3 (mentor advice shaped SWOT and goals)

**Part 5: Implementation & Accountability (10%)**
- Timeline + Accountability mechanisms
- **Executes:** Part 3 (turns goals into actions)

**Part 6: Personal Reflection (5%)**
- Learning, growth, excitement
- **Synthesizes:** Entire course journey

*Each part strengthens the others—coherence is key.*

<speaker-notes>
Strong PDP: Clear golden thread from self-assessment to SWOT to goals to mentor feedback to implementation. Weak PDP: Parts feel disconnected, goals don't match strengths, mentor feedback not integrated. Example of integration: Part 1 shows VIA Judgment + CliftonStrengths Analytical + Holland I (Investigative); Part 2 SWOT Strength = "Strong analytical thinking", Opportunity = "Data analytics demand in Vietnam"; Part 3 Goal = "Complete Google Data Analytics cert + apply in 2 projects by Dec 2026" (leverages strength, captures opportunity); Part 4 Mentor advised "Specialize in business intelligence" (confirms direction); Part 5 Accountability = Monthly mentor progress review, public LinkedIn posts. Red flags: Goal unrelated to strengths/values, SWOT doesn't reference assessments, mentor feedback not visible in goals, implementation doesn't match goal difficulty.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="PDP Quality Criteria">

## What Excellent PDPs Demonstrate

**1. Authenticity**
- Goals reflect YOUR values, not what you think we want to hear
- Vision statement sounds like you, not a corporate mission statement

**2. Specificity**
- Goals are truly SMART (not just labeled SMART)
- Action steps detailed enough to execute tomorrow

**3. Integration**
- Self-assessments inform SWOT, SWOT informs goals, goals reflect mentor advice
- Clear connections across all six parts

**4. Evidence-Based**
- Goals grounded in market realities (opportunities/threats)
- Development strategies cite course frameworks (SMART, OKR, Locke & Latham mechanisms)

**5. Ambitious but Achievable**
- Goals stretch you (not comfortable)
- But realistic given your context (not fantasy)

**6. Actionable**
- Implementation plan so clear you could start Monday
- Accountability mechanisms specific (who, when, how)

<speaker-notes>
These distinguish A-grade PDPs from C-grade PDPs. The rubric assesses all six criteria. Authenticity: we can tell when goals are generic or copied. Specificity: "Improve leadership" fails, "Lead 3 projects with 4.0/5.0 satisfaction" succeeds. Integration: strongest indicator of deep thinking. Evidence-Based: cites Week 1 labor market research, Week 2 AI impact, mentor expertise. Ambitious but Achievable: Goldilocks zone. Actionable: test is "Could you execute tomorrow?" Example authenticity check: Inauthentic = "I want to become CEO of Fortune 500 company because leadership is important"; Authentic = "I want to build social enterprise addressing Vietnam rural education gaps because my VIA strength is Social Justice and my family struggled with education access." Final quality check: Print your PDP and read it as if you're your mentor. Ask: "Would I fund this person's development? Would I hire them based on this plan?" If no, revise.

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="Key Takeaways">

## Personal Development Planning Principles

1. **Goals must be specific and difficult** — Locke & Latham's 35 years of research proves vague goals fail

2. **SMART framework operationalizes goal-setting theory** — But most people label goals SMART without making them truly SMART

3. **OKRs structure long-term vision** — Separate aspiration (Objective) from measurement (Key Results) for 3-5 year goals

4. **SWOT grounds goals in reality** — Leverage strengths, address weaknesses, capture opportunities, mitigate threats

5. **Accountability determines achievement** — Public commitment + accountability partner + tracking = 65%+ higher success rate

6. **Integration creates coherence** — Your PDP tells ONE story: who you are → where you're going → how you'll get there

7. **Goals serve your vision** — Vision statement (50 words max) is North Star; goals are stepping stones

8. **Your PDP is a living document** — Review quarterly, revise annually, use throughout career

<speaker-notes>
These principles apply beyond this course—use them for life. Principles 1-2 are science of goal-setting (Locke & Latham to SMART), 3-4 are strategic frameworks (OKR, SWOT), 5 is implementation (accountability), 6-8 are meta-principles (coherence, vision-alignment, iteration). Most professionals NEVER do this depth of career planning. You're investing 12 weeks in your development—that's a competitive advantage. Research shows written goals are 42% more likely to be achieved. Your PDP is the map; next 5 years are the journey. Tutorial today is PDP assembly workshop—bring all components, we're building the final product, peer review will catch gaps before Friday submission.

These readings provide the theoretical foundation for your PDP frameworks. Locke & Latham (2002) is essential—the 35-year odyssey that validates specific, difficult goals. Martins van Jaarsveld et al. (2025) is a recent systematic review confirming SMART goals work in higher education when embedded in courses like this one. Al-Saadi et al. (2023) covers OKR implementation. All are accessible through library databases.

## Assessment Reminders

**URGENT — Personal Development Plan Due This Week:**

- Peer review before final submission
- This is your LAST workshop before deadline

**Mentor Validation Required:**
- Mentor must review your PDP and provide 50-100 word validation statement
- Confirms: They reviewed it, it reflects your meetings, they support your direction
- Missing validation = automatic deduction

**Final Oral Exam (Week 12, Exam Period):**
- 15-minute presentation of your PDP (10 min presentation + 5 min Q&A)
- Worth 30% of course grade
- Strong PDP makes presentation easier

<speaker-notes>
This is THE week—PDP due Friday for most sections. Tutorial is final quality check before submission. If you're not 80% done by end of tutorial today, you're at risk. Don't wait until Thursday night to assemble. Common last-minute issues: Mentor validation missing (reach out NOW if you haven't asked mentor), goals not truly SMART (use tutorial peer review to fix), no integration between parts (tutorial Activity 3 addresses this), word count wrong (Part 6 reflection must be EXACTLY 200 words). You've done the hard work—self-assessments, mentorship, SWOT, drafting. Today you ASSEMBLE and POLISH. This is the culmination of 11 weeks—make it count. Proofread before submission (spelling/grammar errors undermine professionalism). Use Assessment Handbook rubric as final checklist. Submit early (don't risk tech issues at 11:58 PM).

# Tutorial: PDP Assembly Workshop
## Final Quality Check Before Submission

<speaker-notes>
Tutorial structure: Activity 1 (30 min) = Review goals through Locke & Latham's four mechanisms lens, strengthen goals that don't activate all four. Activity 2 (30 min) = Transform vague goals into truly SMART goals using Slide 10 table as template, peer review for SMART criteria. Activity 3 (30 min) = Integration check—trace golden thread from self-assessments to SWOT to goals to mentor feedback to implementation, identify and fix disconnections. Bring your PDP draft, be ready to give and receive constructive feedback, this is your last opportunity to strengthen before Friday submission.

Tomorrow in tutorial you make them actionable through peer review and refinement. Friday you submit a comprehensive strategic plan that will guide your career for years. This is the culmination of 11 weeks of intensive self-discovery and development. You're ready.
