**Core Principle:** Specific, difficult goals lead to higher performance than vague or easy goals

**Research Base:**
- 35 years of empirical studies
- 7,243+ citations

---

### Slide 8 (Layout: framework)

**Title:** Four Mechanisms of Goal Performance

**Content:**
## How Goals Improve Performance

Locke & Latham identify **4 mechanisms** through which goals enhance achievement:

1. **Direction** → Goals direct attention toward goal-relevant activities (and away from distractions)

2. **Effort** → Higher goals mobilize greater effort

3. **Persistence** → Goals increase persistence over time

4. **Strategies** → Goals prompt development of task-relevant strategies and action plans

---

### Slide 9 (Layout: content)

**Title:** When Goals Work Best: Moderators

**Content:**
## When Do Goals Work Best?

Goals are most effective when these **moderators** are present:

**Adequate Feedback**
- You can measure progress toward goals
- You receive information about how you're performing

**High Goal Commitment**
- You're personally invested in the goal
- The goal aligns with your values

**Sufficient Ability**
- You have (or can develop) the skills needed
- Resources are available

**Appropriate Task Complexity**
- Task isn't so complex it overwhelms
- Or: complex tasks are broken into sub-goals

---

### Slide 10 (Layout: content)

**Title:** Goal-Setting Theory Applied

**Content:**
## Applying Goal-Setting Theory to Your PDP

| Principle | Application to PDP |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Specific goals** | Not "improve communication"—"Present at 3 NEU conferences by July 2026" |
| **Difficult goals** | Stretch beyond comfort zone—but remain achievable |
| **Feedback** | Build in progress checks: mentor meetings, quarterly reviews, tracking systems |
| **Commitment** | Align goals with VIA strengths, MBTI preferences, Holland Code interests |
| **Ability** | Include skill development in action steps—don't assume you're ready now |
| **Complexity** | Break 5-year goals into 3-year, then 1-year sub-goals |

### Slide 13 (Layout: content)

**Title:** SMART Goals in Higher Education

**Content:**
## Research: SMART Goals in Higher Education

**Martins van Jaarsveld et al. (2025)** - Systematic review of 60 studies (2010-2024)

**Key Findings:**
- SMART goal interventions are increasingly common (50%+ published in past 5 years)
- Most effective when **embedded in course activities** (not one-time exercises)
- **Extended prompts** (multiple sessions) outperform single-session activities

**Milestone Celebrations:**
- Recognize progress at key points

- Build positive reinforcement loops

**Review & Adjustment:**
- Quarterly reviews: Am I on track? What needs to change?
- Annual major review: Update 3-year and 5-year goals
- Bi-annual mentor check-ins for external perspective
