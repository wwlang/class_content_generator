::Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham)::According to Locke and Latham's (2002) goal-setting theory, which type of goals consistently produces higher performance than "do your best" goals?{
~General, flexible goals #Incorrect. General goals lack the direction and challenge needed to drive high performance. Locke and Latham found specific, difficult goals are more effective.
=Specific, difficult goals #Correct! Locke and Latham found that specific, difficult goals consistently outperform 'do your best' goals with effect sizes of 0.42 to 0.80 across meta-analyses.
~Easy, achievable goals #Incorrect. Easy goals don't energize effort or drive high performance. Goals must be challenging (difficult) to maximize motivation.
~Long-term, aspirational goals #Incorrect. While long-term goals matter, the key finding is about specificity and difficulty, not just time horizon.
####This finding has direct implications for your PDP. Vague goals like "improve my skills" are less effective than specific, challenging targets like "Complete Google Data Analytics Certificate by June 2026." See Week 11 slides 4-6.}

::Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham)::A student sets a goal to "improve my public speaking skills this semester." According to goal-setting theory, why would this goal be less effective than "deliver 8 prepared speeches in Toastmasters and achieve an average evaluation score of 4/5 by May 2026"?{
~The first goal is too ambitious and will reduce commitment #Incorrect. The first goal isn't too ambitious—it's actually too vague. The problem is lack of specificity, not ambition level.
=The first goal lacks specificity and measurability, reducing its ability to direct attention and effort #Correct! The first goal is vague—'improve' could mean anything—so it doesn't activate goal-setting theory's four mechanisms. The second goal is specific, measurable, and time-bound.
~The second goal requires too much feedback to be practical #Incorrect. Feedback through evaluations actually supports goal achievement. More feedback is generally better, not problematic.
~The first goal allows for more creativity and flexibility in approach #Incorrect. While flexibility can be valuable, vague goals don't provide the direction needed to energize effort and persistence.
####Test your PDP goals\: Does this goal clearly direct my attention? Does it energize my effort with a challenging target? Does it increase my persistence through a deadline? If any answer is "no," add more specificity. See Week 11 slides 7-8.}

::Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham)::According to Locke and Latham (2002), goals work through four mechanisms. A student sets a goal to "complete Google Data Analytics Certificate by June 2026." Which mechanism is demonstrated when the student decides to study for 2 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday instead of randomly when they feel like it?{
=Directing attention toward goal-relevant activities #Correct! By scheduling specific study times, the student is directing their attention toward goal-relevant activities and away from distractions.
~Energizing effort through higher goals #Incorrect. Energizing effort relates to the difficulty/challenge level of the goal itself, not the scheduling of activities.
~Increasing persistence over time #Incorrect. Persistence relates to continuing effort over time despite obstacles. Scheduling is about directing attention.
~Prompting development of task-relevant strategies #Incorrect. Strategy development involves figuring out HOW to accomplish tasks. Scheduling when to work is about attention direction.
####This mechanism is why your PDP needs action steps for each goal. Stating the goal is not enough—you need to specify how you'll direct your attention and time toward that goal. See Week 11 slides 9-10.}

::SMART Goals::In the SMART goals framework, what does the "A" stand for?{
~Ambitious #Incorrect. While goals should be challenging, 'A' stands for Achievable, not Ambitious. Goals must be realistic to maintain motivation.
=Achievable #Correct! The 'A' in SMART stands for Achievable, meaning the goal should be realistic given your resources, time, and constraints.
~Actionable #Incorrect. While goals should lead to action, the 'A' in SMART stands for Achievable, focusing on realistic possibility.
~Accountable #Incorrect. Accountability is important but not represented by the 'A' in SMART. It stands for Achievable.
####SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. When evaluating if your goals are achievable, consider\: Do you have the time, resources, and foundational skills? See Week 11 slide 11.}

::SMART Goals::A student writes\: "I will complete 3 online courses in digital marketing from Coursera, earn certificates for each, and build a portfolio of 5 course projects by December 31, 2026." Which SMART criteria does this goal clearly demonstrate?{
~Specific and Time-bound only #Incorrect. The goal also demonstrates measurability (3 courses, 5 projects, certificates). It's more than just specific and time-bound.
=Specific, Measurable, and Time-bound #Correct! The goal is Specific (3 Coursera courses in digital marketing), Measurable (3 certificates + 5 portfolio projects), and Time-bound (by December 31, 2026). We cannot determine Achievable or Relevant without more context.
~All five SMART criteria are clearly demonstrated #Incorrect. We cannot determine if it's Achievable (do they have time and skills?) or Relevant (does this align with their career vision?) without more context.
~Measurable and Relevant only #Incorrect. While it's measurable, we can't determine relevance without knowing the student's career vision. The goal is also clearly specific and time-bound.
####Context matters when evaluating SMART goals. The same goal might be achievable for one student but unrealistic for another. In your PDP, explicitly address achievability and relevance. See Week 11 slides 12-13.}

::SMART Goals (SRL Integration)::Martins van Jaarsveld et al. (2025) found that SMART goals fit within Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) cycle. If a student sets a SMART goal to "Present at 2 NEU student conferences by June 2026," in which SRL phase would they be operating when they check their progress in March 2026 and realize they've only secured 1 presentation slot, so they need to apply to 3 more conferences?{
~Forethought phase - goal-setting and planning #Incorrect. The forethought phase was when they initially set the goal. Checking progress and adjusting strategy occurs later.
=Performance phase - self-monitoring and strategy adjustment #Correct! The student is self-monitoring their progress (1 of 2 secured) and adjusting strategy (apply to 3 more conferences). This is the performance phase.
~Reflection phase - self-evaluation and learning #Incorrect. The reflection phase will be after June when they evaluate overall success. Mid-course progress checks are performance phase activities.
~This activity is not part of the SRL cycle #Incorrect. Self-monitoring and strategy adjustment are core activities of the SRL performance phase.
####This illustrates why your PDP needs accountability mechanisms. Self-monitoring and strategy adjustment are critical during the performance phase. In your PDP, specify how often you'll check progress and what you'll do if you're behind. See Week 11 slides 14-15.}

::OKR Framework::In the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework, what is the relationship between Objectives and Key Results?{
=Objectives are qualitative aspirations; Key Results are quantitative measures of success #Correct! Objectives state WHAT you want to achieve (qualitative, aspirational), while Key Results define HOW you'll measure success (quantitative, specific metrics).
~Objectives are short-term goals; Key Results are long-term goals #Incorrect. The distinction is not about time horizon but about qualitative (Objectives) vs. quantitative (Key Results).
~Objectives are measurable targets; Key Results are action steps #Incorrect. This reverses the relationship. Objectives are aspirational; Key Results are the measurable targets that prove achievement.
~Objectives and Key Results are interchangeable terms for the same concept #Incorrect. They serve distinct functions\: Objectives define aspiration; Key Results define evidence of achievement.
####Example - Objective\: "Become a confident public speaker." Key Results\: "Complete 10 Toastmasters speeches," "Achieve 4/5 average evaluation score," "Present at 2 conferences." See Week 11 slide 16.}

::OKR Framework::A student creates this OKR\: Objective\: "Become a confident public speaker" with Key Results\: (1) Complete Toastmasters program (10 speeches), (2) Receive average evaluation score of 4/5 or higher, (3) Present at 2 NEU conferences. According to Al-Saadi et al.'s (2023) research on OKR implementation, what is the primary value of structuring goals this way rather than just listing action items?{
~It makes the goal easier to achieve by breaking it into smaller parts #Incorrect. OKRs don't necessarily make goals easier—they create alignment between aspiration and measurable evidence of achievement.
=It creates alignment between aspirational vision and concrete evidence of achievement #Correct! The OKR framework aligns what you aspire to achieve (confident speaker) with how you'll prove you've achieved it (10 speeches, 4/5 scores, 2 conferences).
~It allows for more flexibility in changing your goals over time #Incorrect. OKRs provide structure and commitment, not primarily flexibility. The value is in clear success metrics.
~It reduces the need for feedback and progress monitoring #Incorrect. OKRs actually increase the need for monitoring because Key Results require tracking.
####This alignment addresses the "how will I know I've succeeded?" question that vague aspirations leave unanswered. When you can't think of measurable Key Results, your Objective may be too vague. See Week 11 slides 17-18.}

::OKR Framework::Al-Saadi et al. (2023) identified that OKR implementation requires training for both goal-setters and evaluators. For personal development plans, you are both the goal-setter and evaluator. A common challenge is setting Key Results that are too easy (100% confidence you'll achieve them). According to OKR philosophy discussed in the lecture, what confidence level suggests appropriately ambitious Key Results?{
~30-40% confidence (very ambitious, high risk) #Incorrect. 30-40% confidence is too risky and may lead to demotivation when goals aren't achieved.
~50-60% confidence (moderate stretch) #Incorrect. While a stretch, OKR philosophy specifically targets 70% confidence as the optimal level.
=70% confidence (challenging but achievable) #Correct! OKR philosophy suggests 70% confidence is the sweet spot—you're stretching beyond what's easy, but you genuinely believe the Key Results are achievable with focused effort.
~90-100% confidence (highly achievable) #Incorrect. If you're 100% certain, you're not being ambitious enough to drive growth. Goals should stretch you.
####Apply the 70% confidence test to your PDP goals. If the answer is 90-100%, increase the challenge. If the answer is 30-40%, scale back or extend the timeline. See Week 11 slide 19.}

::Career Roadmapping::According to the lecture, what is the recommended level of specificity for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year career goals in a Personal Development Plan?{
~All three horizons should have equal detail with month-by-month planning #Incorrect. Uncertainty increases over time, so long-term goals should be less specific to accommodate unpredictable circumstances.
=1-year\: high specificity; 3-year\: medium specificity; 5-year\: lower specificity #Correct! Specificity decreases as the timeline extends because uncertainty increases—you can't predict circumstances five years out with precision.
~5-year goals should be most specific since they're most important #Incorrect. 5-year goals should be aspirational/directional because you cannot predict exact circumstances that far in advance.
~Only 1-year goals need specific planning; 3- and 5-year goals are optional #Incorrect. All three horizons are important—they just require different levels of specificity appropriate to their timeframe.
####1-year goals should be highly detailed (month-by-month), 3-year goals should be directional (quarterly milestones), and 5-year goals should be aspirational (annual goals). See Week 11 slides 20-21.}

::Career Roadmapping::A student's 1-year roadmap is appropriate, but their 5-year goal states\: "In May 2030, be employed as Senior Marketing Analyst at Google Vietnam office in Ho Chi Minh City, managing a team of 3-4 junior analysts, with salary of 45 million VND per month." According to the lecture's guidance on career roadmapping, what is the problem with this 5-year goal?{
~It's too ambitious and unrealistic for someone just starting their career #Incorrect. The problem isn't ambition level—it's the false precision about circumstances you cannot predict or control.
=It's overly specific about circumstances you cannot control or predict five years out #Correct! You cannot predict which exact company will hire you, exact team size, or exact salary five years in advance. A better approach\: specify level, field, environment, and responsibilities without false precision.
~It doesn't connect logically to the 1-year goals #Incorrect. The question states the 1-year roadmap is appropriate. The issue is with the 5-year goal's specificity level.
~It should include more detail about specific projects and responsibilities #Incorrect. The goal already has too much detail. Adding more would compound the problem of false precision.
####A better 5-year goal\: "Senior Marketing Analyst position at international tech company, leading projects and mentoring junior team members." Specify level, field, environment, and responsibilities—but don't pretend you can predict exactly where. See Week 11 slides 22-23.}

::Career Roadmapping::According to goal-setting theory and the lecture's framework for career roadmapping, why might it be strategic to set "learning goals" for 3-year horizons and "performance goals" for 1-year horizons?{
~Learning goals are always more important than performance goals #Incorrect. Both types are important—the question is about when each type is most appropriate, not which is more important.
~Performance goals are too simple for 3-year planning #Incorrect. Performance goals aren't 'too simple'—they're just more appropriate for demonstrating current capabilities in shorter timeframes.
=Learning goals support skill acquisition for complex future roles; performance goals focus on demonstrating current capabilities #Correct! Learning goals focus on skill acquisition for 3-year horizons where you're developing expertise for future roles. Performance goals focus on demonstrating competence in current capabilities for 1-year execution.
~Three-year goals should avoid any focus on skills development #Incorrect. Skills development is exactly what 3-year learning goals should focus on—building capabilities for future roles.
####This progression—perform with current skills (Year 1) → develop new capabilities (Years 2-3) → leverage advanced expertise (Years 4-5)—creates a logical development arc in your PDP. See Week 11 slide 24.}
