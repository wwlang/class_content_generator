# Week 11: Designing Your Development Plan

## Tutorial Content (90 minutes)

### Quick Review (5 minutes)

**Instructor Script:**

"Welcome to today's tutorial. This is your dedicated time to finalize your Personal Development Plan—the most important assessment of this course, worth 40% of your grade. It's due Friday night at 11:59 PM via Google Form.

Today's structure is simple: I've given you the frameworks in the lecture—goal-setting theory, SMART goals, OKRs, SWOT, roadmaps, accountability. Now you apply them. You have 75 uninterrupted minutes to work on your PDP. I will circulate to provide individual support. This is NOT group work time—this is focused individual work time.

Before we begin, quick checklist—do you have with you:
- All 5 self-assessment results? (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, EI, Holland Code)
- Notes from all 4 mentorship meetings?
- Your draft SWOT analysis?
- Your laptop or materials to work?

If you're missing something critical, now's the time to access it online or retrieve it. You need these materials to complete your PDP today.

[Pause 1 minute for students to gather materials]

Quick reminder of what's due Friday: Self-Assessment Integration, SWOT + Skills Gap, Vision Statement + 6 SMART Goals with details, Mentor Integration from all 4 meetings, 1-3-5 Year Roadmap, Accountability Mechanisms, 200-word Reflection. Everything we've covered today.

Questions before we begin work time?

[Answer questions briefly]

Alright, you have 75 minutes starting now. I'll come around to each of you individually. If you need help, raise your hand and I'll come to you. Stay focused—phones away, no social media. This is your career we're planning. Let's go."

#### Instructor Circulation Strategy

**During these 75 minutes, circulate continuously to provide individual support. Visit each student at least once, prioritizing:**

1. **Students who raise hands** (immediate needs)
2. **Students who appear stuck** (staring, not writing)
3. **Students making visible progress** (quick encouragement + check quality)

**Common Student Questions and Response Framework:**

**Q: "I'm not sure which framework to use—SMART goals or OKRs?"**

**A:** "Both are acceptable. Here's how to decide: SMART goals work well for concrete, specific outcomes like 'Complete this certificate by this date.' OKRs work better when you have a big aspiration—like 'Become confident public speaker'—and need to define what success evidence looks like. Many students use SMART for short-term goals and OKRs for longer-term aspirations. Pick whichever helps you think more clearly. Show me one goal you're working on and let's structure it."

---

**Q: "My SWOT feels too vague. How do I make it more specific?"**

**A:** "Great awareness. Let's take one quadrant—show me your Strengths. [Reviews] These are good, but let's add evidence. Instead of 'good communicator,' try 'strong presentation skills demonstrated through NEU Marketing Club leadership and positive mentor feedback.' Instead of 'hardworking,' try 'consistently maintain 3.5+ GPA while working part-time.' Connect each strength to concrete evidence. Same for weaknesses—'struggle with time management' becomes 'often miss self-imposed deadlines, evidenced by last-minute assignment completion.' Specificity makes SWOT useful."

---

**Q: "How do I know if my goals are realistic? They feel too ambitious / too easy."**

**A:** "Good question. Here's the test: Are you about 70% confident you can achieve this goal? If you're 100% certain—'I will definitely do this no matter what'—aim higher. If you're only 30% confident—'this seems nearly impossible'—scale back or break it into sub-goals. Show me your most ambitious goal. [Reviews] Okay, so 'Become Marketing Director at multinational company by 2028' as a 3-year goal. You're graduating in 2026, so that's Director-level in 2 years post-graduation. What's your path? [Student explains] That timeline feels aggressive—most people spend 3-5 years at entry/mid-level before Director. Let's revise: 'Reach Senior Marketing Analyst or Marketing Manager position at multinational by 2028.' That's ambitious but achievable with strong performance. Then your 5-year goal can be Director-level."

---

**Q: "I don't have my mentor's validation statement yet. What should I do?"**

**A:** "You don't need the exact statement today—you need to show evidence that you've integrated their feedback and that you plan to get their validation. In Part 4, document what advice they gave you and how it influenced your plan. Then add a note: 'I will share my draft PDP with my mentor this week and request their validation statement before submission.' The key is showing their advice is actually reflected in your goals. Show me your mentor integration section—do I see specific examples from your meeting notes?"

---

**Q: "My 1-year timeline is too detailed. How much detail do you actually want?"**

**A:** "Show me what you have. [Reviews] Okay, this is excellent detail—you have monthly breakdowns, specific actions for each month. That's exactly right for Year 1. Your 3-year section doesn't need this much detail—quarterly milestones are fine. Your 5-year section can be just annual goals. The decreasing detail is intentional. You're not overdoing it—this is the right level for short-term planning."

---

**Q: "I'm stuck on my vision statement. I have 100 words and need to cut to 50. What do I cut?"**

**A:** "Read it to me. [Listens] Okay, this is good content but wordy. Let's tighten. You have three ideas: your values, your field, and your impact. Focus on those. Remove phrases like 'I hope to' and 'I believe that'—state it directly. Remove adjectives that don't add meaning—'very successful' becomes 'successful,' 'really passionate' becomes 'passionate.' Cut examples unless they're essential. Try this structure: 'I envision [type of career] leveraging [your key strengths] to [impact/contribution], guided by [1-2 core values].' That usually gets you under 50 words. Take 5 minutes to revise and show me the new version."

---

**Q: "How specific should my action steps be for each goal?"**

**A:** "Each goal needs 3-5 action steps that are concrete and sequential. For example, if your goal is 'Complete Google Digital Marketing Certificate by June 2026,' your action steps might be: 1) Purchase Coursera subscription by January 15, 2) Complete SEO module by end of February, 3) Complete SEM and Social Media modules by end of April, 4) Complete Analytics module and final project by June 1, 5) Add certificate to LinkedIn and resume by June 15. Notice these are specific, time-bound actions that build toward the goal. Avoid vague steps like 'study hard' or 'stay motivated.' What action steps do you have for your first goal? [Reviews and provides feedback]"

---

**Q: "I haven't completed all my self-assessments. Can I finish my PDP without them?"**

**A:** "No. The PDP requires integration of all 5 assessments—it's explicitly in the rubric. Self-Assessment Integration is 20% of your grade, and you need all 5 to identify patterns. Which assessments are you missing? [Student responds] Okay, you need to complete those before you can write your integration statement. Here's what to do: spend the next 20 minutes completing those assessments online—VIA takes 15 minutes, 16Personalities takes 12 minutes, EI assessment takes 10 minutes. Once you have results, come back to your PDP. I'll check in with you in 20 minutes."

---

**Q: "Can you review what I have so far and tell me if it's good enough?"**

**A:** "Show me what you've completed. [Reviews] Okay, let's go section by section. Your Self-Assessment Integration is strong—you've summarized all 5 and identified good patterns. Your SWOT is thorough. Your vision statement is clear and under 50 words. Good so far. Now let's look at your goals. [Reviews] This first goal—'Improve leadership skills'—isn't SMART. What specifically will you do to improve leadership? When will you complete it? How will you measure success? Let's revise this together. [Works through revision] Better: 'Complete NEU Leadership Development Program and lead one student organization project by May 2026, documented through program certificate and project portfolio.' See the difference? Make that level of revision to your other 5 goals. You're on the right track—just needs more specificity in the goals section."

#### What to Observe During Circulation

**Green Flags (Students on track):**
- Writing steadily, referring to notes/assessments
- Organized materials (assessments, mentor notes visible)
- Progressing through sections sequentially
- Goals include specific actions and timelines
- SWOT has detailed, evidence-based items

**Yellow Flags (Students needing support):**
- Staring at blank screen for >3 minutes
- Vague, generic language in draft sections
- Jumping between sections without completing any
- Missing key materials (no assessment results visible)
- Goals lack action steps or timelines

**Red Flags (Students at risk):**
- Distracted (phone, chatting, browsing unrelated content)
- Nothing written after 20+ minutes
- Expressing frustration or defeatism
- Missing multiple self-assessments
- Attempting to write PDP without any preparation

**For Yellow/Red Flag students:** Provide immediate, directive support. Sit with them, ask diagnostic questions ("What section are you working on? Where are you stuck?"), and help them create a specific plan for the next 15 minutes ("In the next 15 minutes, I want you to draft your SWOT Strengths quadrant with 5-7 items. Use your assessment results for evidence. I'll come back to check your progress.").

#### Mid-Session Check (Around 35-40 minutes)

**Brief Announcement to Class:**

"Quick progress check. By now, most of you should have completed or drafted your Self-Assessment Integration and SWOT sections and be working on your Vision Statement and SMART Goals. If you're not there yet, that's okay—but focus on completing one section at a time rather than jumping around.

Common issue I'm seeing: goals that aren't truly SMART. Remember—every goal needs all five elements: Specific (exactly what), Measurable (how you'll know), Achievable (realistic), Relevant (aligned with vision), Time-bound (deadline). If your goal is missing any of these, revise it now.

You have 35 minutes remaining. Stay focused. If you need help, raise your hand."

### Before Next Class (10 minutes)

**Instructor Summary (at 75-minute mark):**

"Time check—we're at 75 minutes. Please save your work if you haven't already. Look up for final instructions.

[Wait for attention]

Thank you for your focus today. Here's what happens between now and Friday:

**Tonight/Tomorrow:**
- Complete any sections you didn't finish today
- Revise goals to ensure they're truly SMART (all 5 elements)
- Check that your Skills Gap Analysis has 8+ skills with current/target levels
- Verify you have evidence from all 4 mentor meetings in Part 4

**By Wednesday:**
- Complete your entire first draft
- Share draft with your mentor if you haven't already (they need time to provide validation statement)
- Ask mentor: 'Does this plan reflect our discussions? Will you provide a brief validation statement?'
- Self-review using the checklist in the Assessment Handbook

**Thursday:**
- Incorporate mentor's validation statement
- Final proofreading (spelling, grammar, formatting)
- Check that all required components are included
- Prepare to submit via Google Form

**Friday (Deadline Day):**
- Google Form submission link will be posted on course management system
- Due 11:59 PM (Vietnam time)
- Late penalty: 10% per day
- No submissions accepted after December 2

**Critical Reminders:**

1. **This is 40% of your grade.** Give it the time and effort it deserves.

2. **Your PDP must reflect YOU.** Generic, ChatGPT-generated plans are obvious and will be penalized. Use AI for brainstorming if helpful, but your final submission must demonstrate authentic self-reflection and personal goals.

3. **Mentor validation is required.** If your mentor is difficult to reach, send them your draft by email and request validation by Thursday. If you have genuine issues accessing your mentor, email me immediately—don't wait until Friday.

4. **The Google Form is your backup.** Complete your PDP in a Word document first, then copy/paste into the form. This way you have a backup if there are technical issues.

5. **Your oral exam will be based on this PDP.** During exam period, you'll present your development plan for 10 minutes + 5-minute Q&A. Start thinking about how to translate your written plan into presentation slides. We'll discuss oral exam logistics in Week 12.

**Questions?**

[Answer questions about logistics, deadline, requirements]

**Next Week Preview:**

Week 12 is our final week: Integration and Continuous Growth. We'll discuss values-career alignment, systems thinking, and continuous improvement strategies. This is about maintaining the momentum you've built throughout the semester. Your PDP should be submitted by then, and we'll focus on lifelong growth mindset.

**One Final Thought:**

Your Personal Development Plan isn't just an assignment—it's a blueprint for your next five years. Many NEU alumni tell me years later that their PDP was the most valuable thing they created in university because it gave them direction when everyone else was drifting. Take this seriously. Invest the time. Your future self will thank you.

See you in Week 12. Good luck with your final PDP work this week."
