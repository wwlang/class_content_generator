## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Locke & Latham's Goal-Setting Theory:** Specific, difficult goals outperform "do your best" goals through 4 mechanisms (direction, effort, persistence, strategy development). Effect size d = 0.42-0.82 (medium-large).

- **Four Moderators:** Goals work best with: (1) feedback, (2) goal commitment, (3) manageable task complexity, (4) adequate ability. Check your goals against these.

- **SMART Goals:** All 5 criteria required—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. Most people label goals SMART without making them truly SMART.

- **OKR Framework:** Objectives (qualitative aspiration) + Key Results (quantitative metrics). Use for 3-5 year goals where specificity is harder. 60-70% achievement = success.

- **Personal SWOT:** Internal (Strengths/Weaknesses from self-assessments + skills gap) + External (Opportunities/Threats from Vietnam market + AI trends). Goals should leverage S, address W, capture O, mitigate T.

- **Accountability Mechanisms:** Public commitment + tracking system + accountability partner + milestones + consequences = 65%+ higher achievement rate.

**What excellent work looks like:**
- Goals are SO specific you could start executing Monday
- Clear golden thread: self-assessments → SWOT → goals → mentor feedback → implementation
- Vision statement authentic (sounds like YOU, not corporate jargon)
- Every goal passes SMART test (not just labeled SMART)
- Mentor feedback visibly integrated throughout (not isolated in Part 4)

**Full rubric:** Assessment Handbook, Personal Development Plan Rubric (pp. 680-686)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

1. **Completed** all six PDP sections in near-final form (80%+ ready for submission)
2. **Strengthened** SMART goals through SMART criteria quality check
3. **Integrated** all components into coherent narrative (golden thread visible)
4. **Received** peer feedback on PDP quality using rubric criteria
5. **Identified** final revisions needed before Friday submission
6. **Developed** confidence in your PDP's quality and completeness

---

## Activity 1: SMART Goals Quality Check (25 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** PDP Part 3 (Vision & Goals) is worth 30% of PDP grade = 12% of course grade. Weak goals = automatic C-range grade. This activity ensures your goals are truly SMART.

**The Task:**

Review EACH of your 6+ goals against all five SMART criteria. Transform vague goals into truly SMART goals using the quality check template.

**Deliverable:**

Minimum 6 revised SMART goals ready for PDP Part 3.

**Success Criteria:**
- Every goal passes all five SMART criteria (not 4/5, not "mostly SMART")
- Goals activate all four Locke & Latham mechanisms (direction, effort, persistence, strategy)
- 1-year goals very specific; 3-5 year goals use OKR format if appropriate
- Action steps detailed enough to execute immediately

---

### SMART Goals Quality Check Template

**Instructions:** For EACH goal, test against all five criteria. If any criterion fails, revise goal until it passes.

---

#### Goal 1 (Short-Term: 1-Year)

**Original Goal Statement:**

---

**SMART Criteria Test:**

**S — Specific**
- ❓ Does it answer: What exactly will I achieve? (not vague like "improve" or "develop")
- ❓ Can someone else read this and know precisely what success looks like?
- ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL

**M — Measurable**
- ❓ Can I quantify progress? (numbers, percentages, completion yes/no)
- ❓ Will I know definitively when I've achieved this? (no ambiguity)
- ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL

**A — Achievable**
- ❓ Given my current skills, resources, and time, is this realistic?
- ❓ Is it a stretch (not too easy) but not impossible?
- ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL

**R — Relevant**
- ❓ Does this align with my vision statement and values (Part 1)?
- ❓ Does it leverage my strengths or address critical weaknesses (SWOT)?
- ❓ Does it connect to my 3-year and 5-year goals?
- ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL

**T — Time-Bound**
- ❓ Is there a specific deadline? (exact date or month/year)
- ❓ Are there interim milestones with dates?
- ✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL

**SMART Score: ___/5 criteria passed**

---

**If <5, Revise Goal:**

**Revised Goal Statement:**

---

**Locke & Latham Mechanisms Check:**

Does this goal activate all four mechanisms?
- **Direction:** Does it focus my attention on specific activities? ☐ Yes ☐ No
- **Effort:** Is it difficult enough to require significant effort? ☐ Yes ☐ No
- **Persistence:** Is there a timeline that requires sustained action? ☐ Yes ☐ No
- **Strategy:** Is it complex enough to require planning/problem-solving? ☐ Yes ☐ No

**If any "No," consider making goal more specific or challenging.**

---

**Action Steps (3-5 concrete actions):**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Resources Needed:**
-

**Success Metrics:**
-

**Potential Obstacles:**
-

**Mitigation Strategies:**
-

---

**Repeat this process for ALL 6+ goals (3 short-term, 2 medium-term, 1+ long-term).**

---

### Common SMART Goal Failures & Fixes

**Failure Type 1: Not Specific**
- ❌ "Improve my communication skills"
- ✅ "Deliver 8 presentations to audiences of 15+ people in academic and professional settings by June 2026, achieving average feedback score of 4.0/5.0 on clarity and engagement"

**Failure Type 2: Not Measurable**
- ❌ "Network with professionals in consulting"
- ✅ "Conduct 15 informational interviews with consultants at Big 4 and boutique firms by March 2026, documented with LinkedIn connection and post-interview reflection notes"

**Failure Type 3: Not Achievable**
- ❌ "Become fluent in 4 languages by next year" (current: English + basic French)
- ✅ "Achieve Spanish conversational fluency (B2 level, verified by DELE exam) by December 2026 through 200 hours of Duolingo + weekly conversation partner meetings"

**Failure Type 4: Not Relevant**
- ❌ "Learn to play guitar" (unrelated to business career vision)
- ✅ "Complete financial modeling certification relevant to investment banking goal by August 2026"
- *(Unless guitar IS relevant—e.g., music business career or wellbeing goal. Then include relevance explanation.)*

**Failure Type 5: Not Time-Bound**
- ❌ "Get promoted to senior analyst"
- ✅ "Earn promotion to Senior Business Analyst by Q3 2028 through (1) exceeding performance targets 3 consecutive quarters, (2) leading 2 cross-functional projects, (3) obtaining PMP certification by Q1 2028"

**Tutor Notes:**

**Facilitation:**
- Circulate and spot-check goals—most students will have 2-3 that aren't truly SMART
- Common issue: Goals are vague but students think they're SMART because they have a number
- Push on SPECIFICITY and MEASURABILITY—these fail most often

**Red Flags:**
- Goal has only 3/5 SMART criteria → must revise
- Goal is comfortable, not challenging → not activating Locke & Latham mechanisms
- 1-year goal says "improve" or "develop" without concrete deliverable
- 5-year goal is too tactical (that's 1-year level detail)

**Strong Goal Indicators:**
- You can visualize exactly what achieving this goal looks like
- Success is binary (you either did it or didn't—no ambiguity)
- Reading it makes you slightly nervous (stretch goal)
- Action steps could be executed starting Monday

**Time Management:**
- 25 minutes for 6 goals = ~4 min per goal
- Students should focus on SHORT-TERM goals (most critical, most detailed)
- Medium/long-term goals can use OKR format (less granular)

---

## Activity 2: Integration Check — Finding the Golden Thread (20 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Rubric heavily weights INTEGRATION across all six PDP parts. Disconnected sections = C-grade maximum. This activity ensures coherence.

**The Task:**

Map connections between PDP parts to verify integration. Identify gaps where sections don't align. Revise to create coherent narrative.

**Deliverable:**

Completed Integration Map showing clear connections across all six parts.

**Success Criteria:**
- Every goal traceable to self-assessment insight or SWOT analysis
- Mentor feedback visibly influences SWOT and/or goals
- Vision statement clearly reflected in goal selection
- Implementation plan matches goal difficulty and timeline

---

### Integration Mapping Template

**Instructions:** Complete each section, then verify connections.

---

#### Part 1 → Part 2 Connection

**From Self-Assessments, my top 3 patterns are:**
1.
2.
3.

**These appear in my SWOT as:**
- **Strengths:** [List which SWOT strengths derive from assessments]
- **Weaknesses:** [List which weaknesses derive from skills gap analysis]

**Integration Quality Check:**
✓ Strong: All VIA/CliftonStrengths appear in SWOT Strengths
✓ Strong: Skills gap analysis identifies weaknesses
✗ Weak: SWOT Strengths are generic, not tied to specific assessment results

---

#### Part 2 → Part 3 Connection

**From SWOT, my strategic priorities are:**
- **Leverage these Strengths:** [List 2-3 key strengths]
- **Address these Weaknesses:** [List 2-3 priority gaps]
- **Capture these Opportunities:** [List 2-3 market opportunities]
- **Mitigate these Threats:** [List 2-3 major challenges]

**My goals address these priorities:**

| SMART Goal (abbreviated) | Leverages Strength | Addresses Weakness | Captures Opportunity | Mitigates Threat |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Goal 1: | [Which S?] | [Which W?] | [Which O?] | [Which T?] |
| Goal 2: | | | | |
| Goal 3: | | | | |
| Goal 4: | | | | |
| Goal 5: | | | | |
| Goal 6: | | | | |

**Integration Quality Check:**
✓ Strong: Every goal connects to at least one SWOT quadrant (ideally 2-3)
✗ Weak: Goals seem random, not strategic responses to SWOT

---

#### Part 1 & Part 3 → Vision Statement Connection

**My Vision Statement (50 words max):**

---

**How my goals serve this vision:**
- Goal 1 serves vision by: [stepping stone to vision]
- Goal 2 serves vision by:
- Goal 3 serves vision by:
- [Continue for all goals]

**Integration Quality Check:**
✓ Strong: Vision is North Star; every goal is stepping stone toward it
✗ Weak: Goals and vision seem unrelated (vision says "social impact," goals all say "corporate finance")

---

#### Part 4 → Parts 2 & 3 Connection

**Key mentor advice from 4 meetings:**

**Meeting 1:**
- Advice:
- Influenced PDP section: [Which part? How?]

**Meeting 2:**
- Advice:
- Influenced PDP section:

**Meeting 3:**
- Advice:
- Influenced PDP section:

**Meeting 4:**
- Advice:
- Influenced PDP section:

**Integration Quality Check:**
✓ Strong: Specific mentor advice shaped SWOT analysis and/or goal selection
✓ Strong: Can identify which goals changed based on mentor feedback
✗ Weak: Mentor feedback isolated in Part 4, doesn't influence other sections

---

#### Part 3 → Part 5 Connection

**For each major goal, accountability mechanism:**

| Goal (abbreviated) | Progress Tracking | Public Commitment | Accountability Partner | Milestones | Consequences |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Goal 1: | [System?] | [Who knows?] | [Who checks?] | [When?] | [Reward/cost?] |
| Goal 2: | | | | | |
| Goal 3: | | | | | |

**Integration Quality Check:**
✓ Strong: Every goal has ALL five accountability mechanisms
✗ Weak: Vague accountability ("I'll track progress") with no specifics

---

### Peer Review: Golden Thread Audit

**Partner with classmate. Exchange Integration Maps. Provide feedback:**

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **Self-Assessment → SWOT:** Are strengths clearly derived from VIA/CliftonStrengths? ☐ Yes ☐ No
   - If No: Which strengths need assessment evidence?

2. **SWOT → Goals:** Does every goal connect to at least one SWOT quadrant? ☐ Yes ☐ No
   - If No: Which goal seems disconnected from strategy?

3. **Vision → Goals:** Do goals collectively move toward vision? ☐ Yes ☐ No
   - If No: Which goal doesn't serve the vision?

4. **Mentor → SWOT/Goals:** Is mentor influence visible beyond Part 4? ☐ Yes ☐ No
   - If No: Where should mentor advice appear?

5. **Goals → Implementation:** Does accountability match goal difficulty? ☐ Yes ☐ No
   - If No: Which goal needs stronger accountability?

**Partner's Overall Integration Assessment:**
- ☐ Strong: Clear golden thread across all parts
- ☐ Adequate: Some connections visible, some gaps
- ☐ Weak: Parts feel disconnected

**One specific integration strength:**

**One specific integration gap to fix:**

---

**Tutor Notes:**

**Facilitation:**
- Integration is HARDEST part of PDP for students
- Many have strong individual sections but weak connections
- Push students to REVISE goals if they don't align with SWOT/vision

**Common Integration Failures:**
- SWOT Strengths list generic qualities ("hardworking," "creative") not tied to assessments
- Goals don't leverage strengths (missed opportunity)
- Goals don't address weaknesses (no development focus)
- Mentor feedback mentioned but not integrated into decisions
- Vision statement aspirational but goals are tactical/unrelated

**Strong Integration Indicators:**
- Can trace each goal back to specific assessment result + SWOT analysis
- Mentor's specific advice visible in goal wording
- Vision statement + goals tell ONE coherent story

**Intervention:**
- If student has disconnected parts, help them revise ONE goal to align properly
- Show how to trace: "Your VIA Creativity + Holland A → SWOT Strength 'Creative problem-solving' → Goal 'Design 3 marketing campaigns for real clients by Dec 2026'"

---

## Activity 3: Peer Review Using Rubric Criteria (30 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Final quality check before submission. Peer review catches errors and gaps you might miss. Studies show peer-reviewed assignments score 15-20% higher.

**The Task:**

Exchange complete PDP drafts with partner. Conduct structured peer review using Assessment Handbook rubric criteria. Provide written feedback. Revise based on feedback received.

**Deliverable:**

Peer feedback form + list of final revisions needed before Friday submission.

**Success Criteria:**
- Comprehensive review of all six PDP parts
- Specific, actionable feedback (not "looks good")
- Identification of rubric weaknesses (where points will be lost)
- Commitment to specific revisions before submission

**Tutor Notes:**

**Facilitation:**
- Students should exchange with someone OUTSIDE their usual group (fresh eyes)
- Set timer: 15 min review (strict), 15 min revision based on feedback
- Circulate to ensure reviewers are specific, not just checking boxes

**Quality Control:**
- Spot-check peer reviews—are they substantive or superficial?
- If review says "looks good" with no specific feedback, it's inadequate
- Strong peer review identifies AT LEAST 3 specific improvements

**Common Issues Students Miss:**
- Word count wrong (Part 6 reflection must be EXACTLY 200 words)
- Goals not truly SMART (labeled SMART but fail criteria)
- SWOT items too generic
- Mentor validation missing or doesn't confirm draft review
- Integration gaps (goals don't align with strengths/vision)

**Intervention Points:**
- If predicted grade is C or below, tutor should review PDP briefly and confirm issues
- Recommend student attend office hours before submission if major problems

**Signature:** _______________ **Date:** _______________

---

**Tutor Notes:**

**Facilitation:**
- Students should complete this checklist in tutorial (creates accountability)
- Emphasize: PDP due in 2-4 days depending on section—this is final push
- Students who can't check most boxes are at risk—flag for intervention

**Reality Check:**
- Ask: "How many hours do you need for revisions? Do you have that time before Friday?"
- If student needs 10 hours and it's Thursday, they're in trouble
- Recommend: Prioritize ruthlessly—fix what loses points, skip perfection on minor issues

**Mentor Validation Crisis:**
- If student doesn't have mentor validation yet, they must contact mentor TODAY
- Provide template email to send mentor (in tutor guide)
- Worst case: Student submits PDP with note "Awaiting mentor validation, will update," but this loses points

**Submission Logistics:**
- Google Form link provided in course materials
- Form has fields for each PDP section (students copy/paste)
- Also requires Word document attachment as backup
- Test submission early to avoid tech issues at 11:58 PM Friday

## Common Last-Minute Issues (& Solutions)

**Issue 1: Mentor validation not obtained**
- **Solution:** Email mentor TODAY with this template:
  - "Dear [Mentor Name], My Personal Development Plan is due Friday. Could you please review the attached draft and provide a 50-100 word validation statement confirming: (1) you reviewed it, (2) it reflects our meetings, (3) you support my direction? I need this by Thursday evening. Thank you!"
- **Backup:** Submit PDP with note "Mentor validation pending, will update" (loses points but better than missing deadline)

**Issue 2: Goals still not truly SMART after review**
- **Solution:** Use lecture Slide 10 examples as templates
- **Formula:** [Action verb] + [Quantified outcome] + [Context] + [Deadline] + [How you'll measure success]
- **Example:** "Complete [specific certification] + apply skills in [number] projects by [date], achieving [metric]"

**Issue 3: SWOT too generic**
- **Solution:** Add specificity
  - Generic: "Good communication skills"
  - Specific: "VIA Social Intelligence strength + IELTS 7.5 + experience presenting to NEU professors"

**Issue 4: No integration between parts**
- **Solution:** Add explicit connection sentences
  - "This goal leverages my VIA Creativity strength (Part 1) and addresses the Opportunity of Vietnam's growing design sector (Part 2 SWOT)."

**Issue 5: Word count wrong**
- **Solution:** Use Word's word count tool (Tools → Word Count)
- Part 6 reflection = EXACTLY 200 words (±5 words)
- Vision statement = 50 words MAXIMUM (not approximate)

**Issue 6: Missing implementation timeline**
- **Solution:** Create simple month-by-month table
  - January 2026: [Action]
  - February 2026: [Action]
  - March 2026: [Milestone]
  - (Continue through December 2026)
  - 2027: Q1 [Action], Q2 [Milestone], Q3 [Action], Q4 [Milestone]

## Connection to Final Oral Exam (Week 12)

**Your PDP becomes your presentation:**
- Week 12 exam period: 15-minute oral presentation (10 min + 5 min Q&A)
- Worth 30% of course grade
- You'll present THIS PDP you're submitting Friday

**Strong PDP = Strong Presentation:**
- Clear vision → compelling opening
- Well-integrated goals → easy to explain rationale
- Authentic reflection → confident delivery

**Start thinking now:**
- Which 2-3 goals will you highlight in presentation? (can't present all 6 in 10 min)
- What's your most interesting self-assessment pattern? (engaging for audience)
- What mentor advice will you share? (shows external validation)

**Presentation prep starts after submission:**
- Don't wait until exam day to think about it
- 10-12 slides recommended (structure in Assessment Handbook p. 635-636)
