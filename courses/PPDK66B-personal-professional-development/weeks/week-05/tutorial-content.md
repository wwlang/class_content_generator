# Week 5 Tutorial: Self-Assessment Integration Workshop

**Course:** PPDK66B Personal & Professional Development
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** This workshop directly prepares Part 1 (Self-Knowledge Foundation) of your Personal Development Plan (40%), which requires: (1) summaries of all 5 assessments with career implications, and (2) a 200-300 word integration statement identifying patterns. It also prepares you for Mentorship Meeting #2 where you share and discuss assessment results with your mentor.

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Johari Window:** Four quadrants of self-knowledge (Open, Blind, Hidden, Unknown) — assessment tools help reveal the Unknown area while mentorship reduces the Blind Spot
- **MBTI Critical Evaluation:** Popular but weak validity (only 2.8% of correlations strong) — use for self-reflection but not career decisions
- **VIA Character Strengths:** 24 strengths across 6 virtues — using signature strengths (top 5-7) increases wellbeing and performance
- **CliftonStrengths Caution:** Recent research shows weak reliability in college students — focus more on VIA, use CliftonStrengths language as ONE input
- **Holland RIASEC Model:** Six interest types (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) — career satisfaction highest when job matches your 3-letter code
- **Integration Framework:** List results → Identify patterns → Note contradictions → Generate hypotheses → Test through experience

**What good work looks like:**
- Integration statement identifies 2-3 clear patterns across assessments with specific evidence
- Thoughtfully addresses contradictions rather than ignoring them
- Generates actionable career hypotheses with both "thrive in" and "struggle with" scenarios
- Uses assessment terminology correctly (e.g., "VIA Perspective strength" not "I'm wise")
- Demonstrates nuanced self-understanding, not just listing results

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Personal Development Plan Rubric — Part 1 (Self-Assessment Integration) is worth 20% of PDP grade, which is 40% of course grade = 8% of final grade directly tied to today's work.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. **Document** all five assessment results with career implications (PDP Part 1 requirement)
2. **Identify** patterns across multiple assessments using the integration framework
3. **Address** contradictions thoughtfully without forcing false coherence
4. **Generate** career hypotheses based on integrated self-knowledge
5. **Practice** articulating self-assessment insights (preparation for Mentorship Meeting #2)
6. **Provide and receive** peer feedback on integration quality

---

## Activity 1: Individual Documentation (25 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** This directly produces content for PDP Part 1 — Self-Assessment Summary section.

**The Task:**

Complete the Self-Assessment Summary Template for ALL five assessments. You will use this exact content in your Personal Development Plan.

**Deliverable:**

A completed template with 5 assessment summaries + preliminary integration notes.

**Success Criteria:**
- Each assessment summary includes: (1) specific results (type/strengths/code), (2) key insights about yourself, (3) implications for career fit or work environment
- Career implications are specific, not generic ("I'd thrive in data-driven consulting roles" not "I'm good with numbers")
- You identify at least 2-3 initial patterns to explore in Activity 2

---

### Self-Assessment Summary Template

**Copy this template to your notebook or laptop. You will transfer this to your PDP later.**

---

#### Assessment 1: MBTI/16 Personalities

**My Type:** __________ (e.g., INTJ, ESFP)

**Key Insights About My Personality:**

- Decision making (T/F):
- Lifestyle orientation (J/P):

**Implications for Career Fit:**
- Work environments where I'd thrive:
- Work environments where I'd struggle:
- Communication style implications:

**Critical Note:** I recognize MBTI has weak validity (Erford et al., 2025) and use it for self-reflection, not career limitation.

---

#### Assessment 2: VIA Character Strengths

**My Top 5 Signature Strengths:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**How These Strengths Show Up in My Life Currently:**

- Theme #2:
- Theme #3:

**Development Strategies for Each Theme:**
- How to turn talent into strength through practice:

**Critical Note:** I recognize CliftonStrengths has weak reliability in college students (Reid & Short, 2024) and weight VIA more heavily.

---

**My 3-Letter Code:** __________ (e.g., ASE, RIC)

**Primary Type Explanation:**
- 1st letter:
- 2nd letter:
- 3rd letter:

---

#### Preliminary Integration Notes

**Patterns I Notice Across Assessments:**
1.
2.
3.

**Contradictions or Surprises:**
1.
2.

**Initial Career Hypotheses:**
- I would thrive in careers/environments that...
- I would struggle in careers/environments that...

---

**Tutor Notes:**

Circulate during this activity to:
- Ensure students have all assessment results (if not, direct them to computers to complete now)
- Check that career implications are SPECIFIC (not "I'm a people person" but "I'd excel in client-facing consulting roles requiring relationship building")
- Encourage critical thinking notes on MBTI and CliftonStrengths validity
- Remind students: this is DRAFT content for PDP — they'll polish later

**Common Issues:**
- **Too generic:** "I'm creative" → "My VIA Creativity + Holland Artistic type + CliftonStrengths Ideation suggest I need roles with innovation and autonomy"
- **Just listing results:** "My VIA strengths are X, Y, Z" → "My VIA Perspective strength appears in how I help friends solve problems by seeing multiple viewpoints"
- **No career implications:** Add "So what does this mean for my career?" to each section

---

## Activity 2: Small Group Integration Practice (30 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** This develops the 200-300 word Integration Statement required in PDP Part 1.

**The Task:**

Work in groups of 3-4 to practice the Five-Step Integration Framework from lecture. Each person shares results, receives peer feedback, and drafts their integration statement.

**Deliverable:**

A 200-300 word integration statement (draft) that will become part of your PDP Part 1.

**Success Criteria:**
- Statement identifies 2-3 clear patterns with evidence from multiple assessments
- Addresses at least one contradiction or surprise
- Generates career hypotheses (both "thrive" and "struggle" scenarios)
- Uses assessment terminology correctly
- Feels authentic and personal, not generic

---

### Small Group Process (7-8 min per person)

**Step 1: Share Results (3 minutes per person)**

Person A presents:
- "My MBTI is _____, my Holland Code is _____, my top VIA strengths are _____..."
- Highlight 1-2 key insights from each assessment
- Note any contradictions or surprises

Group members listen actively and take notes on patterns they notice.

**Step 2: Group Pattern Identification (2 minutes per person)**

Group discusses:
- "We notice these themes across your assessments..."
- "Your MBTI _____ aligns with your Holland _____ because..."
- "The contradiction between _____ and _____ might mean..."

**Step 3: Career Hypothesis Generation (2 minutes per person)**

Group helps generate:
- "Based on your profile, you'd probably thrive in..."
- "You might struggle in environments that..."
- "Careers that leverage your _____ + _____ combo include..."

**Step 4: Individual Drafting (10 minutes after all share)**

Each person writes their 200-300 word integration statement using this structure:

---

### Integration Statement Template

**Paragraph 1: Patterns (100-150 words)**

"Across five assessments, I see consistent themes of [THEME 1] and [THEME 2]. [Provide specific evidence from 3+ assessments]. For example, my [MBTI preference/VIA strength/CliftonStrengths theme/Holland type] combined with [another assessment result] suggests [insight about yourself]."

**Paragraph 2: Contradictions & Nuance (50-75 words)**

"[Address one contradiction or surprising result]. This makes sense when I consider [context or example]. Rather than seeing this as inconsistency, I now understand [more nuanced insight]."

**Paragraph 3: Career Implications (50-75 words)**

"These insights suggest I would thrive in [specific career types/environments] where I can [leverage specific strengths]. I should be cautious about roles requiring [things that don't match your profile] as they may lead to dissatisfaction. My next step is [action based on this self-knowledge]."

---

**Example Integration Statement (275 words):**

"Across five assessments, I see consistent themes of **analytical problem-solving** and **independent work**. My INTJ personality type emphasizes strategic thinking and autonomy, which aligns with my Holland Code IRA (Investigative-Realistic-Artistic) and my top VIA strength of Judgment. CliftonStrengths confirmed this with Strategic, Analytical, and Learner in my top five. This pattern suggests I'm energized by complex problems that require deep analysis and creative solutions, particularly when I can work independently or in small expert teams.

The contradiction between my MBTI Introversion and my VIA strength of Leadership initially surprised me. However, reflecting on experiences, I realize I lead through expertise and strategic vision, not charisma or public speaking. I'm the person who develops the plan and guides execution quietly, not the one rallying crowds. This is "quiet leadership," which research shows is equally effective (Grant, 2013).

These insights suggest I would thrive in **strategy consulting, data analytics, or product management roles** where I solve complex business problems using analytical frameworks. I should avoid highly routine work (underutilizes my Investigative Holland type) or roles requiring constant public performance (doesn't match my I preference). My VIA Perspective strength combined with CliftonStrengths Strategic theme suggests I'd excel in roles requiring systems thinking and long-term planning. My next step is exploring internships in management consulting or tech product teams to test these hypotheses in real-world contexts."

---

**Tutor Notes:**

**Group Formation:**
- Mix personality types if possible (don't group all introverts together)
- Ensure at least one person per group has strong writing skills to help others

**Facilitation:**
- Set a visible timer for each person's 7-8 minute share slot
- Encourage depth over breadth — better to explore 2 patterns deeply than list 5 superficially

**Common Issues:**
- **Forcing coherence:** Remind students contradictions are INTERESTING, not problems to solve
- **Too much jargon:** "I'm an INTJ with Analytical and Strategic themes" is fine, but explain what it MEANS
- **No career specificity:** Push beyond "business" to "financial analysis," "marketing strategy," etc.

**Strong Integration Indicators:**
- Uses specific assessment language correctly
- Provides concrete examples from life
- Acknowledges nuance and complexity
- Makes testable predictions about career fit

## Activity 3: Mentorship Meeting #2 Preparation (20 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Mentorship Meeting #2 (worth 20% of grade) should focus on sharing assessment results and seeking mentor's perspective. This activity ensures you're prepared for that conversation.

**The Task:**

Prepare for your upcoming Mentorship Meeting #2 using the structured template below. Your mentor's feedback will become part of PDP Part 4 (Mentor Integration).

**Deliverable:**

#### Updates Since Last Meeting

**Actions I've taken:**
-
-

**Progress on previous advice:**
-

**Challenges I've encountered:**
-

---

**Tutor Notes:**

**Facilitation:**
- Students should actually draft this during tutorial (not "homework")
- Pair students to review each other's questions — good questions are specific and open-ended
- Emphasize: mentor's role is to provide EXTERNAL perspective (Johari Window Blind Spot reduction)

**Common Issues:**
- **Closed questions:** "Do you think I should do consulting?" → "What aspects of my profile suggest consulting fit, and what concerns would you have?"
- **Too many questions:** Better to explore 5 questions deeply than rush through 10
- **No vulnerability:** Encourage sharing contradictions and uncertainties — that's where mentor wisdom helps most

**Strong Question Indicators:**
- Invites mentor's expertise and experience
- Shows you've reflected before asking
- Allows for detailed, thoughtful responses
- Directly supports PDP development

**Meeting #2 Success = Evidence for PDP Part 4:**
- Document mentor's feedback on assessment accuracy
- Record specific advice on career fit
- Note insights that changed your thinking
- Identify which PDP sections mentor input influenced
