# Week 5 Tutorial: Assessment Integration Workshop

**Course:** PPDK66B Personal & Professional Development
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** This tutorial directly prepares you for Part 1 of your Personal Development Plan (20% of PDP grade), specifically the 200-300 word integration statement that identifies patterns across all 5 self-assessments. The cross-assessment analysis you practice today forms the foundation of your SWOT analysis, SMART goals, and overall career strategy. Students who complete this workshop thoughtfully will write stronger, more coherent PDPs with clearer career direction.

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**
- **Johari Window:** Four quadrants of self-knowledge (Open, Blind Spot, Hidden, Unknown)—self-awareness requires both internal reflection AND external feedback
- **MBTI validity:** Acceptable reliability (α = 0.85-0.92) but weak validity (r < 0.50)—use as conversation starter, not career prescription
- **VIA Character Strengths:** 24 strengths across 6 virtues; signature strengths (top 5-7) are energizing and authentic
- **CliftonStrengths caution:** Reid & Short (2024) found only 8 of 34 themes reliable for college students—prioritize VIA when results conflict
- **Holland Code (RIASEC):** Person-environment fit predicts satisfaction (r = .17)—use to filter career options, not eliminate them
- **Integration is key:** Patterns across assessments reveal coherent themes; contradictions reveal complexity

**What good integration looks like:**
- Identifies 2-3 consistent patterns across assessments with specific examples
- Acknowledges contradictions and interprets them thoughtfully (not dismisses them)
- Connects assessment insights to concrete career implications
- Demonstrates critical thinking about assessment validity

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Personal Development Plan Rubric—"Self-Assessment Integration" (20% of PDP grade) evaluates completeness, depth of insight, and synthesis quality.

## Activity 1: Cross-Assessment Pattern Mapping (30 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Learning to identify convergence across assessments is the core skill for PDP Part 1. Your integration statement must identify patterns—not just list results. This activity teaches the analytical thinking required.

**The Challenge:**
You'll create a visual map showing how your 5 assessment results relate to each other, then identify 2-3 career-relevant themes that emerge.

### Step 1: Individual Mapping (15 minutes)

**Your Task:**
Create a visual map of your assessment results using this structure:

```
                    YOUR NAME
                        |
        ________________________________
        |       |        |       |      |
      MBTI    VIA   Clifton    EI   Holland
        |       |        |       |      |
    [Results] [Results] [Results] [Results] [Results]
```

**Instructions:**
1. **Write each assessment's results** under its column:
   - MBTI: Your 4-letter type (e.g., ENFJ) + brief meaning (e.g., "Extraverted, values harmony, structured")
   - VIA: Your top 5 signature strengths (e.g., Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning, Perseverance, Social Intelligence)
   - CliftonStrengths: Your top 5 talents (e.g., Strategic, Learner, Empathy, Communication, Achiever)
   - EI: Your strongest dimension (e.g., "High social awareness, developing self-regulation")
   - Holland Code: Your 3-letter code + meaning (e.g., ASE = Artistic-Social-Enterprising)

2. **Use colored highlighters to mark themes:**
   - **Color 1 (e.g., yellow):** People-oriented/social themes
   - **Color 2 (e.g., green):** Analytical/thinking themes
   - **Color 3 (e.g., blue):** Creative/innovative themes
   - **Color 4 (e.g., pink):** Leadership/influence themes
   - *(Choose colors that match YOUR results—not all students will have all 4 themes)*

3. **Draw connections** between results that relate:
   - Example: MBTI "Feeling" connects to VIA "Kindness" connects to Holland "Social"
   - Example: VIA "Curiosity" connects to CliftonStrengths "Learner" connects to Holland "Investigative"

4. **Circle your strongest theme cluster:**
   - Which color appears most frequently across assessments?
   - Where are the densest connections?

**Example Convergence:**
- Student discovers ALL five assessments emphasize people orientation:
  - MBTI: ESFJ (Extraverted-Feeling)
  - VIA: Love, Kindness, Teamwork, Social Intelligence
  - CliftonStrengths: Empathy, Developer, Harmony
  - EI: High social awareness, high relationship management
  - Holland: SEC (Social-Enterprising-Conventional)

  **Interpretation:** This student thrives working WITH people, building relationships, and creating harmony—career implications point toward HR, counseling, team leadership, or customer-facing roles.

### Step 2: Small Group Sharing & Questioning (15 minutes)

**Your Task:**
Share your map with 2-3 peers. For each person's map, the group asks probing questions:

**Questions to ask each other:**
- "I notice [pattern X] across 3 assessments. Do you see that in yourself?"
- "Your MBTI says [X] but Holland Code says [Y]—how do you interpret that contradiction?"
- "What theme surprised you? What confirmed what you already knew?"
- "If I only looked at your assessments (not knowing you), what careers would I suggest?"
- "What's NOT showing up in any assessment? Any talents or interests missing?"

**Your goal:**
Get external perspective on your results (reducing your Johari Window "Blind Spot"). Peers may see patterns you missed or question interpretations that don't match how they observe you.

**Write down:**
- 1-2 insights peers offered that you hadn't considered
- 1 question they raised that you need to explore with your mentor

## Activity 2: Interpretation Practice—Convergence vs. Contradiction (20 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Your PDP integration statement must address BOTH patterns (convergence) AND contradictions. This activity teaches you to interpret contradictions as insights, not errors.

**The Challenge:**
Analyze case study profiles to practice identifying patterns and contradictions, then apply the same thinking to your own results.

### Round 1: Case Study Analysis (10 minutes)

**Case Study A: The "Contradiction" Profile**
- MBTI: INTJ (Introverted-Intuitive-Thinking-Judging)
- VIA: Creativity, Curiosity, Love of Learning, Judgment, Appreciation of Beauty
- CliftonStrengths: Ideation, Strategic, Learner, Input, Analytical
- EI: High self-awareness, moderate-low social awareness
- Holland Code: ASE (Artistic-Social-Enterprising)

**Discussion Questions (5 minutes in pairs):**
1. What patterns do you see? (INTJ + Investigative strengths BUT Holland says Artistic-Social-Enterprising)
2. Is this actually a contradiction, or can you find a hybrid career that fits?
3. What careers would honor both the analytical introversion AND the creative-social interests?

**Possible Interpretation:**
Not contradictory—fits UX Research (Artistic design + Investigative analysis + Social user empathy + Enterprising leadership in design thinking). Or Strategic Communications (creative messaging + analytical audience research). The contradiction resolves when you find careers that blend multiple Holland types.

**Case Study B: The "Coherent" Profile**
- MBTI: ESFJ (Extraverted-Sensing-Feeling-Judging)
- VIA: Kindness, Teamwork, Fairness, Love, Social Intelligence
- CliftonStrengths: Harmony, Developer, Empathy, Responsibility, Consistency
- EI: High social awareness, high relationship management
- Holland Code: SEC (Social-Enterprising-Conventional)

**Discussion Questions (5 minutes in pairs):**
1. What is the dominant theme? (Extremely people-focused, relationship-driven, organized approach)
2. What careers fit this profile? (HR management, team coordination, nonprofit program management)
3. What might this person STRUGGLE with? (Highly competitive environments, solitary technical work, conflict-heavy roles)

### Round 2: Apply to Your Own Results (10 minutes)

**Your Task:**
Write brief answers to these questions about YOUR assessment results:

1. **Convergence:** What is the strongest pattern across your 5 assessments? (1-2 sentences)
   - *Example: "All five assessments emphasize analytical thinking and problem-solving—MBTI Thinking, VIA Judgment + Curiosity, CliftonStrengths Analytical + Strategic, high EI self-awareness, Holland Investigative."*

2. **Contradiction:** What results seem to conflict? How do you interpret that? (2-3 sentences)
   - *Example: "MBTI says ISTJ (Introverted-Conventional) but Holland Code is ASE (Artistic-Social-Enterprising). I think this reflects that I'm naturally introverted but passionate about creative work that involves people. I'll need roles with deep work time AND collaborative phases, like brand strategy or content marketing."*

3. **Career Implications:** Based on your patterns, what 2-3 career fields seem like good fits? (1 sentence)
   - *Example: "Marketing research, data-driven design, or business analytics roles that combine Investigative analysis with Artistic creativity."*

**Save these answers—you'll use them in Activity 3.**

## Activity 3: Draft Your PDP Integration Statement (30 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** This is THE key deliverable for PDP Part 1. You're drafting the 200-300 word integration statement required in your Personal Development Plan. Students who complete a strong draft today will have minimal revision work later.

**The Challenge:**
Write a 200-300 word integration statement that synthesizes all 5 assessments, identifies patterns and contradictions, and states career implications.

### Structure to Follow:

**Paragraph 1: Overview & Dominant Pattern (80-100 words)**
- *Opening sentence:* "Across all five self-assessments, a consistent pattern emerges: [state your 1-2 dominant themes]."
- *Evidence:* Provide specific examples from at least 3 assessments showing this pattern
- *Example:* "Across all five self-assessments, a consistent pattern emerges: strong people-orientation and relationship-building. My MBTI type (ENFJ) emphasizes Feeling and harmony-seeking, VIA highlights Love and Social Intelligence as signature strengths, CliftonStrengths identifies Empathy and Developer in my top 5, EI results show high social awareness and relationship management, and my Holland Code (SEC) prioritizes Social and Enterprising environments."

**Paragraph 2: Contradictions or Complexity (60-80 words)**
- *Acknowledge nuance:* "However, my results also reveal [contradiction or complexity]."
- *Interpret, don't dismiss:* Explain what this tells you about yourself
- *Example:* "However, my results also reveal complexity: while MBTI indicates Introversion, my Holland Code includes Social and Enterprising (typically extraverted). I interpret this as preferring deep one-on-one relationships over large group settings—I'm people-focused but need recharge time. This suggests careers involving meaningful client relationships rather than constant networking."

**Paragraph 3: Career Implications & Next Steps (60-80 words)**
- *Synthesize:* "These insights suggest career paths that [state requirements based on your profile]."
- *Provide examples:* Name 2-3 specific career fields or roles
- *Validation plan:* Mention how you'll test these hypotheses
- *Example:* "These insights suggest career paths that combine relationship-building with structured systems—HR management, client success roles, or organizational development. My Mentorship Meeting #2 will focus on exploring which industries (corporate, NGO, consulting) best leverage my SEC profile. I'll also seek informational interviews with professionals in these fields to test career-personality fit before committing to summer internships."

### Individual Writing Time (20 minutes)

**Your Task:**
Write your 200-300 word integration statement using the structure above. Be specific—use actual assessment results, not vague generalizations.

**Quality checklist while writing:**
- [ ] Mentions all 5 assessments by name (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, EI, Holland Code)
- [ ] Provides specific results (not "my strengths include..." but "VIA identifies Curiosity and Judgment as signature strengths...")
- [ ] Identifies 2-3 clear patterns with evidence
- [ ] Acknowledges at least 1 contradiction or complexity and interprets it
- [ ] States career implications with 2-3 specific field/role examples
- [ ] Word count: 200-300 words (check!)
- [ ] Demonstrates critical thinking about assessment validity (optional but strong: mentioning Erford's MBTI caution or Reid & Short's CliftonStrengths concerns shows sophistication)

### Peer Feedback (10 minutes)

**Your Task:**
Exchange drafts with a partner. Read their integration statement and provide feedback using this framework:

**Strengths (what works well):**
- "Your pattern about [X] is really clear—I see the evidence across 3 assessments."
- "I like how you interpreted the [contradiction] as [interpretation]—that makes sense."

**Questions/Suggestions:**
- "You mention [career X], but I don't see how that connects to [result Y]—can you explain?"
- "This feels generic in places—can you add specific assessment names/results instead of saying 'assessments show'?"
- "You're at 280 words but didn't mention Holland Code—can you fit it in?"

**Give specific, actionable feedback—not just "good job."**

## Activity 4: Mentorship Meeting #2 Preparation (10 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Mentorship Meeting #2 (happening this week or next) should focus on assessment results and career implications. Students who prepare thoughtfully get more valuable mentor guidance, which improves Mentorship Program grades (20%) and PDP quality (40%).

**The Challenge:**
Prepare 3-5 high-quality questions for your mentor about interpreting your assessment results in career context.

### Question Quality Framework

**WEAK Questions (too vague, mentor can't add value):**
- ❌ "What do you think of my results?"
- ❌ "Are these assessments accurate?"
- ❌ "What should I do with this information?"

**STRONG Questions (specific, leverage mentor's expertise):**
- ✓ "My Holland Code is ESC (Enterprising-Social-Conventional). In your industry experience, what roles combine leadership, people work, and structured systems? How does that play out day-to-day?"
- ✓ "All five assessments emphasize analytical thinking (MBTI Thinking, VIA Judgment, CliftonStrengths Analytical, Holland Investigative). But I worry analysis alone won't advance my career. What complementary skills should I develop?"
- ✓ "My VIA shows Creativity and Curiosity as top strengths, but my Holland Code is Conventional-Realistic (structured, technical). Do you see careers that need both systematic approaches AND creative problem-solving?"
- ✓ "Erford's 2025 study says MBTI has weak career validity, but I'm INTJ and it felt accurate. Should I trust type descriptions when exploring careers, or focus more on Holland Code?"

### Your Task (5 minutes):

**Write 3-5 questions for Mentorship Meeting #2:**

1. **Pattern interpretation question:**
   *Example: "My dominant pattern is [X across 3+ assessments]. In your industry, what roles heavily rely on this trait? How would someone with my profile contribute to a team?"*

2. **Contradiction resolution question:**
   *Example: "My MBTI says [X] but Holland Code says [Y]—this seems contradictory. How would you interpret this? Are there careers that honor both preferences?"*

3. **Career exploration question:**
   *Example: "Based on my [specific results], what 2-3 career paths should I explore that I might not have considered? What would a typical day look like in those roles?"*

4. **Blind spot question (external perspective):**
   *Example: "You've worked with me for [X weeks/meetings]. Do my assessment results match how you see my strengths? What am I undervaluing or overvaluing about myself?"*

5. **Development question:**
   *Example: "My assessments don't mention [skill X], but I know it's important for [career Y]. How critical is this gap? How can I develop this skill alongside my natural strengths?"*

**Submit these questions in your Pre-Meeting Preparation Form 48 hours before Meeting #2.**

### Group Share (5 minutes):

**Quick round-robin:**
Each student shares their strongest question (1 per person). Group notes patterns: Are we asking about patterns? Contradictions? Blind spots? Career fit? This helps everyone improve question quality.
