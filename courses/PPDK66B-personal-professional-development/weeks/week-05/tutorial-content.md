## Quick Review (5 minutes)

### Today's Focus
Applying self-assessment frameworks to generate career hypotheses and practicing peer feedback

### Framework Recap
- **Self-Awareness Dimensions**: Internal (values, strengths) and External (others' perceptions)
- **MBTI/Personality**: Acceptable for exploration, weak for prediction
- **VIA Character Strengths**: 24 strengths across 6 virtues; evidence-based career tool
- **CliftonStrengths**: Conceptually useful but weaker validity in student populations
- **Holland Code/RIASEC**: Modest but consistent congruence effects for career fit

---

## Main Activity: Strengths-Based Career Exploration (75 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
1. Identify convergent patterns across multiple assessment frameworks
2. Generate evidence-based career hypotheses from assessment integration
3. Provide and receive constructive peer feedback on self-assessment insights
4. Create an action plan for testing career hypotheses through experience

### Part 1: Individual Integration (20 minutes)

#### Instructions
Working individually, complete the Integration Worksheet below using your assessment results.

#### Integration Worksheet

**1. Assessment Results Summary**

Record your results from each assessment:

| Framework | Your Results |
|-----------|--------------|
| **VIA Character Strengths** (Top 5) | 1.<br>2.<br>3.<br>4.<br>5. |
| **Holland Code/RIASEC** (3-letter code) | Primary type:<br>Secondary type:<br>Tertiary type: |
| **Personality** (MBTI/16P or Big Five) | Type/Traits: |
| **Self-Awareness** (Johari Window) | Strongest quadrant:<br>Development area: |

**2. Convergence Analysis**

Look for patterns across frameworks:

*Common themes (what appears in 3+ frameworks):*
-
-
-

*Contradictions (what conflicts between frameworks):*
-
-

**3. Career Hypothesis Generation**

Based on convergent patterns, list 5-10 careers worth exploring:

| Career Direction | Which Frameworks Support This? | Initial Interest Level (1-5) |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1. | | |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. | | |
| 5. | | |
| 6. | | |
| 7. | | |
| 8. | | |

**4. Reality Check Questions**

For your top 3 career directions, answer:

*Career 1:* _______________

- What do people in this career actually do daily?
- What education/experience is required?
- Does this align with my values from Week 3?
- What's one way I could test this hypothesis (internship, project, interview)?

*Career 2:* _______________

- What do people in this career actually do daily?
- What education/experience is required?
- Does this align with my values from Week 3?
- What's one way I could test this hypothesis?

*Career 3:* _______________

- What do people in this career actually do daily?
- What education/experience is required?

### Part 2: Peer Feedback Exchange (30 minutes)

#### Purpose
Develop external self-awareness by receiving others' perspectives on your self-assessment

#### Instructions

**Step 1: Form Pairs (2 minutes)**
Partner with someone you don't usually work with—fresh perspectives are valuable.

**Step 2: Partner A Shares (10 minutes)**
- **Share (5 min):** Present your assessment results, convergent patterns, and top 3 career hypotheses
- **Partner B Listens & Questions (5 min):** Ask clarifying questions using the Feedback Guide below

**Step 3: Partner B Shares (10 minutes)**
- Same structure: 5 minutes sharing, 5 minutes feedback

**Step 4: Reflection (8 minutes)**
- Both partners individually complete the Feedback Reflection questions below

#### Feedback Guide for Listeners

**Clarifying Questions:**
- "You mentioned [strength/interest]—can you give an example of when you've demonstrated that?"
- "How do your top VIA strengths show up in your daily life?"
- "What surprised you most about your assessment results?"

**Observation Questions:**
- "Based on what I know about you, I also see [quality/strength]—does that resonate?"
- "Have you considered [career field] given your [specific strength pattern]?"
- "I notice [behavior/pattern] when we work together—how does that connect to your results?"

**Challenge Questions (use thoughtfully):**
- "Your results suggest [X], but you're planning [Y]—how do you reconcile that?"
- "What would need to be true for you to pursue [career hypothesis]?"
- "Which of your top 3 careers excites you most? What holds you back from that direction?"

#### Feedback Reflection

After receiving feedback, answer:

**1. What did your partner observe about you that you hadn't fully recognized?**

[space for response]

**2. Which career suggestion or question from your partner was most valuable? Why?**

[space for response]

**3. How did external feedback (partner's perspective) differ from your internal assessment?**

[space for response]

**4. What blind spot might you have that this conversation revealed?**

[space for response]

- Feasibility: Can I test this hypothesis this semester?

**Step 2: Design Experience Tests (15 minutes)**

Complete the Experience Testing Plan:

**Informational Interviews (identify 2-3 professionals to interview)**

| Person/Role | How I'll Find Them | Questions I'll Ask | Target Date |

## Before Next Class (10 minutes)

### Weekly Reflection Journal Entry

**Reflection Prompts:**

1. **Assessment Insights:** What was the most surprising or valuable insight from your self-assessments this week?

2. **Convergence vs. Contradiction:** Where did your assessment results converge (agree)? Where did they contradict? How do you explain the contradictions?

3. **External Self-Awareness:** How did your partner's feedback differ from your self-perception? What blind spot did you discover?

4. **Career Clarity:** Has this week's work increased or decreased your career clarity? Explain.

5. **Action Commitment:** What is ONE specific action you will take this week to test your priority career hypothesis?

### Preparation for Next Week: Job Market Research

**Required Actions:**
1. Choose one career from your top 3 hypotheses
2. Search O*NET database (onetonline.org) for that career—review job description, tasks, skills required
3. Find 2-3 job postings for entry-level positions in that career field
4. Bring notes to next tutorial: What qualifications do employers actually seek?

**Reading Preparation:**
- Next week shifts from self-discovery to market discovery: understanding industries, organizations, and roles
- You'll learn systematic job market research methods, including labor market data interpretation

### Optional Extension Activity

**For students seeking deeper exploration:**

Complete the Extended Integration Analysis:

1. **Big Five-Holland Integration:** If you have Big Five results (from 16Personalities or similar), map them to your Holland Code using the connections from lecture. Do they align?

2. **VIA-Career Mapping:** For each of your top 5 VIA strengths, identify 2-3 specific careers where that strength is a core job requirement (not just nice-to-have).

3. **Assessment Validity Research:** Choose one assessment tool you used. Find one peer-reviewed article examining its validity. Summarize: What does research say about this tool's effectiveness?

4. **Cultural Considerations:** Reflect on how your cultural background influences your assessment results or career aspirations. Are there cultural values that create tension with assessment-based career guidance?

## Tutorial Facilitator Notes

**Timing Checkpoints:**
- 0:00-0:05: Quick Review
- 0:05-0:25: Part 1 (Individual Integration)
- 0:25-0:55: Part 2 (Peer Feedback Exchange)
- 0:55-1:20: Part 3 (Action Planning)
- 1:20-1:30: Before Next Class instructions

**Key Facilitation Points:**

1. **Assessment Completion Check:** At tutorial start, verify that students have completed VIA and O*NET assessments. Have backup tablets/computers available for students who forgot.

2. **Integration Support:** During Part 1, circulate to help students identify convergent patterns. Common challenge: students see only differences, not similarities. Guide them: "Your top VIA strength is Curiosity and your Holland Code is Investigative—what's the common theme?"

3. **Peer Feedback Quality:** Before Part 2, model good feedback using the Feedback Guide. Emphasize: specific observations over generic praise, questions over advice.

4. **Action Planning Realism:** During Part 3, help students create feasible plans. Common issue: overly ambitious plans ("I'll contact 10 CEOs"). Guide toward: "Which ONE professional could you realistically reach through your network?"

5. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Vietnamese students may find peer feedback uncomfortable due to cultural norms around directness. Frame feedback as "helping each other discover strengths" rather than "pointing out problems."

**Common Student Questions:**

- **"What if my assessments all gave different results?"** → Guide them to look for higher-level patterns (e.g., all results suggest independent vs. collaborative work, even if specific strengths differ) or acknowledge that uncertainty is valuable information—which framework resonates most with lived experience?

- **"What if I don't like any of the suggested careers?"** → Assessments generate hypotheses, not mandates. Ask: What about the suggestions doesn't appeal? That negative reaction reveals preferences too. What careers DO appeal, and how do they relate to assessment patterns?

- **"Can I change my Holland Code or strengths?"** → Interests and strengths can develop, but core patterns are relatively stable in adulthood. More productive question: How can you find or create roles that leverage current patterns rather than fighting them?

- **"What if my priority career requires skills I don't have?"** → That's why Step 2 includes skill development planning. Gap identification is the first step toward gap closure. Action: identify the 2-3 most critical skills and make a development plan.

**Materials Needed:**
- Printed Integration Worksheets (one per student)
- Backup internet access for students who haven't completed assessments
- Access to O*NET database for demonstration
- Timer for peer feedback exchanges

**Assessment Criteria** (if tutorial participation is graded):
- Completion of Integration Worksheet with thoughtful analysis
- Quality of peer feedback exchange (observation by tutor)
- Specificity and feasibility of Action Planning commitments
- Completion of weekly reflection journal entry
