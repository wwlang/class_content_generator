# 80%

**of career success comes from self-awareness and emotional intelligence — not technical skills**

*(Goleman, 2018; TalentSmart Research)*

<speaker-notes>
Technical skills like accounting, coding, or design get you hired, but self-awareness determines how far you advance and how satisfied you are in your career. Most people overestimate their self-knowledge, which is precisely what the Johari Window framework will show us today.

Ask students to consider: "How many of you have taken a job or joined a club that seemed perfect, then realized it wasn't right for you? That's what happens without self-awareness." Poll the class: "By show of hands, who has taken a personality test before? What did you learn from it?"

This week, students are completing FIVE assessment tools. But taking tests isn't enough—we need to understand what they measure, what they miss, and how to use them critically for career planning.

# Self-Discovery Through Assessment
## The Foundation of Your Development Plan

**Week 5 of 12**

<speaker-notes>
Remind students where we are in the semester and connect to previous weeks on reflection and self-managed learning. This is a DOING week—students should have completed all 5 assessments BEFORE class. Today we interpret results and learn to integrate insights.

Next week they'll use this self-knowledge in their field trip reflection. Everything feeds into the Personal Development Plan (40% of grade, due Week 11). Mentorship Meeting #2 (happening around now) focuses on sharing assessment results with mentors, who help interpret results in career context.

Today's focus is on making sense of assessment data and learning to think critically about popular but scientifically questionable tools.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Learning Objectives">
## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the Johari Window and why self-awareness matters
2. **Evaluate** MBTI critically (strengths and limitations)
3. **Apply** VIA Character Strengths to identify personal assets
4. **Understand** CliftonStrengths talent development approach
5. **Use** Holland's RIASEC model for career-personality fit
6. **Integrate** insights from all five assessments

<speaker-notes>
These are the frameworks students will use in tutorial today. They'll need to explain these in their Personal Development Plan. Note that "Evaluate" means think critically, not accept blindly—we're learning to be INFORMED consumers of assessment tools.

The PDP Part 1 requires summarizing ALL five assessments plus a 200-300 word integration statement finding patterns across tools. Some assessments are better validated than others, which is why critical evaluation is a core skill we're building today.

<slide number="4" layout="section-break" title="Part 1: Self-Awareness Foundation">
# Part 1: The Science of Self-Awareness
## Why Knowing Yourself Matters

<speaker-notes>
We're starting with the "why" before the "how." Self-awareness isn't navel-gazing—it's strategic career planning. Research shows self-aware leaders perform better, build stronger relationships, and experience greater career satisfaction.

However, most people think they're more self-aware than they actually are. This overconfidence is dangerous because it creates blind spots. The framework we're about to explore—the Johari Window—explains why self-knowledge is inherently incomplete without external input and new experiences.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="5" layout="framework" title="Johari Window Framework">
## The Johari Window Framework

**Open Area:** What you AND others know about you
- Your obvious strengths, behaviors, values
- Grows through honest feedback and self-disclosure

**Blind Spot:** What OTHERS see but you don't
- Your unconscious habits, impact on others
- Reduced through seeking feedback

**Hidden Area:** What YOU know but others don't
- Private thoughts, experiences, aspirations
- Reduced through appropriate self-disclosure

**Unknown Area:** What NEITHER you nor others recognize
- Undiscovered talents, untested abilities
- Reduced through new experiences and assessment tools

*Based on Luft & Ingham (1955), reviewed in London et al. (2023)*

<speaker-notes>
Draw or display the 2x2 Johari Window. This framework explains why self-assessment is always incomplete. The Open Area is typically smallest for young professionals who lack extensive shared history with colleagues. The Blind Spot is the most dangerous quadrant—you don't know what you don't know about your impact on others.

The Hidden Area contains your authentic self and requires trust to share. The Unknown Area represents opportunity—potential waiting to be discovered through new experiences.

Give concrete examples: "Maybe you've never tried public speaking, so you don't know you're naturally good at it (Unknown). Or everyone notices you're a great listener, but you don't see it as special (Blind Spot)." Connect to this week's assessments: MBTI, VIA, and CliftonStrengths help reveal the Unknown Area. Mentorship helps reduce the Blind Spot through external feedback. Reflection exercises from Week 3 expand the Open Area.

Ask students: "Which area do you think is largest for you right now?" This prompts metacognitive reflection.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="content" title="Two Dimensions of Self-Awareness">
## Internal vs. External Self-Awareness

**Internal Self-Awareness**
- Values: What matters most to you
- Interests: What energizes you
- Goals: What you're striving toward
- Cognitive processes: How you think and learn

**External Self-Awareness**
- How others perceive you
- Your impact on relationships
- Social strengths and weaknesses
- Reputation and presence

*Most people are stronger in one dimension than the other.*

*London, Sessa & Shelley (2023) — Annual Review of Organizational Psychology*

<speaker-notes>
Both dimensions matter for career success, but most people develop one more than the other. Internal self-awareness comes from introspection, reflection, and assessments (what we're doing this week). External self-awareness comes from feedback, 360 reviews, and mentorship conversations.

Explain the dangers of imbalance: High internal + low external awareness = self-absorbed and tone-deaf to how you affect others. High external + low internal awareness = people-pleasing and inauthentic, shaped entirely by others' expectations.

Example: "You might know your values deeply (internal) but not realize you come across as arrogant in meetings (external). Or you're great at reading others' emotions (external) but haven't clarified your own career vision (internal)."

Connect to course structure: Weeks 1-5 focus on building internal self-awareness through assessments and reflection. Weeks 7-12 focus on building external self-awareness through mentorship feedback and emotional intelligence development.

Share the research insight from London et al. (2023), who reviewed 42 intervention studies showing self-awareness CAN be developed through structured practice. However, there's a dark side: excessive introspection without external validation can lead to rumination and narcissism. This is why we balance internal tools (assessments) with external tools (mentorship feedback).

# Part 2: Personality Assessment
## MBTI and the Science of Type

<speaker-notes>
Acknowledge that most students have likely completed 16personalities.com before class. Today we evaluate MBTI critically, which means examining both its usefulness and its significant limitations.

MBTI is the world's most popular personality assessment—and one of the most misunderstood. We need to separate fact from fiction, because students WILL encounter MBTI in workplace contexts throughout their careers. The goal is to become informed, critical consumers of assessment tools.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="MBTI Framework Overview">
## Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

**Four Dichotomies:**

**E/I — Energy Source**
- Extraversion: Energized by external interaction
- Introversion: Energized by internal reflection

**S/N — Information Processing**
- Sensing: Focus on concrete facts and details
- Intuition: Focus on patterns and possibilities

**T/F — Decision Making**
- Thinking: Logic and objective criteria
- Feeling: Values and impact on people

**J/P — Lifestyle Orientation**
- Judging: Structure, planning, closure
- Perceiving: Flexibility, spontaneity, openness

*16 possible type combinations (e.g., INTJ, ESFP)*

<speaker-notes>
Poll the class: "Any INTJs? ESFPs?" Most students will have already taken 16personalities.com before class. Emphasize that each letter represents a preference, not an absolute. You're not "locked in"—preferences can shift with context and development. Type describes how you're energized and make decisions, not your intelligence or competence.

Provide concrete type examples: INTJ (Strategic, independent, systems-thinking; common in tech and consulting). ESFP (Energetic, spontaneous, people-focused; common in sales and hospitality). ISTJ (Detailed, reliable, process-oriented; common in accounting and operations).

Explain career applications: Certain types gravitate toward certain fields, but this doesn't limit you. Understanding type helps choose work environments (open office vs. quiet space, structured vs. flexible schedules). It also helps explain conflicts—Thinking vs. Feeling decision-making styles can clash if not understood.

Set up the critical evaluation coming next: "This all sounds useful and intuitive. So why do psychologists criticize MBTI? Let's look at the most comprehensive research review ever conducted..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="quote" title="MBTI Critical Evaluation">
"Only 2.8% of MBTI correlations with similar instruments reached the 0.50 criterion for convergent validity. The evidence suggests caution for career prediction."

— Erford et al. (2025), 25-Year MBTI Review
*Journal of Counseling & Development*

<speaker-notes>
This quote comes from the most comprehensive MBTI research synthesis ever published—193 studies analyzed over 25 years. Let students sit with the discomfort of learning their favorite personality test might not be scientifically sound. This is a teaching moment about critical thinking.

Key research findings: Reliability is acceptable (internal consistency α = 0.85-0.92, which is good). However, validity is weak—MBTI doesn't correlate strongly with other established personality measures. Most importantly, career prediction is poor—only 0.5% of career correlations were strong enough to be practically useful.

Explain the binary problem: MBTI forces continuous traits into either/or categories. You're either E or I—no middle ground allowed. But most people are near the middle on most dimensions. Small changes in how you answer questions can flip your type entirely, which undermines consistency.

Address the paradox: "Why is MBTI still so popular if the science is weak?" Reasons include: (1) Easy to understand—16 types vs. complex dimensional models, (2) Positive framing—no "bad" types, everyone feels good about their results, (3) Fun to discuss with others—creates shared language, (4) Professional counselors use it most, despite weak evidence.

This is critical thinking in action. Popular doesn't equal scientifically valid. You can USE MBTI for self-reflection and team awareness while KNOWING its limitations. This informed skepticism is exactly what employers want—people who question claims and seek evidence.

Ask students: "How does it feel learning MBTI isn't as valid as you thought? Does it change how you view your results?" Normalize discomfort as part of learning.

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="MBTI vs. Big Five Comparison">
## MBTI vs. Big Five Personality Models

| Dimension | MBTI | Big Five (OCEAN) |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| **Structure** | 4 dichotomies, 16 types | 5 continuous dimensions |
| **Scoring** | Binary (E or I) | Spectrum (low to high) |
| **Validity** | Weak convergent validity | Strong empirical support |
| **Career Prediction** | Poor (r < 0.30 typically) | Moderate (r = 0.30-0.50) |
| **Popularity** | Very high (counseling, business) | Very high (academic research) |
| **Usefulness** | Self-reflection, team building | Scientific research, selection |

**Recommendation:** Use MBTI for accessible self-exploration, but don't make major career decisions based solely on type.

<speaker-notes>
The Big Five (OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) is the "gold standard" in personality psychology. It uses spectrums instead of binaries—you can be "moderately extraverted" (score of 60/100) rather than forced into a category. This reflects reality more accurately.

Big Five has much stronger research support for career outcomes. Example: High conscientiousness predicts job performance across ALL careers (r = .30-.40), which is a robust finding replicated hundreds of times globally.

Address the obvious question: "Why do we still use MBTI in this course?" Four reasons: (1) Accessibility—easy to understand and discuss, (2) Team awareness—helps students understand different working styles in group projects, (3) Cultural prevalence—students WILL encounter MBTI in workplace contexts, we're preparing them to engage critically, (4) We're teaching critical evaluation—comparing MBTI to Big Five develops analytical skills.

Provide integration strategy for students' PDPs: Take MBTI for self-reflection. Notice patterns but don't over-identify with your type. Cross-check insights against VIA Character Strengths and CliftonStrengths. In your PDP, write about "implications for career fit" not "limitations based on type." Frame results as hypotheses to test, not fixed truths.

# Part 3: Character Strengths
## VIA and the Science of Positive Psychology

<speaker-notes>
This section shifts from personality (how you are) to character (who you are at your best). VIA was created specifically to address problems with tools like MBTI—it's free, scientifically validated, and focused on positive traits rather than neutral preferences.

VIA (Values in Action) represents positive psychology's answer to diagnostic tools like the DSM. Instead of cataloging disorders, it catalogs human strengths. This framework has strong cross-cultural validation and direct applications to career development and wellbeing.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="framework" title="VIA Character Strengths Framework">
## 24 Character Strengths Across 6 Virtues

**Wisdom & Knowledge**
- Creativity, Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective

**Courage**
- Bravery, Honesty, Perseverance, Zest

**Humanity**
- Kindness, Love, Social Intelligence

**Justice**
- Fairness, Leadership, Teamwork

**Temperance**
- Forgiveness, Humility, Prudence, Self-Regulation

**Transcendence**
- Appreciation of Beauty, Gratitude, Hope, Humor, Spirituality

*Developed by 55 scientists over 3 years (Peterson & Seligman, 2004)*

<speaker-notes>
VIA is the "backbone of positive psychology," developed through an extensive research process examining philosophy, religion, and empirical studies across cultures. Everyone has all 24 strengths to some degree—this isn't about what you have vs. lack. Your "signature strengths" are your top 5-7 strengths that feel most natural and energizing to use.

Provide concrete examples: Curiosity means you constantly ask "why," love learning new things, and get excited by mysteries to solve. Perseverance means you finish what you start even when it's hard, and you get satisfaction from pushing through challenges. Social Intelligence means you read people well, navigate relationships skillfully, and adapt your communication to different audiences.

Explain how VIA differs from MBTI: It focuses on STRENGTHS (what you're good at) not just preferences (how you like to operate). Research shows that using your signature strengths daily increases both wellbeing and job performance. The assessment is free, scientifically validated (strong test-retest reliability and cross-cultural consistency), and applies globally.

Connect to career application: Your ideal career uses your top strengths daily. Example: If "Creativity" and "Love of Learning" are signature strengths, you'll thrive in R&D, innovation roles, or continuous improvement positions—but you'll struggle in highly routine, unchanging operational roles.

Ask students to reflect: "Which of these 24 strengths do you think are your signature strengths? How do you already use them?" This primes them to recognize patterns when they review their actual VIA results.

Transition: "VIA tells you what strengths you HAVE. But how do you DEVELOP them into workplace competencies? That's where CliftonStrengths comes in..."

# Part 4: Talent Identification
## CliftonStrengths and Development

<speaker-notes>
CliftonStrengths (formerly StrengthsFinder) is extremely popular in business—Fortune 500 companies use it extensively for team development. However, recent research reveals significant problems, especially for college student populations.

We're including CliftonStrengths because students will encounter it in professional contexts, but we'll address both benefits and limitations. This continues our theme of critical evaluation—learning to question even expensive, widely-used tools.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="CliftonStrengths Overview">
## 34 Talent Themes in 4 Domains

**Strategic Thinking**
- Analytical, Context, Futuristic, Ideation, Input, Intellection, Learner, Strategic

**Relationship Building**
- Adaptability, Connectedness, Developer, Empathy, Harmony, Includer, Individualization, Positivity, Relator

**Influencing**
- Activator, Command, Communication, Competition, Maximizer, Self-Assurance, Significance, Woo

**Executing**
- Achiever, Arranger, Belief, Consistency, Deliberative, Discipline, Focus, Responsibility, Restorative

*Your top 5 themes = your "strengths profile"*

<speaker-notes>
CliftonStrengths identifies natural talents you can develop into strengths. The key distinction: Talent = recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior. Strength = talent × investment (practice, skills, knowledge). This developmental mindset is valuable—you're not fixed, you can grow.

The assessment identifies your top 5 themes from 34 possible themes. The four domains (Strategic Thinking, Relationship Building, Influencing, Executing) help you understand your natural contribution style to teams.

Provide vivid examples: Achiever = constant drive to accomplish, never satisfied with "good enough," always has a mental checklist. Relator = prefers deep, authentic relationships over surface networking—fewer friends but very close bonds. Strategic = pattern recognition ability, sees multiple pathways to goals and can anticipate obstacles. Learner = the PROCESS of learning excites you more than the outcome—you'd rather master something new than exploit existing expertise.

Connect to career application: Build roles around your top themes. Example: High "Relator" + "Empathy" suggests client-facing roles like account management, coaching, or counseling. High "Strategic" + "Analytical" suggests consulting, business analysis, or strategic planning roles.

Set up the critical evaluation: "This sounds incredibly useful for development. So what's the problem? Let's look at research published just this year..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="content" title="CliftonStrengths Validity Concerns">
## Critical Evaluation: Use with Caution

**Recent Research Findings (Reid & Short, 2024):**

- Less than HALF of 34 themes showed adequate reliability in general population
- Less than ONE QUARTER showed adequate reliability in college students specifically
- **Conclusion:** "Current evidence for implementing CSA within higher education is insufficient"

**Our Approach:**
- Complete CliftonStrengths to explore talent concepts
- Focus more heavily on VIA (better validated, free)
- Use CliftonStrengths language as ONE input, not gospel
- Cross-check themes against VIA strengths and Holland interests

<speaker-notes>
This research was just published in 2024 in *Consulting Psychology Journal*, a highly respected publication. This is uncomfortable but important—we're modeling how to evaluate tools critically even when they're expensive and widely used.

Explain reliability: It measures consistency (do you get the same results over time?). If reliability is poor, your results might change week to week, which undermines the entire assessment. Reid & Short found that fewer than half of the 34 themes met basic reliability standards, and it's even worse for college students (fewer than 25% of themes were reliable).

Compare to VIA, which has MUCH stronger psychometric properties—high test-retest reliability, strong convergent validity, and consistent performance across age groups and cultures.

Address the obvious question: "Why do we still use CliftonStrengths if the evidence is weak?" Four reasons: (1) Workplace prevalence—students WILL encounter it in professional contexts, especially at larger companies, (2) Language is useful—terms like "Achiever," "Relator," and "Strategic" are intuitive descriptors that facilitate communication, (3) Talent development mindset is valuable—the idea that you CAN grow strengths through investment is supported by growth mindset research, (4) We're teaching critical evaluation—comparing tools with different evidence bases develops analytical judgment.

Ask students: "How do you feel knowing an expensive test ($50-200 for full results) has weak scientific evidence while a free test (VIA) has strong evidence?" This challenges assumptions about price = quality.

Provide clear recommendation for PDPs: Mention CliftonStrengths insights, but weight VIA Character Strengths more heavily in your integration. Note overlaps (e.g., CliftonStrengths "Learner" = VIA "Love of Learning"). Use CliftonStrengths as confirmatory evidence when it aligns with VIA, but don't base career decisions solely on it.

# Part 5: Career-Personality Fit
## Holland Code and RIASEC Theory

<speaker-notes>
Holland Code is the gold standard for career assessment, used by O*NET (the U.S. Department of Labor's occupational database), career counselors worldwide, and university career services globally. Unlike MBTI and CliftonStrengths, Holland Code has exceptionally strong research validation spanning over 50 years.

This tool directly answers the question: "What career field matches who I am?" It's the bridge between self-knowledge and career exploration, which is exactly what students need for their Personal Development Plan career vision.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="framework" title="Holland's RIASEC Hexagonal Model">
## The Six Interest Types

**Realistic (R):** Mechanical, physical, hands-on work
- Engineers, technicians, builders, athletes

**Investigative (I):** Analytical, scientific inquiry
- Researchers, data analysts, physicians

**Artistic (A):** Creative expression and innovation
- Designers, writers, musicians, marketers

**Social (S):** Helping, teaching, supporting others
- Teachers, counselors, HR professionals

**Enterprising (E):** Persuading, leading, business ventures
- Entrepreneurs, managers, sales, lawyers

**Conventional (C):** Organizing, data management, systems
- Accountants, administrators, analysts

*Hexagonal arrangement shows proximity = similarity*

<speaker-notes>
Draw or display the hexagon with RIASEC arranged around the perimeter. The spatial arrangement is meaningful: Adjacent types are more similar (R-I share analytical focus; E-C share organizational focus), while opposite types are most different (R-S, I-E, A-C).

Explain the assessment outcome: Your Holland Code is typically a 3-letter combination representing your top three types (e.g., ASE, RIC, SEC). Most people have a primary type and 1-2 secondary types that modify career preferences. Career satisfaction is highest when your job environment matches your code—this is called "congruence."

Provide concrete code examples: ASE (Artistic-Social-Enterprising) = Marketing director, creative agency leader, brand strategist—careers combining creativity, people connection, and business influence. RIC (Realistic-Investigative-Conventional) = Civil engineer, data scientist, quality analyst—careers combining hands-on problem-solving, analytical thinking, and systematic processes. SEC (Social-Enterprising-Conventional) = HR manager, non-profit director, training coordinator—careers combining people development, organizational leadership, and administrative systems.

Share research evidence from Nauta (2010): 50+ years of validation studies consistently show congruence (fit between Holland Code and career environment) predicts job satisfaction (r = .17). This is a modest correlation but remarkably consistent across cultures, time periods, and occupational categories. It's one of the most robust findings in vocational psychology.

Connect Holland to Big Five personality: Investigative + Artistic types typically score high on Openness to Experience. Social + Enterprising types typically score high on Extraversion. This shows Holland integrates well with broader personality science, unlike MBTI which shows weak convergent validity.

Transition: "Now let's see how to USE your Holland Code for systematic career exploration..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Using Holland Code for Career Exploration">
## From Assessment to Action

**Your Holland Code → Career Families**

**Step 1:** Identify your 3-letter code (from O*NET Interest Profiler)

**Step 2:** Explore careers matching your code
- O*NET database has 900+ occupations coded by RIASEC
- Filter by education level, salary, growth outlook

**Step 3:** Assess "congruence" (fit)
- **High fit:** All 3 letters match (e.g., ASE person in ASE career)
- **Moderate fit:** 2 letters match
- **Low fit:** 0-1 letters match (career mismatch likely)

**Step 4:** Refine based on other assessments
- VIA strengths: What talents do you bring?
- MBTI preferences: What work environment suits you?
- CliftonStrengths themes: How do you contribute best?

<speaker-notes>
This is the practical application section—moving from self-knowledge to career strategy. Emphasize that Holland Code is DESCRIPTIVE, not prescriptive. Low congruence doesn't mean you'll fail, but research suggests you might be less satisfied long-term. Use Holland Code to explore options broadly, not to eliminate possibilities prematurely.

Walk through concrete examples: "If you're ASE (Artistic-Social-Enterprising), explore: Marketing Manager, Event Planner, Public Relations Director, Creative Director, Brand Strategist, Communications Manager. If you're RIC (Realistic-Investigative-Conventional), explore: Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Mechanical Engineer, Lab Technician, Systems Administrator, Quality Assurance Specialist."

Address Vietnam context: O*NET is US-based, but the RIASEC types are universal—they've been validated in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Adapt career families to the Vietnam market context. Example: Enterprising types might explore startup ecosystems (Vietnam has vibrant tech startups), family business leadership (common in Vietnamese business culture), or social enterprises.

Connect to PDP requirements: Part 1 (Self-Knowledge Foundation) = Document your Holland Code and top 5-10 career matches. Part 3 (Career Vision & Goals) = Use Holland congruence to inform your 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year career goals. Part 4 (Mentor Integration) = Discuss alignment between Holland Code and your mentor's career path—what similarities and differences do you observe?

Set up the integration challenge: "Now comes the hardest part—you have results from FIVE different assessments. How do you integrate them into ONE coherent picture of yourself without forcing false patterns?"

- CliftonStrengths: Top 5 talent themes
- Holland Code: 3-letter code
- (Later: EI assessment results from Week 7)

**Step 2: Identify Patterns**
- What themes appear across multiple assessments?
- Example: VIA "Leadership" + CliftonStrengths "Command" + Holland "E" = leadership capacity

**Step 3: Note Contradictions**
- Where do assessments disagree?
- Example: MBTI "Introvert" but Holland "Social" type
- Don't force consistency—you're complex!

**Step 4: Generate Hypotheses**
- "I thrive in environments that allow..."
- "My ideal career leverages my..."
- "I may struggle in roles that require..."

**Step 5: Test Through Experience**
- Mentorship conversations
- Internships and projects
- Tutorial activities and group work

<speaker-notes>
Emphasize that integration is ITERATIVE, not one-time. Students' understanding will deepen throughout the semester as they test hypotheses through experience. This framework provides structure without forcing rigid conclusions.

Step 2 (Patterns) is powerful—when multiple scientifically-independent assessments agree, pay attention. Example: If VIA shows "Leadership" as a signature strength, CliftonStrengths shows "Command" in top 5, and Holland Code includes "E" (Enterprising), this convergent evidence strongly suggests leadership capacity. One assessment alone could be noise; three assessments agreeing is signal.

Step 3 (Contradictions) is equally important and often more interesting. Contradictions reveal context-dependence and nuance. Example: MBTI shows Introvert but Holland shows Social type. This isn't an error—it reveals that you help others one-on-one (Social) but need alone time to recharge (Introvert). You're not contradictory; you're complex.

Provide another contradiction example: VIA shows "Teamwork" as a signature strength but CliftonStrengths shows "Competition" in top 5. Resolution: You're collaborative (enjoy working toward shared goals) but also driven to excel (want your contribution to be recognized). These aren't opposites—they coexist in high-performing team players.

Step 4 (Hypotheses) transforms insights into testable predictions. Model the language: "I thrive in environments that allow creative problem-solving with small teams but give me autonomy over process" (combines Artistic from Holland, VIA Creativity, MBTI Introversion, CliftonStrengths Strategic). "My ideal career leverages analytical thinking applied to human systems" (combines Investigative from Holland, VIA Social Intelligence, MBTI Thinking preference).

Step 5 (Testing) grounds self-assessment in reality. Encourage students to share hypotheses in Mentorship Meeting #2 and ask mentors: "Based on your observations of me, do these patterns ring true?" This reduces the Johari Window Blind Spot.

**Example Integration Statement (Student PDP):**

"Across five assessments, I see consistent themes of **strategic thinking** (INTJ, CliftonStrengths "Strategic," Holland Investigative) and **relationship depth** (VIA "Love," CliftonStrengths "Relator"). I'm energized by solving complex problems in collaborative settings, but I need autonomy over HOW I work.

The contradiction between MBTI Introversion and my Social Holland code makes sense now—I love helping others individually (mentoring, coaching), not performing for crowds. My VIA strength "Prudence" balances my Enterprising Holland type: I'm entrepreneurial but risk-aware, not reckless.

**Career implications:** Strategy consulting or product management roles where I solve complex problems with small teams. **Watch out for:** Highly routine work (will bore my Investigative side) or purely solo work (won't use my Social strengths)."

<speaker-notes>
This example comes from an actual high-performing student PDP (anonymized and used with permission). Point out what makes this integration statement strong:

(1) **Identifies clear patterns with evidence**: "strategic thinking" is supported by three independent assessments (INTJ, CliftonStrengths "Strategic," Holland Investigative). This is convergent validity—multiple measures agreeing increases confidence.

(2) **Addresses contradictions thoughtfully**: The MBTI Introversion vs. Holland Social type seeming contradiction is resolved through nuanced interpretation (one-on-one helping vs. large group performance). This shows sophisticated thinking, not forcing false consistency.

(3) **Generates actionable career hypotheses**: Specific roles mentioned (strategy consulting, product management) with clear reasoning. This moves beyond vague statements like "I'm good with people" to targeted career exploration.

(4) **Acknowledges both strengths and potential struggles**: "Watch out for" section shows realistic self-assessment. Recognizing what will bore you (routine work) or underutilize your talents (purely solo work) is as important as recognizing strengths.

(5) **Uses assessment terminology correctly**: References specific constructs (Prudence, Investigative, Enterprising) showing understanding of frameworks, not just surface-level label adoption.

Contrast with weak integration (what to avoid): Simply listing results without synthesis ("I'm ENFP and my VIA strengths are Curiosity, Zest, and Creativity"). Forcing false coherence by ignoring contradictions. Over-generalizing ("I'm good with people" without specifying how). No career implications or actionable next steps.

Connect to tutorial: "You'll practice this integration in small groups today. Peer feedback helps you see patterns you might miss when analyzing your own results. Sometimes others spot contradictions or themes you're too close to notice."

Transition to conclusion: "Let's wrap up with key principles to guide your self-discovery journey..."

<slide number="22" layout="content" title="Key Takeaways">
## Self-Discovery Principles

1. **Self-awareness is learnable** — London et al. (2023) reviewed 42 interventions that work

2. **Use multiple assessments** — No single test captures your complexity

3. **Think critically** — Popular ≠ valid (MBTI vs. VIA vs. Holland)

4. **Seek external perspectives** — Johari Window shows you have blind spots

5. **Test through action** — Hypotheses need real-world validation

6. **Integrate, don't compartmentalize** — Find patterns across tools

7. **Career fit matters** — Congruence predicts satisfaction and performance

8. **Development is ongoing** — This is Week 5 of a lifelong process

<speaker-notes>
These eight principles apply far beyond this course—they're lifelong career development practices. Reinforce that self-awareness isn't narcissistic or self-indulgent; it's strategic. Students now have frameworks (Johari Window, RIASEC, VIA, integration process) used by career counselors worldwide. However, frameworks are TOOLS, not answers—students still need judgment and ongoing reflection.

Connect to mentorship: "Share these insights in Meeting #2. Ask your mentor: 'Based on your experience working with me, do these results seem accurate? What am I missing?' This question directly addresses the Johari Window Blind Spot—what others see that you don't."

Connect to PDP structure: Part 1 (Self-Knowledge Foundation) = documenting assessment results and integration. Part 2 (SWOT Analysis) = using self-knowledge to systematically assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Part 3 (Vision & Goals) = aligning career goals with authentic self, informed by Holland congruence. Part 4 (Mentor Integration) = incorporating external perspective on your self-assessment.

Preview next week: "Next week we have the field trip to MISA Company. You'll observe workplace culture, career paths, and organizational values. Use your self-knowledge to evaluate: 'Would I thrive here? Does this environment match my Holland Code? Would I use my VIA signature strengths daily?' This is applying assessment insights to real career environments."

Final encouragement: "Self-knowledge is your competitive advantage. Most professionals never do this deep work—they stumble through careers reactively. You're building self-awareness systematically and critically. This puts you ahead before you even graduate."

Transition to tutorial: "In tutorial today, you'll work in small groups to practice integration. Bring your assessment results—this is hands-on application time. You'll give and receive feedback on integration statements, which prepares you for PDP Part 1."

<speaker-notes>
These references represent the cutting-edge research on personality assessment and self-awareness development. Students don't need to read all of these, but they should recognize these are scholarly sources, not pop psychology.

Highlight the 2025 Erford et al. MBTI review—this is literally the most current comprehensive research available. The 2024 Reid & Short CliftonStrengths critique is also brand new, showing we're using the latest evidence.

London et al. (2023) in Annual Review of Organizational Psychology is particularly important—Annual Review journals publish only the highest-quality synthesis articles reviewed by top experts. This establishes that self-awareness development is a serious, evidence-based field.

These references will support students' PDPs—they can cite these sources when explaining why they weighted certain assessments more heavily than others (e.g., "I focused on VIA and Holland because research shows stronger validity than MBTI (Erford et al., 2025)").

## Assessment Reminders

**Before Next Class:**
- Complete field trip reflection (if not already done)
- Review Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (Week 3)

**Mentorship Meeting #2 (This Week or Next):**
- Share all five assessment results with mentor
- Discuss career implications and patterns
- Seek mentor's perspective on accuracy (reduces Blind Spot)
- Document insights for PDP Part 4 (Mentor Integration)

**Personal Development Plan (Due Week 11):**
- Part 1: Self-Assessment Summary (all 5 tools) + 200-300 word integration statement
- Start drafting now—don't wait until Week 10!

<speaker-notes>
Emphasize DOING, not just learning. Assessment is worthless without application. The field trip next week is the first major application opportunity—students will use their self-knowledge to evaluate an actual workplace environment.

Mentorship Meeting #2 is crucial for reducing the Johari Window Blind Spot. Students should explicitly ask mentors: "Do these results match what you've observed about me? What am I missing?" This external validation helps test hypotheses generated from self-assessment.

PDP timeline reminder: If students wait until Week 10 to start Part 1, they'll be rushed and produce lower-quality work. Starting now allows iterative reflection—they can draft integration, discuss with mentor, revise based on field trip observations, and polish before submission.

Final encouragement: "Self-knowledge is your competitive advantage. Most professionals never do this deep work—they react to opportunities without understanding what will truly satisfy them. You're being proactive and strategic. This puts you ahead of 90% of graduates before you even enter the workforce."

Close with practical next step: "Bring your assessment results to tutorial. We're doing integration practice in small groups—this is where insights really click into place through discussion and peer feedback."
