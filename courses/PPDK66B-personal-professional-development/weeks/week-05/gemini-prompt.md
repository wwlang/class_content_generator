# Part 1

## The Science of Self-Awareness

---

### Slide 7 (Layout: framework)

## Two Dimensions of Self-Awareness

**Internal Self-Awareness**
Understanding your own:
- Values and beliefs
- Interests and passions
- Goals and aspirations
- Cognitive patterns and decision-making styles
- Emotional responses

**External Self-Awareness**
Understanding how others perceive your:
- Communication style
- Interpersonal behaviors
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Impact on teams and relationships

*(London, Sessa, & Shelley, 2023)*

---

### Slide 8 (Layout: framework)

## The Johari Window

| | **Known to Self** | **Unknown to Self** |
|---|---|---|
| **Known to Others** | **OPEN AREA**<br>Public knowledge | **BLIND SPOT**<br>Others see it, you don't |
| **Unknown to Others** | **HIDDEN AREA**<br>Private knowledge | **UNKNOWN AREA**<br>Undiscovered potential |

**Career development goal:** Expand the Open Area

*(Luft & Ingham, 1955)*

---

### Slide 9 (Layout: content)

## The Self-Other Knowledge Asymmetry

**Research finding:** Young adults have biased views of their abilities

**Study of 448 adolescents found:**
- **Open Area:** Numerical intelligence - self and others agree
- **Blind Spot:** Verbal intelligence - others rate students higher than they rate themselves
- **Hidden Area:** Intrapersonal competence - students know this better than observers
- **Unknown Area:** Spatial ability - neither self nor others accurately predict performance

**Implication:** Professional assessment is essential, not optional

*(Neubauer et al., 2018)*

---

### Slide 10 (Layout: content)

## How to Develop Self-Awareness

| Process | Definition | Career Outcome |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Reflection** | Continuous self-learning from experience | Adaptive development |
| **Rumination** | Threat-motivated repetitive thinking | Anxiety, avoidance ❌ |
| **Metacognition** | Awareness of thought patterns | Strategic thinking |
| **Mindfulness** | Present-moment awareness without judgment | Emotional regulation |

**Key insight:** Reflection and metacognition improve self-awareness; rumination undermines it

*(London et al., 2023)*

---

### Slide 11 (Layout: content)

## Warning: The Dark Side of Introspection

**Excessive self-focus can lead to:**
- Narcissistic patterns - overestimating uniqueness and importance
- Paralysis by analysis - unable to make decisions
- Self-absorption - reduced empathy for others
- Rumination loops - dwelling on problems without action

**Balance needed:**
- Self-awareness ≠ self-obsession
- Combine internal reflection with external feedback
- Move from insight to action (don't stop at understanding)

*(London et al., 2023)*

---

### Slide 12 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 2

## Personality & Type

**MBTI/16 Personalities Framework**

---

### Slide 13 (Layout: content)

## What is Personality Type?

**Personality type theory** suggests people have:
- Innate preferences (not learned behaviors)
- Consistent patterns across situations
- Categorical differences (types, not just traits)

**Most popular framework:** Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
- Based on Carl Jung's psychological types (1921)
- Developed by Myers & Briggs (1940s-1960s)
- 16 types based on 4 dichotomies
- Most widely used personality assessment in professional contexts

**Free alternative:** 16Personalities.com (MBTI-inspired)

---

### Slide 14 (Layout: framework)

## The Four MBTI Dichotomies

| Dichotomy | Preference | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Energy** | **E**xtraversion vs. **I**ntroversion | Where you direct energy: outer world vs. inner world |
| **Information** | **S**ensing vs. I**n**tuition | How you take in information: concrete facts vs. patterns/possibilities |
| **Decisions** | **T**hinking vs. **F**eeling | How you make decisions: logic/analysis vs. values/impact on people |
| **Lifestyle** | **J**udging vs. **P**erceiving | How you approach life: structure/planning vs. flexibility/spontaneity |

**Combination creates 16 types:** INTJ, ESFP, ENFP, ISTJ, etc.

**Example:** INTJ = Introversion + Intuition + Thinking + Judging

---

### Slide 15 (Layout: content)

## Example: The INTJ Profile

**INTJ = "Architect" or "Mastermind"**

**Preferences:**
- **I**ntroversion - Energized by solitary analysis
- I**n**tuition - Focuses on patterns, theories, future possibilities
- **T**hinking - Decisions based on logic and objective criteria
- **J**udging - Prefers structure, planning, and closure

**Strengths:** Strategic thinking, independent, innovative, decisive
**Challenges:** May appear aloof, impatient with inefficiency, perfectionist
**Career fit:** Strategy consultant, engineer, research scientist, analyst

**Famous INTJs:** Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jane Austen

---

### Slide 16 (Layout: content)

## The Evidence Question: Is MBTI Valid?

**2025 Comprehensive Review** analyzed 193 studies (1999-2024):

**✓ What MBTI does well:**
- Internal consistency: α = 0.845-0.921 (good reliability)
- Stable across time (test-retest reliability)
- Popular - most used assessment in career counseling

**❌ Concerns about validity:**
- Weak convergent validity: Only 2.8% of correlations with other personality measures reached meaningful levels (r ≥ 0.50)
- Poor predictive validity for career outcomes: Only 0.5% of career-related correlations reached r ≥ 0.50
- Binary typing problem: Forces continuous traits into either/or categories

*(Erford et al., 2025)*

---

### Slide 17 (Layout: content)

## How to Use MBTI Results Wisely

**DO:**
- Explore preferences and patterns in your behavior
- Use as conversation starter with mentor or peers
- Consider how type preferences affect teamwork
- Recognize strengths associated with your type

**DON'T:**
- Make major career decisions based solely on type
- Use type as excuse ("I'm an introvert so I can't lead")
- Stereotype others based on their type
- Assume type is fixed and unchangeable

**Remember:** MBTI measures *preferences*, not *abilities*

You can develop skills outside your natural preferences!

---

### Slide 18 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 3

## Strengths & Talents

**VIA Character Strengths & CliftonStrengths**

---

### Slide 19 (Layout: content)

## VIA Character Strengths: The Science

**VIA = Values in Action**

Developed by 55 psychologists over 3 years (2001-2004), reviewed:
- Philosophy and religious texts across cultures
- Psychological research on virtues
- Cross-cultural universals in valued character traits

**Result:** 24 character strengths organized into 6 virtues

**Why it matters:**
- Using signature strengths daily → higher life satisfaction
- Strengths-based interventions improve well-being
- Free validated assessment: www.viacharacter.org

*(Peterson & Seligman, 2004)*

---

### Slide 20 (Layout: framework)

## The 24 VIA Character Strengths

| Virtue | Character Strengths |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Wisdom** | Creativity • Curiosity • Judgment • Love of Learning • Perspective |
| **Courage** | Bravery • Perseverance • Honesty • Zest |
| **Humanity** | Love • Kindness • Social Intelligence |
| **Justice** | Teamwork • Fairness • Leadership |
| **Temperance** | Forgiveness • Humility • Prudence • Self-Regulation |
| **Transcendence** | Appreciation of Beauty • Gratitude • Hope • Humor • Spirituality |

**Your "Signature Strengths" = Top 5-7 strengths**

These are the strengths that:
- Feel authentic and natural to you
- Energize you when you use them
- You actively seek opportunities to express

---

### Slide 21 (Layout: content)

## Strengths-Based Career Counseling (SBCC)

**Research study:** VIA-based career intervention with job seekers

**4-Session Model:**
1. **Strengths Identification** - Complete VIA, identify top 5
2. **Strengths Exploration** - Discuss how strengths show up in life
3. **Goal-Setting** - Set career goals aligned with strengths
4. **Application** - Create action plans using strengths

**Results at 3-month follow-up:**
- **SBCC group:** 80% employment rate
- **Control group:** 60% employment rate
- **Self-esteem:** Significant gains only in SBCC group

*(Littman-Ovadia et al., 2014)*

---

### Slide 22 (Layout: content)

## CliftonStrengths: Talent Themes

**Different from VIA:** Focuses on talents (natural patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving) rather than moral character

**34 Talent Themes** across 4 domains:
- **Executing:** Getting things done (Achiever, Discipline, Focus, Responsibility)
- **Influencing:** Taking charge and speaking up (Command, Communication, Competition)
- **Relationship Building:** Connecting with others (Empathy, Harmony, Relator)
- **Strategic Thinking:** Absorbing and analyzing information (Analytical, Learner, Strategic)

**Philosophy:** Invest in developing your top talents into strengths, rather than fixing weaknesses

*(Gallup/CliftonStrengths)*

---

### Slide 23 (Layout: content)

## A Note on Psychometric Validity

**Recent research caution (Reid & Short, 2024):**

Study examined CliftonStrengths reliability in college students:
- Less than half of 34 themes showed adequate internal consistency (α ≥ 0.70)
- Only 8 of 34 themes showed adequate reliability in college student samples
- Authors conclude: "Evidence for implementing CSA in higher education is insufficient"

**Our approach:**
- Use CliftonStrengths conceptually to explore talents
- Rely more heavily on VIA (better validated, free)
- Teach students to critically evaluate assessment claims

**Key lesson:** Popular ≠ Valid. Always examine the evidence.

---

### Slide 24 (Layout: section-break)

# Part 4

## Career-Personality Fit

**Holland Code (RIASEC) Theory**

---

### Slide 25 (Layout: content)

## Holland's Theory of Vocational Personalities

**Core premise:** Career satisfaction results from alignment between:
1. **Person:** Your interests, abilities, values
2. **Environment:** The demands and culture of the work setting

**RIASEC Model:** Six personality types and corresponding work environments

**Career development goal:** Find "congruence" (good fit)

**Most widely used theory in career counseling** - 50+ years of research

*(Holland, 1959-1997; Nauta, 2010)*

---

### Slide 26 (Layout: framework)

## The Six RIASEC Types

| Type | Personality | Preferred Work | Example Careers |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **R**ealistic | Practical, hands-on, mechanical | Working with tools, machines, objects | Engineer, mechanic, pilot |
| **I**nvestigative | Analytical, curious, intellectual | Research, problem-solving, ideas | Scientist, analyst, programmer |
| **A**rtistic | Creative, expressive, original | Innovation, self-expression, aesthetics | Designer, writer, musician |
| **S**ocial | Helpful, cooperative, empathetic | Teaching, helping, serving others | Teacher, counselor, nurse |
| **E**nterprising | Persuasive, ambitious, leader | Influencing, selling, leading | Manager, entrepreneur, lawyer |
| **C**onventional | Organized, detail-oriented, structured | Data, systems, procedures | Accountant, administrator, analyst |

**Your Holland Code = Top 3 types** (e.g., ASE, IEC, RIC)

---

### Slide 27 (Layout: framework)

## The RIASEC Hexagonal Model

```
        R
      /   \
    C       I
    |       |
    E       A
      \   /
        S
```

**Adjacency = Similarity**
- Adjacent types (e.g., R-I, A-S) are more compatible
- Opposite types (e.g., R-S, I-E) are most different
- Your Holland Code predicts career compatibility

**Example:** RIC (Realistic-Investigative-Conventional)
- Adjacent types = consistent, focused interests
- Engineering or data science likely good fit

---

### Slide 28 (Layout: content)

## Does Congruence Predict Satisfaction?

**Meta-analytic evidence:**

Person-environment congruence correlates with:
- Job satisfaction: **r = .17** (Tsabari et al., 2005)
- Performance: **r = .15** (Tranberg et al., 1993)
- Stability: **r = .10** (Assouline & Meir, 1987)

**Interpretation:**
- Modest but consistent effects
- Not deterministic - other factors matter (salary, manager, life stage)
- BUT: Persistent misalignment predicts burnout and turnover
- Better to be "in the ballpark" than completely misaligned

*(Meta-analyses reviewed in Nauta, 2010)*

---

### Slide 29 (Layout: content)

## Using Holland Code for Career Exploration

**Step 1:** Complete O*NET Interest Profiler (free)
- www.onetonline.org → Interest Profiler
- 60 questions, ~10 minutes
- Receive your 3-letter Holland Code

**Step 2:** Explore matching careers

### Slide 30 (Layout: section-break)

# Integration

## Synthesizing Multiple Assessments

---

### Slide 31 (Layout: content)

## Why Five Different Assessments?

Each measures a different facet of self-understanding:

| Assessment | What It Measures | Career Application |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **MBTI/16P** | Personality preferences | Work style, team role, environment fit |
| **VIA** | Character strengths | Values alignment, source of meaning |
| **CliftonStrengths** | Natural talents | Where you excel most naturally |
| **Holland Code** | Vocational interests | Career field fit, tasks you enjoy |
| **EI** (Week 7) | Emotional intelligence | Leadership, relationships, self-management |

**Together:** Comprehensive self-portrait for career planning

---

### Slide 32 (Layout: content)

## Integration Strategy: Look for Patterns

**Ask yourself:**

**Confirming patterns:**
- What themes appear across multiple assessments?
- Which results feel most accurate and energizing?
- Where do assessments point to similar career directions?

**Contradictions:**
- Where do results seem to conflict?
- Which conflicts are surface-level vs. fundamental?
- Do contradictions suggest versatility or internal conflict?

**Gaps:**
- What aspects of yourself are NOT captured by these assessments?
- What do you know about yourself that tests didn't reveal?
- What feedback from others contradicts your self-assessments?

---

### Slide 33 (Layout: framework)

## Sample Integration: "Sarah's Profile"

**MBTI:** ENFP (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving)
**VIA Top 5:** Creativity, Curiosity, Social Intelligence, Zest, Kindness
**CliftonStrengths Top 5:** Ideation, Strategic, Learner, Positivity, Woo
**Holland Code:** AES (Artistic, Enterprising, Social)

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Strong creative and people orientation across all assessments
- Values innovation, learning, and helping others
- Energized by variety and interpersonal interaction

**Career Alignment:**
✓ Marketing strategist for social impact organizations
✓ Innovation consultant for nonprofits
✓ Learning & development leader
✗ Accounting, routine administration, solo technical work

---

### Slide 34 (Layout: content)

## Your PDP Integration Statement

**Part 1 of Personal Development Plan requires:**

**200-300 word Integration Statement** addressing:
1. What consistent themes emerge across all 5 assessments?
2. How do these assessments collectively inform your career direction?
3. Where do you see alignments vs. contradictions?
4. What do these results confirm or challenge about your self-perception?
5. How does this integrated self-understanding shape your 1-3-5 year goals?

**This is worth 20% of your PDP grade** - invest time in thoughtful synthesis

---

### Slide 35 (Layout: content)

## From Self-Knowledge to Career Strategy

**Self-assessment answers:** "Who am I?"

**Career planning answers:** "Where am I going?"

**Development plan answers:** "How will I get there?"

**Your PDP synthesizes all three:**
- Self-assessment insights (Part 1) →
- SWOT analysis & skills gaps (Part 2) →
- Vision & SMART goals (Part 3) →
- Action timeline & accountability (Part 5)

**Assessments are the foundation, not the destination.**

---

### Slide 37 (Layout: content)

## Key Takeaways

**1. Self-awareness is rare but developable** - Most people overestimate their self-knowledge; validated assessments provide objective insights

**2. Multiple lenses provide richer understanding** - MBTI (personality), VIA (character), CliftonStrengths (talents), Holland (interests) each capture different aspects

**3. Validity matters** - Popular assessments aren't always scientifically sound; evaluate evidence critically

**4. Person-environment fit predicts satisfaction** - Career success requires alignment between who you are and what your work demands

**5. Integration is key** - Look for patterns across assessments; synthesize into coherent self-understanding

**6. Assessment is the beginning, not the end** - Use insights to inform action, not as excuse for inaction

---

### Slide 38 (Layout: content)
