// Week 5: Self-Discovery Through Assessment
// Questions: 12

$CATEGORY: PPDK66B - Week 5

::Self-Awareness Dimensions::According to London, Sessa, and Shelley (2023), what are the two dimensions of self-awareness?{
=Internal self-awareness (knowing your values, strengths, goals) and external self-awareness (understanding how others perceive you) #Correct! London et al. (2023) establish that self-awareness has two independent dimensions\: internal self-awareness involves clarity about your own values, passions, goals, strengths, and thought patterns, while external self-awareness involves understanding how others perceive you and your impact on social interactions.
~Cognitive self-awareness (thinking patterns) and emotional self-awareness (feeling patterns) #Incorrect. While thinking and feeling are important aspects of self-knowledge, London et al.'s framework specifically distinguishes internal (self-knowledge) from external (others' perceptions) dimensions, not cognitive vs. emotional.
~Personal self-awareness (private identity) and professional self-awareness (work identity) #Incorrect. The two dimensions are internal and external self-awareness, not personal vs. professional. Both internal and external awareness apply across personal and professional contexts.
~Self-knowledge (what you know) and self-regulation (how you control behavior) #Incorrect. Self-regulation is distinct from self-awareness. London et al.'s framework focuses on two awareness dimensions (internal and external), not knowledge vs. regulation.
####London et al. (2023) establish that self-awareness has two independent dimensions that are only weakly correlated. <b>Internal self-awareness</b> is your private self-knowledge—what you care about, what you're good at, how you think. <b>External self-awareness</b> is your social self-knowledge—how others see you, your impact on teams, your reputation. Complete self-awareness requires developing both dimensions simultaneously through both self-assessment (internal) and feedback-seeking (external). See Week 5 slides 5-6.}

::Self-Awareness Development Processes::A student repeatedly thinks "Why am I so bad at presentations? Why can't I be like others?" without taking action to improve. According to London et al. (2023), this is an example of which self-awareness process?{
~Reflection—structured self-examination for learning #Incorrect. Reflection involves structured self-examination with learning intent, asking 'What can I learn?' This example shows repetitive negative thinking without resolution, which is rumination, not reflection.
=Rumination—threat-focused repetitive negative thinking #Correct! London et al. (2023) distinguish rumination from productive reflection. Rumination involves repetitive, threat-focused negative thinking without resolution or action, which predicts anxiety and depression. The key difference is that rumination asks 'What's wrong with me?' while reflection asks 'What can I learn?'
~Metacognition—awareness of thinking patterns #Incorrect. Metacognition is thinking about thinking processes—noticing your problem-solving strategies and cognitive patterns. The example shows rumination\: repetitive negative thinking focused on deficits without productive resolution.
~Mindfulness—present-moment non-judgmental awareness #Incorrect. Mindfulness involves present-moment awareness without judgment. The example describes repetitive negative self-judgment focused on past performance, which is rumination, not mindfulness.
####London et al. (2023) identify four learning processes for self-awareness\: (1) <b>Reflection</b> (structured self-examination with learning intent—productive), (2) <b>Rumination</b> (repetitive, threat-focused negative thinking—harmful), (3) <b>Metacognition</b> (awareness of thought patterns), and (4) <b>Mindfulness</b> (present-moment awareness without judgment). For career development, prioritize reflection and metacognition while avoiding rumination. When you catch yourself in a negative spiral asking "What's wrong with me?", that's rumination—shift to structured reflection asking "What can I learn?" See Week 5 slide 7.}

::Johari Window Application::In the Johari Window framework, which quadrant would contain a student's unconscious habit of interrupting others during group discussions—something team members notice but the student is unaware of?{
~Open Area (known to self and others) #Incorrect. The Open Area contains what both you and others know. An unconscious habit the student is unaware of would not be in the Open Area.
=Blind Spot (unknown to self, known to others) #Correct! The Blind Spot quadrant contains what others observe about you but you don't recognize in yourself. An unconscious interrupting habit that team members notice but the student is unaware of fits this category. Neubauer et al. (2018) found that young people systematically have blind spots about their own abilities. The Blind Spot shrinks through seeking and receiving feedback from others.
~Hidden Area (known to self, unknown to others) #Incorrect. The Hidden Area contains what you know but choose not to share with others. An unconscious habit the student is unaware of cannot be in the Hidden Area since it's not known to the student.
~Unknown Area (unknown to both self and others) #Incorrect. The Unknown Area contains what neither you nor others recognize. Since team members have noticed the interrupting habit, it's not in the Unknown Area—it's in the Blind Spot (others know, you don't).
####The <b>Johari Window</b> maps self-knowledge across four quadrants based on what's known to self and others. <b>Open Area</b> (both know), <b>Blind Spot</b> (others know, you don't), <b>Hidden Area</b> (you know, others don't), <b>Unknown Area</b> (neither knows). Career development expands the Open Area by shrinking the other three\: feedback reduces Blind Spot, self-disclosure reduces Hidden Area, and new experiences reduce Unknown Area. This model explains why we need both self-assessment (for Hidden/Unknown) and peer feedback (for Blind Spot). See Week 5 slide 6.}

::MBTI Structure::How many dichotomies does the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assess, and what is the resulting number of personality types?{
=4 dichotomies, resulting in 16 personality types #Correct! MBTI assesses four dichotomies\: Extraversion-Introversion (energy direction), Sensing-Intuition (information gathering), Thinking-Feeling (decision making), and Judging-Perceiving (lifestyle orientation). All combinations of these four dichotomies (2^4) produce 16 personality types such as INTJ, ESFP, and ENFP.
~5 dichotomies, resulting in 32 personality types #Incorrect. MBTI has 4 dichotomies, not 5. The four dichotomies (E-I, S-N, T-F, J-P) combine to produce 16 personality types.
~3 dichotomies, resulting in 8 personality types #Incorrect. MBTI assesses 4 dichotomies (not 3), which combine to produce 16 personality types (not 8).
~6 dichotomies, resulting in 24 personality types #Incorrect. MBTI has 4 dichotomies producing 16 types. Note that Big Five personality model has 5 dimensions (not dichotomies), which is a different framework.
####MBTI assesses personality across <b>four dichotomies</b>\: (1) <b>Extraversion-Introversion</b> (energy direction), (2) <b>Sensing-Intuition</b> (information gathering style—details vs. patterns), (3) <b>Thinking-Feeling</b> (decision-making approach—logic vs. values), (4) <b>Judging-Perceiving</b> (lifestyle orientation—structure vs. flexibility). All combinations produce <b>16 personality types</b>. Erford et al. (2025) note that the binary typing approach forces continuous traits into dichotomies with no middle ground, which is a key criticism affecting validity. See Week 5 slide 10.}

::MBTI Psychometric Validity::According to Erford et al.'s (2025) 25-year psychometric synthesis of 193 studies, what was the key finding regarding MBTI's validity for career prediction?{
~MBTI showed excellent validity with most correlations exceeding 0.70 with career success #Incorrect. Erford et al. (2025) found weak validity for career prediction, not excellent validity. Only 0.5% of correlations with career measures reached meaningful levels.
=Only 0.5% of correlations with career measures reached the meaningful threshold (r ≥ 0.50) #Correct! Erford et al. (2025) found that while MBTI demonstrates acceptable internal consistency (reliability), its validity for career prediction is weak. Only 0.5% of correlations with career-related measures reached the r ≥ 0.50 threshold considered meaningful. This indicates MBTI poorly predicts career outcomes.
~MBTI perfectly predicted career satisfaction in 80% of cases studied #Incorrect. MBTI did not show perfect or near-perfect career prediction. Only 0.5% of correlations reached meaningful levels, indicating very weak predictive validity.
~MBTI was more valid than the Big Five for predicting job performance #Incorrect. Research suggests Big Five has stronger validity than MBTI. Erford et al. found MBTI's convergent validity with Big Five was mixed, and career prediction was very weak.
####Erford et al.'s (2025) comprehensive synthesis of 193 studies (1999-2024) found <b>mixed psychometric evidence</b> for MBTI. <b>Reliability</b> is acceptable—internal consistency ranges from 0.845 to 0.921. However, <b>validity</b> is problematic\: only <b>2.8% of correlations</b> with similar personality measures reached meaningful levels, and only <b>0.5% of correlations with career measures</b> reached r ≥ 0.50. The fundamental problem is <b>binary typing</b>\: MBTI forces continuous traits into dichotomies without middle ground, losing information and reducing validity. Use MBTI for starting conversations, not making career predictions. See Week 5 slides 11-12.}

::MBTI Appropriate Application::Based on the research evidence presented in lecture, which of the following represents an appropriate use of MBTI in career development?{
~Using MBTI results to make hiring decisions for job candidates #Incorrect. Using MBTI for hiring decisions is both discriminatory and invalid given the weak evidence for predicting job performance. This is an inappropriate use.
=Starting self-reflection conversations about work preferences and exploring career fields tentatively #Correct! Given MBTI's mixed psychometric evidence, appropriate uses include starting conversations about preferences, building team awareness of diverse approaches, and tentatively exploring career fields aligned with preferences—but as hypotheses to test, not definitive answers. The key principle\: use MBTI as one input among many, validated through actual experience.
~Limiting career exploration based on type (e.g., 'I'm an introvert so I can't do sales') #Incorrect. Limiting exploration based on type descriptions is inappropriate. Personality preferences don't determine capability—many successful salespeople are introverts. Assessment results should expand exploration, not limit it.
~Predicting job performance with confidence based solely on personality type #Incorrect. Erford et al. (2025) found weak empirical support for MBTI predicting career outcomes. Using it to predict performance with confidence is inappropriate given the evidence.
####Given mixed evidence, <b>appropriate MBTI uses</b>\: (1) Starting conversations about work preferences, (2) Building team awareness of diverse approaches, (3) Tentatively exploring career fields (as hypotheses to test). <b>Inappropriate uses</b>\: (1) Making hiring decisions (discriminatory and invalid), (2) Limiting exploration ("I can't do X because of my type"), (3) Predicting performance (weak empirical support), (4) Assuming type is fixed and unchangeable. <b>Key principle</b>\: Use MBTI as one input among many; validate with other assessments and actual experiences. Assessment informs decisions; experience validates them. See Week 5 slide 13.}

::VIA Character Strengths Framework::The VIA Character Strengths framework, developed by Peterson and Seligman (2004), consists of how many character strengths organized under how many universal virtues?{
=24 character strengths organized under 6 universal virtues #Correct! Peterson and Seligman's VIA framework identifies 24 character strengths organized under 6 universal virtues\: Wisdom & Knowledge, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, and Transcendence. The framework was developed over three years by 55 scientists who reviewed philosophical traditions, religious texts, and psychological research to identify character strengths valued across cultures and history.
~34 character strengths organized under 4 universal virtues #Incorrect. You may be thinking of CliftonStrengths, which has 34 talent themes (though not organized under virtues). VIA has 24 character strengths under 6 virtues.
~16 character strengths organized under 5 universal virtues #Incorrect. VIA has 24 character strengths (not 16) organized under 6 universal virtues (not 5).
~20 character strengths organized under 8 universal virtues #Incorrect. VIA has 24 character strengths organized under 6 universal virtues (Wisdom, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, Transcendence).
####The <b>VIA framework</b> emerged from positive psychology's effort to create a scientific classification of human strengths—"the backbone of positive psychology." The <b>6 universal virtues</b> are\: (1) <b>Wisdom & Knowledge</b> (cognitive strengths like curiosity, judgment), (2) <b>Courage</b> (emotional strengths like perseverance, honesty), (3) <b>Humanity</b> (interpersonal strengths like kindness, love), (4) <b>Justice</b> (civic strengths like teamwork, leadership), (5) <b>Temperance</b> (strengths protecting against excess like self-regulation, humility), (6) <b>Transcendence</b> (strengths connecting to larger meaning like gratitude, hope). All <b>24 strengths</b> are positive—VIA focuses on what's right about people, not what's wrong. See Week 5 slide 15.}

::Strengths-Based Career Counseling Evidence::In Littman-Ovadia et al.'s (2014) study comparing Strengths-Based Career Counseling (SBCC) using VIA assessment to traditional career counseling, what was the key outcome difference at 3-month follow-up?{
=SBCC group achieved 80% employment rate versus 60% for traditional counseling, and only SBCC showed significant self-esteem gains #Correct! Littman-Ovadia et al. (2014) demonstrated that SBCC using VIA assessment produced superior outcomes\: 80% employment versus 60% for traditional counseling, plus significant self-esteem gains only in the SBCC group. Qualitatively, SBCC participants reported increased self-knowledge, improved career direction, confirmation of abilities, and improved confidence. This provides empirical evidence that strengths-based approaches produce better career outcomes.
~Both groups achieved identical employment rates and self-esteem changes #Incorrect. There were significant differences\: SBCC achieved 80% employment vs. 60% traditional, and only SBCC showed self-esteem gains.
~Traditional counseling outperformed SBCC in all measured outcomes #Incorrect. The opposite was true—SBCC outperformed traditional counseling in both employment rates (80% vs. 60%) and self-esteem changes.
~SBCC showed higher self-esteem but lower employment rates than traditional counseling #Incorrect. SBCC showed BOTH higher self-esteem AND higher employment rates (80% vs. 60%) compared to traditional counseling.
####Littman-Ovadia et al. (2014) tested <b>Strengths-Based Career Counseling (SBCC)</b> using VIA assessment versus traditional counseling. <b>Results</b>\: (1) <b>80% employment</b> in SBCC group vs. <b>60% traditional</b> at 3-month follow-up, (2) <b>Significant self-esteem gains</b> only in SBCC group, (3) <b>Qualitative findings</b>\: increased self-knowledge, improved career direction, confirmation of abilities, improved confidence. <b>Why does focusing on strengths work better?</b> Traditional counseling often focuses on skill deficits (what to fix). Strengths-based counseling focuses on what you already do well and how to leverage it, building confidence and helping you find roles aligning with natural talents. See Week 5 slide 16.}

::CliftonStrengths Validity Evidence::Reid and Short's (2024) study examining CliftonStrengths Assessment psychometric properties in college students found which concerning validity issue?{
=Less than one-quarter of the 34 themes showed adequate reliability in college student samples #Correct! Reid and Short (2024) found serious validity concerns\: less than half of the 34 CliftonStrengths themes showed adequate internal consistency in general populations, and less than one-quarter were reliable in college student samples specifically. The authors concluded that 'current evidence for implementing CSA in higher education is insufficient.' This contrasts with VIA Character Strengths, which has stronger psychometric support.
~All 34 themes demonstrated excellent reliability and validity across all populations #Incorrect. Reid and Short (2024) found the opposite—serious reliability concerns, with less than one-quarter of themes showing adequate reliability in college students.
~CliftonStrengths significantly outperformed VIA in predicting academic success #Incorrect. Reid and Short's study raised validity concerns about CliftonStrengths in college students. VIA has stronger psychometric evidence for this population.
~CliftonStrengths was more valid for students than for working professionals #Incorrect. Reid and Short found CliftonStrengths was LESS valid for college students than general populations, with less than one-quarter of themes showing adequate reliability in student samples.
####Reid and Short's (2024) critical evaluation found <b>serious psychometric concerns</b> for CliftonStrengths in college students\: <b>Less than half</b> of 34 themes showed adequate internal consistency (reliability) in general populations, and <b>less than one-quarter</b> were reliable in college student samples. If you take CliftonStrengths today and again next month, results might change substantially—not because you changed, but because the instrument is unreliable. Authors conclude evidence is <b>insufficient for higher education</b>. <b>Recommendation</b>\: Use <b>VIA Character Strengths</b> (free, better validated) as primary assessment. Understand CliftonStrengths conceptually for organizational contexts. <b>Broader lesson</b>\: Always ask about psychometric evidence—popular doesn't mean valid. See Week 5 slide 18.}

::Holland Code/RIASEC Types::In Holland's RIASEC model, what does the code "RIASEC" stand for, representing the six vocational interest types?{
=Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional #Correct! RIASEC represents six vocational interest types\: Realistic (hands-on work with tools/objects), Investigative (analytical, scientific problem-solving), Artistic (creative expression and innovation), Social (helping and teaching people), Enterprising (persuading, leading, managing), and Conventional (organizing data, maintaining systems). These types are arranged in a hexagon where adjacent types are more similar and opposite types are most different.
~Rational, Intuitive, Analytical, Strategic, Evaluative, Creative #Incorrect. These words don't represent Holland's RIASEC types. The correct types are Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional.
~Reflective, Independent, Ambitious, Structured, Energetic, Cautious #Incorrect. While these adjectives might describe personality traits, they are not Holland's RIASEC vocational interest types.
~Relational, Inventive, Authentic, Systematic, Entrepreneurial, Cooperative #Incorrect. These are not Holland's types. RIASEC stands for Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional.
####<b>RIASEC</b> represents six vocational interest types in Holland's model\: <b>(R) Realistic</b> (hands-on, practical work with tools/machines), <b>(I) Investigative</b> (analytical, scientific, intellectual work), <b>(A) Artistic</b> (creative, innovative, aesthetic expression), <b>(S) Social</b> (helping, teaching, supporting people), <b>(E) Enterprising</b> (persuading, leading, managing, influencing), <b>(C) Conventional</b> (organizing data, maintaining structured systems, detail work). Nauta (2010) explains these are arranged in a <b>hexagon</b> where <b>adjacent types</b> are more similar (e.g., R-I share analytical precision) and <b>opposite types</b> are most different (e.g., R-S\: things-focused vs. people-focused). Your Holland Code is typically a 3-letter combination like IAS or ESC. See Week 5 slide 21.}

::Holland Congruence Evidence::According to Nauta's (2010) review of Holland's theory, what was the meta-analytic finding for the congruence-satisfaction relationship, and how should this be interpreted?{
=Mean correlation r \= 0.17 (modest but consistent)—small effects matter over decades-long careers and help narrow 300+ career options #Correct! Tsabari et al.'s (2005) meta-analysis, reviewed by Nauta (2010), found a mean correlation of r \= 0.17 between congruence and satisfaction (\~3% of variance). While this sounds small, Nauta argues it's practically significant\: (1) small effects compound over 40-year careers, and (2) even modest effects are useful when narrowing 300+ possible careers to 10-20 worth exploring. Congruence is one factor among many but better than chance for predicting satisfaction.
~Mean correlation r \= 0.85 (very strong)—congruence is the primary determinant of career satisfaction #Incorrect. The actual correlation was r \= 0.17, which is modest, not very strong. Congruence is one of many factors affecting satisfaction, not the primary determinant.
~Mean correlation r \= 0.02 (negligible)—congruence has no practical value for career guidance #Incorrect. While the correlation is modest (r \= 0.17), not negligible (r \= 0.02), it has practical value for career exploration and hypothesis generation.
~Mean correlation r \= -0.30 (negative)—high congruence actually predicts lower satisfaction #Incorrect. The correlation is positive (r \= 0.17), not negative. Higher congruence predicts higher satisfaction, though the effect is modest.
####Holland's <b>congruence hypothesis</b>\: When person's interests match job environment, outcomes improve (satisfaction, performance, stability, well-being). <b>Meta-analytic evidence</b> (Tsabari et al., 2005)\: Mean correlation <b>r \= 0.17</b> between congruence and satisfaction—explains \~3% of variance. <b>Interpretation</b>\: This <b>modest but consistent</b> effect is practically significant because\: (1) Small effects <b>compound over decades</b>—being slightly more satisfied each day for 40 years matters, (2) Congruence is <b>one factor among many</b> (salary, culture, growth, location), (3) Better than chance for <b>narrowing 300+ careers</b> to 10-20 worth exploring. Use Holland Code to <b>generate hypotheses</b>, then <b>test through experience</b>. See Week 5 slide 22.}

::Multi-Framework Integration::A student's assessment results show\: VIA top strengths (Creativity, Curiosity, Love of Learning), Holland Code IAS (Investigative-Artistic-Social), and Big Five (High Openness, Moderate Extraversion). What is the best interpretation of these convergent patterns?{
=All frameworks point toward intellectual, creative work with learning opportunities—careers like research, strategy consulting, product innovation, or educational design #Correct! This example demonstrates convergence across multiple assessment frameworks\: Big Five Openness aligns with VIA Creativity and Curiosity; Holland Investigative-Artistic aligns with intellectual and creative work; Love of Learning suggests roles with continuous development. When multiple frameworks converge, this builds confidence in career direction. Importantly, these are hypotheses to test through experience, not definitive mandates. The key principle\: triangulation across methods increases confidence in self-knowledge.
~The results are contradictory and cannot be integrated into coherent career direction #Incorrect. These results actually show strong convergence, not contradiction. Creativity/Curiosity (VIA) + Investigative-Artistic (Holland) + High Openness (Big Five) all point toward intellectual, creative work.
~The results definitively prove the student must become a university professor #Incorrect. While the results suggest careers involving intellectual and creative work, they generate hypotheses to test, not definitive mandates. Many careers beyond academia fit this pattern\: consulting, innovation, design, etc.
~Only the Holland Code matters; VIA and Big Five results should be ignored #Incorrect. Integration across multiple frameworks builds stronger confidence than any single assessment. When VIA, Holland, and Big Five all converge, that's a robust signal worth exploring.
####This example demonstrates <b>assessment integration</b>\: (1) <b>Big Five</b> High Openness \= curiosity, creativity, (2) <b>VIA</b> Creativity + Curiosity + Love of Learning \= cognitive strengths cluster, (3) <b>Holland</b> IAS \= Investigative (analytical) + Artistic (creative) + Social (some people work). <b>Convergence</b>\: All frameworks point toward <b>intellectual, creative work with continuous learning</b>. <b>Career implications</b>\: Research, strategy consulting, product innovation, educational design, design thinking roles. <b>Key principles</b>\: (1) When multiple frameworks <b>converge</b>, confidence increases, (2) When frameworks <b>conflict</b>, investigate why—that's valuable information, (3) Assessments <b>generate hypotheses</b>; experience <b>tests them</b>. See Week 5 slides 26-27.}
