# Self-Discovery Through Assessment

**Understanding Your Unique Profile**

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 5. This week marks the shift from learning ABOUT development to discovering YOUR specific development needs. Students should have completed all 5 self-assessments before today's class: MBTI/16Personalities, VIA Character Strengths, CliftonStrengths, Emotional Intelligence, and Holland Code. Today we'll learn to interpret results critically and integrate insights into career planning.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="Hook">

# 80%

**of career success comes from self-awareness and emotional intelligence — not technical skills**

*(TalentSmart Research, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
This statistic surprises students who've spent years developing technical competencies. Accounting, finance, coding, design—these get you hired. But self-awareness determines how far you advance and how satisfied you are. Common student question: "How can something so intangible matter more than skills?" Answer: Because careers are built on relationships, decision-making, and choosing opportunities that align with strengths. Technical skills are table stakes; self-knowledge is the differentiator.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the Johari Window framework and why self-awareness requires both internal reflection and external feedback
2. **Evaluate** MBTI's validity using psychometric evidence (Erford et al., 2025)
3. **Apply** VIA Character Strengths to identify signature strengths and career applications
4. **Understand** CliftonStrengths' talent development philosophy and evidence limitations
5. **Use** Holland Code (RIASEC) to match personality preferences with career environments

<speaker-notes>
These objectives reflect the five assessment tools students completed. Critical thinking is emphasized—we're not just accepting assessments at face value but learning to evaluate their scientific rigor. Objective 2 (MBTI evaluation) often surprises students who assume popular = valid. The Erford et al. (2025) study provides current evidence for critical discussion.

<slide number="4" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You: Personal Development Plan (40%)

**Part 1: Self-Knowledge Foundation (20% of PDP grade)**
- Summary of all 5 self-assessments (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, EI, Holland Code)
- 200-300 word integration statement identifying patterns across assessments
- Career implications of your unique profile

**Due:** Week 11 (November 28, 2025)

**Mentorship Connection:** Your Mentorship Meeting #2 (happening this week or next) focuses on sharing assessment results with your mentor and discussing career implications.

<speaker-notes>
Emphasize that assessments aren't just theoretical exercises—they're the foundation of the semester's capstone assessment. Students who complete assessments thoughtfully this week will have much easier time writing Part 1 of PDP. The integration statement is where critical thinking matters: What consistent themes emerge? Do results contradict? What does your unique combination suggest about career fit?

Mentors provide external perspective (the "blind spot" we'll discuss in Johari Window). Students should bring printed assessment results to Meeting #2.

## Today's Journey

**Part 1:** The Science of Self-Awareness (Johari Window)
**Part 2:** Personality Assessment—MBTI Under the Microscope
**Part 3:** Strengths-Based Development (VIA & CliftonStrengths)
**Part 4:** Career-Personality Fit (Holland Code/RIASEC)
**Part 5:** Integration & Next Steps

<speaker-notes>
Visual roadmap helps students track progress. This is a content-heavy lecture (30 slides) because we're covering 5 frameworks, so clear segmentation matters. Return to this slide at each transition to maintain orientation. Part 2 (MBTI) will be the most critical examination—students often arrive with uncritical faith in personality typing, and we'll examine validity evidence together.

# Part 1
## The Science of Self-Awareness

<speaker-notes>
Transition to first segment. We start with foundational theory before diving into specific tools. The Johari Window explains WHY we need multiple sources of self-knowledge—personal reflection alone is insufficient.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="The Johari Window">

## The Johari Window (Luft & Ingham, 1955)

|                     | **Known to Self** | **Unknown to Self** |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Known to Others** | **OPEN AREA**<br>Public self | **BLIND SPOT**<br>What others see but you don't |
| **Unknown to Others** | **HIDDEN AREA**<br>Private self | **UNKNOWN**<br>Undiscovered potential |

**Goal:** Expand the Open Area through self-disclosure and feedback-seeking

<speaker-notes>
The Johari Window is a simple but powerful framework created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham in 1955 (hence "Jo-Hari"—their names combined). Draw attention to each quadrant:

**Open Area:** Things you know about yourself AND others can see—your public persona, obvious strengths, stated values. Example: "I'm good at public speaking" (you know it, others observe it).

**Blind Spot:** Things others see but you don't recognize—could be positive (undervaluing a strength) or negative (unconscious habit). Example: You don't realize you interrupt people, but colleagues notice. This is why 360-degree feedback matters.

**Hidden Area:** Things you know but deliberately conceal—fears, insecurities, private ambitions. Strategic self-disclosure in safe contexts (like mentorship) can turn this into Open Area.

**Unknown:** Potential talents, latent abilities, unexplored interests. Experiential learning (field trips, new challenges) helps discover this quadrant.

Common student question: "Isn't it risky to expand Open Area by revealing Hidden info?" Yes—choose wisely WHOM to disclose to. Mentors are safe; LinkedIn posts are not.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" title="Two Dimensions of Self-Awareness">

## Self-Awareness Has Two Dimensions (London et al., 2023)

**Internal Self-Awareness:** Understanding your own values, interests, goals, emotions, cognitive patterns
- Tool: Introspection, journaling, self-assessments
- Risk: Rumination (getting stuck in negative self-focus)

**External Self-Awareness:** Understanding how others perceive you—your impact, social skills, reputation
- Tool: 360-degree feedback, mentor insights, peer observations
- Risk: Overconformity (changing yourself to match others' expectations)

**Both are essential.** Internal only = blind spots. External only = chameleon with no core.

<speaker-notes>
London et al.'s (2023) Annual Review article synthesizes decades of self-awareness research. Key insight: these dimensions are INDEPENDENT—you can be high on one and low on the other.

Examples:
- High internal, low external: Deep self-knowledge but unaware of how you come across. May think you're collaborative but colleagues find you domineering.
- Low internal, high external: Very socially attuned, reads rooms well, but lacks clarity on personal values. Adapts too much, loses authenticity.
- High on both: Sweet spot—knows who you are AND how you land with others. Can adapt strategically without losing core self.

This explains why self-assessments alone aren't enough—hence the mentorship program's emphasis on feedback-seeking. Your mentor provides external perspective.

The "dark side" warning is important: excessive introspection without action leads to rumination, which predicts depression. Balance reflection with experimentation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Self-Knowledge Asymmetries">

## The Self-Other Knowledge Asymmetry (Neubauer et al., 2018)

Research with 448 students found different types of intelligence fall into different Johari quadrants:

- **Numerical intelligence:** Open Area—both self and others rate accurately
- **Verbal intelligence:** Blind Spot for younger students—others rate you higher than you rate yourself
- **Intrapersonal competence (emotional intelligence):** Hidden Area—you know it, but others can't see it easily
- **Spatial ability:** Unknown—neither self nor others rate accurately

**Implication:** Young professionals have *biased* self-views. Professional assessment tools help calibrate.

<speaker-notes>
This 2018 study in *Heliyon* provides empirical evidence for the Johari Window concept. It tested Vazire's Self-Other Knowledge Asymmetry (SOKA) model using objective ability tests plus self-ratings and peer ratings.

Key finding: Age 18-25 students (your demographic) systematically mis-estimate their abilities in predictable ways. Verbal intelligence blind spot is particularly relevant for international business students—you may undervalue your English communication skills because you compare yourself to native speakers, while employers see strong bilingual capability.

Why this matters for assessments: MBTI, VIA, and Holland Code are SELF-REPORT tools—they measure your self-perception, not objective reality. That's why integrating mentor feedback (external view) is critical. CliftonStrengths and some EI tools include 360-degree components to address this.

Common student question: "If self-assessments are biased, why do them?" Answer: Because self-perception influences behavior. If you underestimate your verbal intelligence, you won't pursue opportunities requiring communication. Assessments + external feedback = more accurate picture.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="10" layout="section-break" title="Part 2">

# Part 2
## Personality Assessment: MBTI Under the Microscope

<speaker-notes>
Transition to MBTI segment. This is the most widely used assessment in career counseling (Erford et al., 2025), which is why we dedicate substantial time to it. Students often arrive with strong opinions—some love MBTI, some dismiss it. We'll examine evidence so they can form educated opinions.

Set expectations: "MBTI is controversial in psychology. We're going to look at the latest scientific evidence—both strengths and limitations. By the end, you'll be able to use it wisely without over-relying on it."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="What Is MBTI?">

## Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

**Based on:** Carl Jung's psychological types (1921), adapted by Katharine Briggs & Isabel Myers (1940s)

**Four Dichotomies:**
1. **Extraversion (E)** vs. **Introversion (I):** Energy source—outer world or inner world?
2. **Sensing (S)** vs. **Intuition (N):** Information processing—concrete details or abstract patterns?
3. **Thinking (T)** vs. **Feeling (F):** Decision-making—logic/analysis or values/harmony?
4. **Judging (J)** vs. **Perceiving (P):** Lifestyle—structured/planned or flexible/spontaneous?

**Result:** 16 personality types (e.g., INTJ, ESFP, ENFJ)

<speaker-notes>
Provide brief historical context. Jung's original theory had only 3 dimensions; Myers-Briggs added the fourth (J-P). Isabel Myers was not a psychologist—she was a writer who became interested in Jung's work and developed the indicator as a practical tool during WWII to help women entering workforce find suitable jobs.

Explain each dichotomy briefly with examples:
- E/I: Extraverts gain energy from social interaction; Introverts recharge in solitude. NOT about social skills—introverts can be excellent networkers, they just find it draining rather than energizing.
- S/N: Sensors trust concrete, tangible data ("What is?"); Intuitives see patterns and possibilities ("What could be?"). Accountants often Sensing; entrepreneurs often Intuitive.
- T/F: Thinkers prioritize objective analysis; Feelers prioritize impact on people. Both can make good decisions—just different decision-making styles.
- J/P: Judgers prefer closure and structure; Perceivers prefer openness and flexibility. Judgers make to-do lists; Perceivers resist them.

Note: Most students took 16Personalities.com (free version), not official MBTI. We'll discuss implications of this in validity section.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="MBTI Psychometric Evidence">

## What Does Science Say About MBTI? (Erford et al., 2025)

**Largest MBTI review ever:** 193 studies (1999-2024), 25-year synthesis

**Reliability (Internal Consistency):**
- α = 0.845-0.921 across four scales
- **Verdict:** Acceptable reliability ✓

**Validity (Does it measure what it claims?):**
- Convergent validity with similar instruments: Only 2.8% of correlations reached r ≥ 0.50 threshold
- Correlations with career outcomes: Only 0.5% reached r ≥ 0.50
- **Verdict:** Weak validity ✗

**Critical Issue:** Continuous traits forced into binary categories (you're not "100% Extraverted" or "100% Introverted"—you're on a spectrum, but MBTI gives you a single letter)

<speaker-notes>
This is the most important slide for developing critical thinking about assessments. Erford et al.'s 2025 study in *Journal of Counseling & Development* is the definitive current evidence.

Break down the findings:

**Reliability = Consistency:** If you take MBTI twice, do you get the same type? Answer: Mostly yes (0.85-0.92 is good). But 40-75% of people get different types when retested (because they're near the middle of dichotomies).

**Validity = Accuracy:** Does MBTI actually measure what it claims and predict what it promises? Answer: Weak evidence. It doesn't correlate well with other personality measures (Big Five) or with career success/satisfaction.

**The binary problem:** If you score 51% Extraverted, MBTI labels you "E" (same as someone who scores 95% Extraverted). You're very different people, but MBTI treats you identically. This is why Big Five (which uses continuous scales) has better validity.

**Career prediction:** MBTI has almost no correlation with job performance, satisfaction, or success. This is a problem because it's marketed as a career tool.

Common student reaction: "But MBTI felt so accurate when I read my type description!" Address the Barnum Effect: Type descriptions are written broadly enough that most people see themselves in them (like horoscopes). This is why psychologists require empirical validation beyond subjective "fit."

**Caveat:** We're not saying MBTI is useless—it can spark self-reflection and provide vocabulary for discussing preferences. But treat it as a conversation-starter, not a scientific diagnosis.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="How to Use MBTI Wisely">

## Using MBTI as a Tool, Not a Label

**DO:**
- Use it as a starting point for self-reflection
- Recognize it describes *preferences*, not abilities (introverts CAN lead; thinkers CAN empathize)
- Discuss your type with your mentor—they'll offer external perspective
- Explore type descriptions for career suggestions, but verify with other data

**DON'T:**
- Use it to limit yourself ("I'm an ISFJ, so I can't be an entrepreneur")
- Assume it predicts job performance—evidence shows it doesn't
- Treat your type as fixed—people change, especially ages 18-25
- Choose career paths based solely on MBTI compatibility

**Bottom line:** MBTI is one data point among many. Cross-check with VIA, Holland Code, mentor feedback, and actual experiences.

<speaker-notes>
This slide provides practical guidance after the critical examination. Students need to know how to use imperfect tools wisely rather than dismissing them entirely or accepting them uncritically.

**The flexibility message is crucial:** Research shows personality is most fluid in emerging adulthood (ages 18-25). Your MBTI type at 19 may not be your type at 29. Don't let a 4-letter label box you in.

**Real-world example:** Many successful entrepreneurs test as Introverts (e.g., Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg). MBTI type doesn't determine capability—it describes natural preferences. With motivation and practice, anyone can develop skills outside their preference zone.

**Mentor discussion:** Encourage students to share MBTI results with mentors in Meeting #2 and ask: "Does this match how you see me? What am I not seeing about myself?" This addresses the Blind Spot quadrant.

**Integration with PDP:** In the Personal Development Plan integration statement, students should note BOTH what MBTI suggests AND its limitations. Example: "MBTI indicates ENTJ, suggesting leadership roles—but Erford's research shows weak career prediction, so I'm cross-checking with Holland Code and mentor observations."

Common question: "If MBTI is weak, why is it so popular?" Answer: Marketing, simplicity, and the appeal of simple answers to complex questions. Scientific validity ≠ popularity. Critical thinking means evaluating tools based on evidence, not cultural acceptance.

# Part 3
## Strengths-Based Development

<speaker-notes>
Transition to strengths assessments. After the critical MBTI discussion, students may wonder if any assessments are valid. VIA and CliftonStrengths take a different approach—focusing on what you do well (strengths) rather than categorizing your personality (types). We'll examine both, noting that VIA has stronger validity evidence.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="VIA Character Strengths">

## VIA Character Strengths Framework (Peterson & Seligman, 2004)

**6 Virtues, 24 Character Strengths**

| Virtue | Character Strengths |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Wisdom** | Creativity, Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective |
| **Courage** | Bravery, Perseverance, Honesty, Zest |
| **Humanity** | Love, Kindness, Social Intelligence |
| **Justice** | Teamwork, Fairness, Leadership |
| **Temperance** | Forgiveness, Humility, Prudence, Self-Regulation |
| **Transcendence** | Appreciation of Beauty, Gratitude, Hope, Humor, Spirituality |

**Your "Signature Strengths":** Your top 5-7 strengths—these are energizing, authentic, and essential to who you are.

<speaker-notes>
VIA Character Strengths represents 3 years of work by 55 scientists creating positive psychology's equivalent of the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual). Instead of cataloging mental disorders, they cataloged human strengths across cultures.

Explain the difference between virtues and strengths: Virtues (6) are broad value categories recognized across cultures and religions. Strengths (24) are specific, measurable routes to those virtues. Example: The virtue "Wisdom" can be expressed through Curiosity (asking questions), Judgment (critical thinking), or Perspective (seeing big picture)—different people express the same virtue differently.

**Signature Strengths concept:** Research shows people have 5-7 strengths that are most central to their identity. These are strengths you:
- Display often and naturally
- Feel energized (not drained) when using
- Find intrinsically motivating
- Feel most authentically "yourself" when expressing

Ask students: "Look at your VIA results. Do your top 5 feel right? Are there surprises?" Common surprise: Students often undervalue strengths like Humility or Prudence because they're less flashy than Leadership or Creativity, but they're equally valuable.

**Cross-cultural note:** VIA has been validated in Vietnamese populations. However, cultural display rules differ—Vietnamese students often rank Humility and Teamwork higher than Western samples, which rank Zest and Bravery higher.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="VIA in Career Development">

## Using Character Strengths for Career Success

**Research (Littman-Ovadia et al., 2014):** Strengths-Based Career Counseling Study

**Method:** Career counselors helped job-seekers identify and apply signature strengths to career planning (4-session intervention)

**Results after 3 months:**
- **80%** employment rate (Strengths-Based group) vs. 60% (traditional counseling)
- **Significant gains** in self-esteem and career clarity
- **Qualitative insights:** Increased confidence, confirmation of abilities, improved career direction

**How you can apply this:**
- Identify signature strengths → Seek roles that use them daily
- Craft your work to leverage strengths (Job Crafting approach)
- Discuss with mentor: "What roles would let me use Curiosity + Judgment + Creativity together?"

<speaker-notes>
This study provides empirical evidence that strengths-based approaches work. It's not just feel-good psychology—it produces measurable outcomes.

Key findings to emphasize:
- 20% higher employment rate is substantial (80% vs. 60% success)
- Self-esteem gains matter because job-seeking is emotionally draining
- Career clarity reduces decision paralysis—students know what to look for

**Job Crafting concept:** Amy Wrzesniewski's research shows you can redesign tasks within a role to align with strengths. Example: If you're a Marketing Analyst with Love of Learning as signature strength, you could volunteer to research new analytics tools—you're doing your job AND using your strength.

**For students:** In your PDP, you'll be asked "How will you leverage your signature strengths in your career?" This study shows it's not just about finding the perfect role—it's about actively crafting experiences to use strengths. Even in internships or early jobs with limited autonomy, you can shape HOW you approach tasks.

**Mentor conversation starter:** "My VIA shows Curiosity, Judgment, and Social Intelligence as top strengths. What roles or industries would let me combine these? How can I use these in my first job even if it's not my dream role?"

Common student question: "What if my strengths don't match my career interest?" Example: Student wants finance role but top strengths are Creativity and Humor. Answer: Finance needs creativity (innovative solutions, novel approaches)—don't assume creativity only belongs in arts. Also, consider whether the career interest is authentic or based on external pressure.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="17" title="CliftonStrengths Overview">

## CliftonStrengths (Gallup)

**Philosophy:** Focus on *talents* (natural patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving) and develop them into *strengths* through practice and skill-building.

**34 Talent Themes across 4 Domains:**
- **Strategic Thinking:** Analytical, Futuristic, Ideation, Input, Intellection, Learner, Strategic
- **Executing:** Achiever, Arranger, Consistency, Deliberative, Discipline, Focus, Responsibility, Restorative
- **Influencing:** Activator, Command, Communication, Competition, Maximizer, Self-Assurance, Significance, Woo
- **Relationship Building:** Adaptability, Connectedness, Developer, Empathy, Harmony, Includer, Individualization, Positivity, Relator

**Your Top 5 Themes:** These are your most dominant talents to build into strengths.

<speaker-notes>
CliftonStrengths comes from Gallup's decades of workplace research. Don Clifton asked "What if we studied what's right with people instead of what's wrong?" The assessment emerged from interviews with top performers across industries to identify common talent patterns.

Explain the talents → strengths progression:
- **Talent:** Natural, recurring pattern. Example: You naturally notice what's wrong and want to fix it (Restorative).
- **Strength:** Talent + investment (knowledge, skills, practice). Restorative talent + engineering education = strong problem-solving ability.

Domains help you see overall profile:
- Heavy on Strategic Thinking? You're the idea person.
- Heavy on Executing? You're the "get it done" person.
- Heavy on Influencing? You're the "rally the troops" person.
- Heavy on Relationship Building? You're the team glue.

Most people have talents across multiple domains—that's fine. But if all 5 are in one domain, consider developing complementary strengths. Example: All Strategic Thinking? Partner with an Executor to implement your ideas.

**Access note:** Students received free CliftonStrengths access codes with course materials. If someone doesn't have results yet, they can complete it this week and integrate into PDP later.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="CliftonStrengths: Evidence and Caution">

## Critical Note: CliftonStrengths Validity (Reid & Short, 2024)

**Recent Research Alert:** Study published in *Consulting Psychology Journal* examined CliftonStrengths in higher education settings.

**Findings:**
- Less than **half** (17 of 34 themes) showed adequate internal consistency (α > 0.70) in general population
- Less than **one-quarter** (8 of 34 themes) showed adequate reliability in college student samples specifically
- **Authors' conclusion:** "The current available evidence for implementing the CSA within higher education is insufficient"

**What this means for you:**
- VIA Character Strengths has stronger validation—prioritize VIA when results conflict
- Use CliftonStrengths for its rich language/vocabulary about talents, not as scientific diagnosis
- Discuss results with mentor—do they see these talents in you? External validation helps
- Focus on the 8 validated themes if yours include them; be more cautious about the others

<speaker-notes>
This is the second critical examination slide (after MBTI). Students need to know that popular doesn't mean valid. CliftonStrengths is widely used in corporate training, but Reid & Short's 2024 study found significant psychometric problems, especially for college-age populations.

**Reliability issues explained:** Low internal consistency means items within a theme don't correlate well—they may be measuring different things. This is a fundamental validity problem.

**The 8 validated themes** (for college students): Achiever, Analytical, Competition, Consistency, Deliberative, Empathy, Harmony, Restorative. If students' top 5 include these, results are more trustworthy. Other themes (e.g., Command, Futuristic, Woo) showed poor reliability.

**Why include CliftonStrengths if it has problems?** Three reasons:
1. Students already completed it (free codes provided)
2. The talent language is rich and helpful for career conversations, even if measurement is imperfect
3. Learning to critically evaluate assessments IS a learning objective—we don't just use perfect tools, we learn to assess quality

**For PDP integration:** Students should note in their integration statement: "CliftonStrengths indicates [Top 5], though Reid & Short (2024) caution about reliability in college populations. I'm prioritizing VIA Character Strengths (better validation) where results overlap." This demonstrates critical thinking.

**Mentor discussion:** "My CliftonStrengths shows [results]. Do you see these talents in how I approach work? Where do you think my talents lie?" External perspective helps validate or question self-assessment results.

Common student reaction: "Why did we spend money on this if it's not valid?" Clarify: Access was free (course-provided codes), and learning to evaluate tools IS valuable. Professional life requires assessing advice, tools, and frameworks critically—this is practice.

## Career-Personality Fit: Holland Code (RIASEC)

<speaker-notes>
Transition to Holland Code, which shifts focus from personality description to career environment fit. Unlike MBTI (describing who you are) or strengths (what you do well), Holland Code focuses on what work environments you prefer and perform best in. This is the most directly career-relevant of the five assessments.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="framework" title="Holland's RIASEC Model">

## Holland's Theory of Vocational Personalities (Nauta, 2010)

**Six Personality Types & Work Environments:**

| Type | Personality Traits | Preferred Work | Example Careers |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **R - Realistic** | Practical, hands-on, mechanical | Physical, technical tasks | Engineering, Architecture, Skilled trades |
| **I - Investigative** | Analytical, intellectual, curious | Research, problem-solving | Science, Data analysis, Research |
| **A - Artistic** | Creative, expressive, original | Unstructured, creative work | Design, Marketing, Media |
| **S - Social** | Helpful, empathetic, collaborative | People-oriented, teaching, helping | HR, Teaching, Counseling |
| **E - Enterprising** | Persuasive, ambitious, leadership | Influencing, leading, selling | Management, Sales, Entrepreneurship |
| **C - Conventional** | Organized, detail-oriented, systematic | Structured, data-focused tasks | Accounting, Admin, Operations |

**Your Holland Code:** 3-letter combination (e.g., ASE, RIC, ESC)

<speaker-notes>
John Holland's theory (1959, refined through 1997) is one of the most enduring and well-validated frameworks in career counseling. Unlike MBTI's contested validity, Holland Code has robust empirical support (Nauta, 2010).

**Key principle:** Person-environment fit predicts satisfaction and success. People thrive when their personality type matches their work environment. Misalignment causes dissatisfaction, frequent job changes, and underperformance.

Walk through each type with Vietnamese career context:

**Realistic (R):** Prefers working with things, tools, machines rather than people or abstract ideas. Vietnam's manufacturing growth offers many R careers (engineering, industrial design, quality control).

**Investigative (I):** Prefers abstract problem-solving and intellectual challenges. Strong fit for Vietnam's growing tech and research sectors (software development, data science, research institutes).

**Artistic (A):** Prefers creative, unstructured expression. Vietnam's creative economy is expanding (advertising, digital content, UX design)—don't assume "artist" means starving painter.

**Social (S):** Prefers helping and working with people. Education, healthcare, HR, NGO work—all growth sectors in Vietnam. Note: Doesn't mean you must be extraverted; many counselors are introverts who connect deeply one-on-one.

**Enterprising (E):** Prefers leading, persuading, and taking risks. Natural fit for business management, sales, entrepreneurship. Strong alignment with BBAE program goals.

**Conventional (C):** Prefers structure, accuracy, and systems. Accounting, finance, operations management—foundational business functions. Not "boring"—these roles are critical for organizational success.

**3-letter code:** Most people are combinations. ASE = Artistic-Social-Enterprising might thrive in marketing (creative + people-oriented + persuasive). RIC = Realistic-Investigative-Conventional might excel in civil engineering (technical + analytical + systematic).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="The RIASEC Hexagon">

## Holland's Hexagonal Model: Understanding Compatibility

```
        R ----------- I
       /               \
      /                 \
     C                   A
      \                 /
       \               /
        E ----------- S
```

**Adjacent types** (close on hexagon) are compatible:
- R-I, I-A, A-S, S-E, E-C, C-R
- Example: RI (Realistic-Investigative) = Engineer who does research

**Opposite types** (across hexagon) are less compatible:
- R-S, I-E, A-C
- Example: AC (Artistic-Conventional) = tension between creativity and structure

**Differentiation:** Clear preferences = easier career decisions. Flat profile = more options but harder to decide.

<speaker-notes>
The hexagon is a key insight from Holland's theory. Types aren't random—they're arranged by similarity. Understanding adjacency helps explain why some career combinations work and others create internal tension.

**Adjacent compatibility explained:**
- People with codes close on hexagon share values and approach to work
- Careers requiring adjacent types feel coherent (e.g., RIC engineers: hands-on + analytical + organized)
- You can develop skills in adjacent areas more easily

**Opposite type conflicts:**
- AC (Artistic-Conventional): Creative freedom vs. structured systems—both pull at you
- IS (Investigative-Social): Abstract analysis vs. people interaction—divided focus
- RE (Realistic-Enterprising): Hands-on technical work vs. leading/persuading people

**What if you're opposite types?** Two strategies:
1. Find hybrid careers that honor both (e.g., AC might thrive in museum curation: art + systematic cataloging)
2. Separate work and hobbies (e.g., Conventional accountant with Artistic painting hobby)

**Differentiation matters:** Strong peaks (one type dominates) = clear direction, easier choices, but potentially narrow. Flat profile (all types similar scores) = versatile, adaptable, but may struggle choosing direction. Neither is better—just different challenges.

**For students:** In PDP integration statement, explain how your 3-letter code aligns or conflicts with career interests. Example: "My ESC code (Enterprising-Social-Conventional) aligns well with business management—I want to lead (E), work with people (S), in structured environments (C). This explains why I'm drawn to corporate rather than startup contexts."

## What Does Research Say About Holland Code? (Nauta, 2010)

**Congruence Hypothesis:** Person-environment fit predicts outcomes

**Meta-analytic evidence:**
- **Job satisfaction:** r = .17 (Tsabari et al., 2005)—modest but consistent
- **Career stability:** People in congruent careers change jobs less frequently
- **Performance:** Small positive effects (r = .10-.15)

**Verdict:** Statistically significant but *modest* effects

**What this means:**
- Holland Code predicts satisfaction better than performance
- It's ONE factor among many (salary, boss quality, commute, company culture also matter)
- Use it as a filter ("What types of work environments suit me?") not a prescription ("I MUST have an ESC job")

<speaker-notes>
Compared to MBTI's weak validity, Holland Code has solid but modest empirical support. The meta-analytic correlation of r = .17 between fit and satisfaction is considered "small to medium" in psychology, but it's robust across hundreds of studies.

**Interpret the correlation:** If 100 people have congruent careers and 100 have incongruent careers, you'll see higher average satisfaction in the congruent group—but plenty of individuals will defy the trend. It's probabilistic, not deterministic.

**Why performance effects are weaker than satisfaction effects:** Holland Code measures preferences, not abilities. You might prefer Social environments but have strong analytical skills that make you excellent in Investigative work. You perform well but feel less satisfied. Conversely, loving your work (high congruence) doesn't guarantee you're good at it without developing skills.

**Practical application:** Use Holland Code to:
1. Generate career options you might not have considered (explore careers matching your code)
2. Understand why some past experiences felt right or wrong (fit analysis)
3. Evaluate job offers (does this environment match my preferences?)
4. Discuss with mentor ("My code is X—what careers would leverage this?")

**Don't use Holland Code to:** Eliminate careers solely based on mismatch. If you're passionate about a career that doesn't match your code, that passion may override fit. Also, many careers span multiple types—Marketing can be A+S+E, appealing to different profiles.

**Big Five connection:** Holland types map roughly onto Big Five personality dimensions:
- Social/Enterprising ↔ Extraversion
- Artistic/Investigative ↔ Openness to Experience
- Conventional ↔ Conscientiousness

This cross-validation strengthens confidence in Holland framework.

<slide number="23" title="Using Holland Code">

## Applying Holland Code to Career Planning

**Step 1: Identify your 3-letter code**
- O*NET Interest Profiler (free): onetonline.org
- Most students took this as Week 5 preparation

**Step 2: Research careers matching your code**
- O*NET database links codes to 900+ occupations
- Vietnam Career Orientation System also uses RIASEC

**Step 3: Discuss with your mentor (Meeting #2)**
- "My code is [X]. What careers would fit this profile?"
- "I'm interested in [Y career]. Does my code suggest fit or challenge?"

**Step 4: Test through experience**
- Theory is useful, but experience is proof
- Seek internships, projects, or informational interviews in code-aligned fields
- Notice: Do you feel energized or drained? That's congruence feedback

<speaker-notes>
This slide shifts from theory to application—students need concrete steps to use Holland Code practically.

**O*NET Interest Profiler:** Free US Department of Labor tool that administers Holland assessment and links to Occupational Information Network database. It's the most comprehensive career-code matching resource available. International students can use it—occupations translate across countries.

**Vietnam context:** Ministry of Labour uses adapted RIASEC in National Career Orientation System. Local career centers can help students explore Vietnam-specific career paths matching their codes.

**Mentor Meeting #2 timing:** This week or next week is when students should share all assessment results with mentors. Holland Code is particularly valuable for mentors to discuss because they have insider knowledge of industries and can reality-check code-career fit.

**Example mentor conversation:**
Student: "I'm ESC [Enterprising-Social-Conventional]. I'm interested in Marketing Management."
Mentor: "Great fit. Marketing management requires persuasion (E), team collaboration (S), and campaign organization (C). But be aware—agency marketing is more A+E, corporate marketing is more E+C. Which appeals more?"

**Experiential testing is crucial:** Career theories predict probabilities, but individual fit is idiosyncratic. A student might be IAR (Investigative-Artistic-Realistic) and theoretically mismatch for teaching, but discover they love teaching research methods—hybrid role that incorporates all three types.

**For PDP:** Students should reference Holland Code when setting 1-year experience goals. Example: "My ASE code suggests marketing fit. Goal: Complete summer internship at creative agency to test this alignment before committing to marketing specialization junior year."

Common question: "What if my code doesn't match my current major?" Answer: (1) Most majors prepare for multiple careers—Business Administration isn't just one Holland type. (2) You can craft your career within the major to match your code. (3) If severe mismatch and persistent dissatisfaction, consider this valuable self-knowledge for pivoting early rather than after graduating.

# Part 5
## Integration & Next Steps

<speaker-notes>
Final segment ties everything together. Students now have results from 5 assessments—how do they make sense of this data? The integration process is where learning happens.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Cross-Assessment Integration">

## Finding Patterns Across All 5 Assessments

**Look for convergence:**
- Do MBTI, Holland Code, and CliftonStrengths tell a coherent story?
- Example: ENFJ (MBTI) + Social-Enterprising (Holland) + Communication + Empathy (CliftonStrengths) + Love + Leadership (VIA) = Strong pattern suggesting people-focused leadership career

**Notice contradictions:**
- INTJ (MBTI) but Social (Holland Code)—both can be true! Introverts can prefer working with people; they just need recharge time
- High Creativity (VIA) but Conventional (Holland)—suggests need for creative problem-solving within structured systems

**Consider what's missing:**
- All assessments focus on Social/Enterprising but low Investigative—might struggle with deep analytical work
- Strong Artistic but no mention in other assessments—might be underdeveloped talent or interest vs. strength distinction

<speaker-notes>
This is the most intellectually demanding part of the week—synthesizing multiple data sources into coherent self-understanding. Students will do this formally in their PDP integration statement (200-300 words), but today we teach the thinking process.

**Convergence example (real student profile):**
- MBTI: ESFJ (Extraverted-Sensing-Feeling-Judging)
- Holland Code: SEC (Social-Enterprising-Conventional)
- CliftonStrengths: Harmony, Includer, Responsibility, Consistency, Developer
- VIA: Kindness, Teamwork, Fairness, Love, Social Intelligence

**Interpretation:** Extremely consistent pattern—people-oriented, values relationships and harmony, organized/structured approach. Career implications: HR, nonprofit management, team coordination roles. Would likely struggle in competitive sales or highly technical solitary work.

**Contradiction example (another real profile):**
- MBTI: INTP (Introverted-Intuitive-Thinking-Perceiving)
- Holland Code: ASE (Artistic-Social-Enterprising)
- This seems contradictory—analytical introvert vs. creative social entrepreneur?

**Resolution:** Look deeper. INTP + Artistic = UX design (analytical creativity). Add Social = user research, empathy for users. Add Enterprising = design thinking leadership. Career: Design Strategist. The contradiction resolved by finding hybrid career.

**What's missing matters too:**
If ALL five assessments emphasize people skills (Social, Feeling, Empathy, Love) with zero mention of analysis or systems, this student may need to consciously develop Investigative or Conventional skills for career success—most business roles require SOME analytical or organizational capability.

**Emotional Intelligence note:** We haven't discussed EI results in detail (that's Week 7's focus), but students should note if EI results contradict other assessments. Example: VIA shows Social Intelligence + Kindness but EI self-assessment shows low empathy—worth exploring with mentor.

**PDP Integration Statement:** Students will write 200-300 words synthesizing ALL five assessments. Provide formula:
1. What patterns emerge? (2-3 themes)
2. What contradictions exist? (1-2, with your interpretation)
3. What does this mean for career direction? (1-2 sentences)

<slide number="26" title="Avoiding Assessment Pitfalls">

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Over-identification**
- ❌ "I'm an INTJ, so I can't work in teams"
- ✓ "I prefer independent work, but I can collaborate when needed"

**2. Using assessments as excuses**
- ❌ "My CliftonStrengths doesn't include Discipline, so I can't meet deadlines"
- ✓ "I'll build systems to compensate for this non-talent"

**3. Ignoring context and development**
- ❌ "This is who I am forever"
- ✓ "This is where I am now; I can grow"

**4. Choosing assessments over experience**
- ❌ "Holland Code says I'm not Conventional, so I won't try that internship"
- ✓ "Let me test it—theory isn't always right for me"

**5. Forgetting the Johari Window**
- ❌ Relying only on self-assessments
- ✓ Seeking mentor/peer feedback to reduce blind spots

<speaker-notes>
After emphasizing assessment utility, we need to warn against misuse. These are common traps students fall into, especially those who discover assessments for the first time and get excited about self-knowledge.

**Over-identification is the #1 problem:** Students treat MBTI or CliftonStrengths like astrology—it becomes their identity rather than a data point. Remind them: You are not a 4-letter code or a Top 5 list. You are a complex human being with agency.

**Using assessments as excuses:** Sometimes students use results to justify not developing weaknesses. "I don't have Discipline, so it's fine that I'm always late." No—professional success requires baseline competencies even in non-talent areas. CliftonStrengths philosophy says focus on strengths, but that doesn't mean ignore fundamental skills.

**The fixed mindset trap:** This connects to Week 9 (Growth Mindset). Assessments measure current state, not potential. Personality is most plastic ages 18-25 (your demographic). Treating results as fixed violates growth mindset principles.

**Theory vs. experience:** Assessments are probabilistic models, not deterministic prophecies. If you're passionate about a career that "doesn't fit" your profile, try it anyway. Passion and deliberate practice can overcome fit limitations. Also, you might be an outlier—statistics describe groups, not every individual.

**Johari Window callback:** Self-assessments only capture Open Area + Hidden Area (what you know). They miss Blind Spot (what others see that you don't). Mentor feedback, 360-degree reviews, and honest peer observations are essential supplements.

**Real-world example:** Share story of successful professional whose career defied assessments. Example: ISTJ (MBTI) accountant who discovered passion for training and became corporate trainer—blended Conventional background with developed Social skills.

**For students:** Encourage experimental mindset. "My assessments suggest X, so I'll test that hypothesis through experiences. If reality contradicts assessments, reality wins."

<slide number="27" title="Action Steps This Week">

## What To Do With Your Results

**By end of Week 5:**
- [ ] Complete all 5 assessments if not done already (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, EI, Holland Code)
- [ ] Review results and note initial reactions (surprised? confirmed? confused?)
- [ ] Draft initial integration notes—what patterns do you see?

**Mentorship Meeting #2 (Week 5-6):**
- [ ] Bring printed assessment results to mentor meeting
- [ ] Ask: "What do you see in me that aligns or contradicts these results?"
- [ ] Discuss: "Based on my profile, what career paths should I explore?"
- [ ] Get mentor's perspective on your blind spots (external awareness)

**For Personal Development Plan (due Week 11):**
- [ ] Part 1: Summarize all 5 assessments with career implications
- [ ] Write 200-300 word integration statement identifying patterns
- [ ] Use assessments to inform SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses)
- [ ] Reference results when setting SMART goals (aligned with strengths and interests)

<speaker-notes>
Concrete action steps prevent "interesting lecture but no follow-through" syndrome. Students need clear tasks with deadlines.

**Completion deadline:** Some students procrastinate on assessments. Emphasize they MUST complete all 5 by end of Week 5 because Mentorship Meeting #2 (scheduled Week 5-6) requires discussing results. Missing this window means missing valuable mentor input for PDP.

**Assessment links reminder:**
- MBTI: 16personalities.com (free version)
- VIA: viacharacter.org (free, 15 minutes)
- CliftonStrengths: Access codes provided in course materials (30 minutes)
- Holland Code: O*NET Interest Profiler at onetonline.org (free, 10 minutes)
- EI: Link in course materials (Week 7 will cover in depth, but complete now)

**Initial reactions matter:** Before discussing with mentor, students should note gut responses. "VIA says Curiosity is my top strength—I never thought of myself as particularly curious." This creates productive conversation material for Meeting #2.

**Mentor meeting prep:** Students should submit Pre-Meeting Preparation Form 48 hours before Meeting #2. That form should include:
- "Assessment results summary" section
- Specific questions about interpreting results in career context
- Request for mentor's external perspective on student's strengths/blind spots

**PDP integration timeline:** Don't wait until Week 10 to start PDP. Begin drafting Part 1 (Self-Knowledge Foundation) this week while assessments are fresh. Week 11 deadline will be less stressful if students work incrementally.

**Canvas/LMS:** Remind students that all assessment result files should be uploaded to course management system for instructor review. This also serves as backup if they lose paper copies.

<slide number="28" title="Key Takeaways">

## Today's Key Takeaways

1. **Self-awareness has two dimensions:** Internal (knowing yourself) and External (knowing how others see you)—both are essential
2. **The Johari Window** explains why self-assessment alone isn't enough—you need feedback to reduce blind spots
3. **MBTI is popular but has weak validity**—use it as a conversation starter, not scientific truth
4. **VIA Character Strengths has strong evidence**—leverage your signature strengths in career planning
5. **CliftonStrengths has validation concerns**—prioritize VIA when results conflict; use talents language carefully
6. **Holland Code predicts satisfaction more than performance**—use it to filter career environments, not eliminate options
7. **Integration across all 5 assessments** reveals patterns and contradictions—both are valuable insights

<speaker-notes>
Summary slide for retention. These 7 takeaways capture the lecture's core messages—students should be able to explain each one.

Quick check for understanding: "Without looking at your notes, who can explain the Johari Window?" "What did the Erford study tell us about MBTI validity?" "Why do we prioritize VIA over CliftonStrengths?"

If time permits, quick pair-share: "Turn to the person next to you. In 60 seconds, explain what your Holland Code is and what it suggests about career fit."

**Connection to next week:** Week 6 is the MISA field trip—experiential learning. Students will observe workplace culture and professional behaviors. Encourage them to notice: "What Holland Code types would thrive in this environment? What CliftonStrengths would be valued? Do I see myself fitting here?" Assessment knowledge becomes observation lens.

**Longer-term connection:** Week 11 (Designing Your Development Plan) will require integrating ALL these assessments plus mentor feedback, SWOT analysis, and course learning. The work students do this week (completing assessments, discussing with mentor, drafting integration notes) directly lightens the Week 11 workload.

**Next Week:** Field Trip to MISA Company—observe how professionals use their strengths in real workplace contexts

<speaker-notes>
Optional resources for students who want to go deeper. These should NOT be mentioned as requirements—lecture and assigned readings cover assessed material.

**Why include these?** Some students develop genuine interest in personality psychology or career development and want to explore beyond course requirements. Providing curated resources prevents them from finding low-quality sources.

**Big Five recommendation:** Students who found MBTI limiting may appreciate Big Five (OCEAN model: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism). It uses continuous scales (solving MBTI's binary problem) and has stronger validity. However, it's less career-focused than Holland Code.

**Next week preview:** Brief mention of field trip primes students to approach it thoughtfully. They should observe MISA's organizational culture through the lens of this week's learning. What personality types seem to thrive there? What character strengths are valued? This connects theory to real-world observation.
