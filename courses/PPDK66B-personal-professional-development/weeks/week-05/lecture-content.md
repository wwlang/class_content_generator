# Self-Discovery Through Assessment

**Understanding yourself to design your career**

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 5. Today we explore the science of self-awareness and how validated assessment tools help you understand your personality, strengths, interests, and career fit. This is the foundation for your Personal Development Plan.

<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="Hook - Self-Knowledge Gap">

# 95%

**of people think they're self-aware**

**Only 10-15% actually are**

*(Eurich, 2017)*

<speaker-notes>
This stat typically surprises students - nearly everyone believes they know themselves well, but research shows true self-awareness is rare. This gap matters because self-awareness is the foundation of effective leadership, career satisfaction, and personal development. Today's tools help close this gap through objective assessment.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the science of self-awareness and the Johari Window framework
2. **Interpret** personality assessment results (MBTI/16 Personalities) for career insights
3. **Apply** character strengths (VIA) and talents (CliftonStrengths) to career planning
4. **Analyze** career-personality fit using Holland Code (RIASEC)
5. **Integrate** insights from multiple assessments into coherent self-understanding

<speaker-notes>
These objectives map directly to your Personal Development Plan (Assessment 3). Today you'll learn the frameworks; this week you'll complete the assessments; by Week 11 you'll synthesize them into your PDP. Emphasize that understanding these tools helps them evaluate assessment validity - a critical skill when employers or consultants claim to measure personality or potential.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You

**Personal Development Plan (40% - Due Week 11)**

- **Part 1: Self-Knowledge Foundation** requires all 5 assessments:
  - MBTI/16 Personalities
  - VIA Character Strengths
  - CliftonStrengths
  - Emotional Intelligence (covered Week 7)
  - Holland Code/RIASEC
- Today: Learn the frameworks
- This week: Complete assessments
- Meeting 2 (Weeks 4-5): Share results with mentor
- Week 11: Synthesize into comprehensive PDP

<speaker-notes>
Students often ask "Why so many assessments?" Answer: Each measures different aspects - personality types, character strengths, talent themes, interests. Multiple lenses provide richer self-understanding than any single tool. The PDP requires integration of ALL five, so completing assessments this week is critical timeline-wise.

# Part 1

## The Science of Self-Awareness

<speaker-notes>
Transition to first major section. Frame self-awareness as a scientifically measurable construct, not just pop psychology. We'll start with foundational theory before diving into specific assessment tools.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Two Dimensions of Self-Awareness">

## Two Dimensions of Self-Awareness

**Internal Self-Awareness**
Understanding your own:
- Values and beliefs
- Interests and passions
- Goals and aspirations
- Cognitive patterns and decision-making styles
- Emotional responses

**External Self-Awareness**
Understanding how others perceive your:
- Communication style
- Interpersonal behaviors
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Impact on teams and relationships

*(London, Sessa, & Shelley, 2023)*

<speaker-notes>
This framework from London et al.'s 2023 Annual Review establishes that self-awareness isn't one thing - it's both internal (knowing yourself) and external (knowing how you're perceived). Students often focus only on internal; emphasize that career success requires both. Example: You might value creativity (internal) but others perceive you as disorganized (external) - that gap needs addressing. Most assessments today measure internal awareness; peer feedback and mentorship provide external perspective.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="The Johari Window">

## The Johari Window

| | **Known to Self** | **Unknown to Self** |
|---|---|---|
| **Known to Others** | **OPEN AREA**<br>Public knowledge | **BLIND SPOT**<br>Others see it, you don't |
| **Unknown to Others** | **HIDDEN AREA**<br>Private knowledge | **UNKNOWN AREA**<br>Undiscovered potential |

**Career development goal:** Expand the Open Area

*(Luft & Ingham, 1955)*

<speaker-notes>
The Johari Window is one of psychology's most practical frameworks. Walk through each quadrant with examples: Open Area = skills on your resume that interview confirms; Blind Spot = "you interrupt people" feedback you didn't realize; Hidden Area = your imposter syndrome you don't share; Unknown Area = talents you haven't discovered yet. Career development expands the Open Area by: (1) Sharing Hidden info (self-disclosure), (2) Seeking feedback to reduce Blind Spots, (3) Trying new experiences to discover Unknown potential. Today's assessments help with all three.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Why Self-Knowledge Asymmetry Matters">

## The Self-Other Knowledge Asymmetry

**Research finding:** Young adults have biased views of their abilities

**Study of 448 adolescents found:**
- **Open Area:** Numerical intelligence - self and others agree
- **Blind Spot:** Verbal intelligence - others rate students higher than they rate themselves
- **Hidden Area:** Intrapersonal competence - students know this better than observers
- **Unknown Area:** Spatial ability - neither self nor others accurately predict performance

**Implication:** Professional assessment is essential, not optional

*(Neubauer et al., 2018)*

<speaker-notes>
This 2018 study empirically tests the Johari Window with undergraduate-age students - your audience. Key insight: Students systematically misjudge their own abilities in predictable ways. They underestimate verbal skills (impostor syndrome) and struggle to assess spatial/creative abilities without testing. This validates why we're using multiple validated assessments rather than just "reflect on your strengths." Students typically ask "Does this apply in Vietnam?" - research is Austrian sample, but self-assessment bias appears cross-culturally.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Four Processes of Self-Awareness Development">

## How to Develop Self-Awareness

| Process | Definition | Career Outcome |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Reflection** | Continuous self-learning from experience | Adaptive development |
| **Rumination** | Threat-motivated repetitive thinking | Anxiety, avoidance ❌ |
| **Metacognition** | Awareness of thought patterns | Strategic thinking |
| **Mindfulness** | Present-moment awareness without judgment | Emotional regulation |

**Key insight:** Reflection and metacognition improve self-awareness; rumination undermines it

*(London et al., 2023)*

<speaker-notes>
Distinguish reflection (constructive: "What can I learn from this mistake?") from rumination (destructive: "Why am I so stupid?"). Students often confuse the two. Reflection is forward-looking and learning-focused; rumination is backward-looking and self-critical. Metacognition means noticing your thought patterns - "I tend to catastrophize under pressure" - which allows you to adjust. Mindfulness helps you observe emotions without being controlled by them. Connect to Week 3's reflective learning: Gibbs and Kolb cycles are structured reflection tools.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="The Dark Side of Self-Awareness">

## Warning: The Dark Side of Introspection

**Excessive self-focus can lead to:**
- Narcissistic patterns - overestimating uniqueness and importance
- Paralysis by analysis - unable to make decisions
- Self-absorption - reduced empathy for others
- Rumination loops - dwelling on problems without action

**Balance needed:**
- Self-awareness ≠ self-obsession
- Combine internal reflection with external feedback
- Move from insight to action (don't stop at understanding)

*(London et al., 2023)*

<speaker-notes>
Important caution that students rarely hear: self-awareness can go too far. Some students become so focused on "finding themselves" that they never take action. Others use self-knowledge as an excuse ("I'm an introvert so I can't network"). Emphasize balance: use assessments for insight, then apply that insight through action. Your PDP must include concrete goals and action steps, not just self-description. Mentorship provides the external perspective that prevents navel-gazing.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="12" layout="section-break" title="Part 2 - Personality & Type">

# Part 2

## Personality & Type

**MBTI/16 Personalities Framework**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to second major section. Students are often familiar with MBTI from social media (16personalities.com is hugely popular) but lack understanding of the theory or validity. We'll provide both the framework and critical evaluation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="What is Personality Type?">

## What is Personality Type?

**Personality type theory** suggests people have:
- Innate preferences (not learned behaviors)
- Consistent patterns across situations
- Categorical differences (types, not just traits)

**Most popular framework:** Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
- Based on Carl Jung's psychological types (1921)
- Developed by Myers & Briggs (1940s-1960s)
- 16 types based on 4 dichotomies
- Most widely used personality assessment in professional contexts

**Free alternative:** 16Personalities.com (MBTI-inspired)

<speaker-notes>
Distinguish type theory (MBTI) from trait theory (Big Five). Type theory says you're either Extraverted OR Introverted; trait theory says you're somewhere on a spectrum. MBTI remains massively popular in business despite academic criticism - students will encounter it in job interviews, team-building workshops, and career counseling. 16Personalities.com uses MBTI letter code but measures traits, not types (technically it's a hybrid). For this course, students can use the free version for self-exploration.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="The Four MBTI Dichotomies">

## The Four MBTI Dichotomies

| Dichotomy | Preference | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Energy** | **E**xtraversion vs. **I**ntroversion | Where you direct energy: outer world vs. inner world |
| **Information** | **S**ensing vs. I**n**tuition | How you take in information: concrete facts vs. patterns/possibilities |
| **Decisions** | **T**hinking vs. **F**eeling | How you make decisions: logic/analysis vs. values/impact on people |
| **Lifestyle** | **J**udging vs. **P**erceiving | How you approach life: structure/planning vs. flexibility/spontaneity |

**Combination creates 16 types:** INTJ, ESFP, ENFP, ISTJ, etc.

**Example:** INTJ = Introversion + Intuition + Thinking + Judging

<speaker-notes>
Walk through each dichotomy with clear examples. Energy: Extraverts gain energy from social interaction (recharged by people); Introverts need alone time to recharge (drained by too much socializing). Information: Sensors trust concrete data and past experience; Intuitives look for patterns and future possibilities. Decisions: Thinkers prioritize logical consistency; Feelers consider impact on people and values. Lifestyle: Judgers prefer plans and closure; Perceivers prefer flexibility and open options. Emphasize these are preferences, not abilities - an Introvert CAN socialize effectively; they just find it more draining than an Extravert.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="Example - INTJ Profile">

## Example: The INTJ Profile

**INTJ = "Architect" or "Mastermind"**

**Preferences:**
- **I**ntroversion - Energized by solitary analysis
- I**n**tuition - Focuses on patterns, theories, future possibilities
- **T**hinking - Decisions based on logic and objective criteria
- **J**udging - Prefers structure, planning, and closure

**Strengths:** Strategic thinking, independent, innovative, decisive
**Challenges:** May appear aloof, impatient with inefficiency, perfectionist
**Career fit:** Strategy consultant, engineer, research scientist, analyst

**Famous INTJs:** Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jane Austen

<speaker-notes>
Use INTJ as concrete example. INTJs are rare (2-4% of population) but overrepresented in business school. Characteristics: loves systems thinking, sees patterns others miss, values competence above all, can seem cold or critical. Career implications: thrives in roles requiring strategic planning and autonomy; struggles in highly social or unstructured environments. Emphasize this is just an example - all 16 types have value in different contexts. Students should not stereotype themselves or others based on type.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Critical Evaluation - MBTI Validity">

## The Evidence Question: Is MBTI Valid?

**2025 Comprehensive Review** analyzed 193 studies (1999-2024):

**✓ What MBTI does well:**
- Internal consistency: α = 0.845-0.921 (good reliability)
- Stable across time (test-retest reliability)
- Popular - most used assessment in career counseling

**❌ Concerns about validity:**
- Weak convergent validity: Only 2.8% of correlations with other personality measures reached meaningful levels (r ≥ 0.50)
- Poor predictive validity for career outcomes: Only 0.5% of career-related correlations reached r ≥ 0.50
- Binary typing problem: Forces continuous traits into either/or categories

*(Erford et al., 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
This is the most current (2025) and comprehensive MBTI review available - open access in Journal of Counseling & Development. Key message: MBTI is reliable (consistent results) but validity is questionable (doesn't predict what it claims to predict). The binary typing issue is major: Most people are near the middle on dimensions (e.g., 55% Extravert, 45% Introvert) but MBTI forces them into E or I category, losing nuance. Despite limitations, MBTI remains useful for self-exploration and conversation, just not for major career decisions. Students should take results as "food for thought" not as definitive truth.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="How to Use MBTI Results Wisely">

## How to Use MBTI Results Wisely

**DO:**
- Explore preferences and patterns in your behavior
- Use as conversation starter with mentor or peers
- Consider how type preferences affect teamwork
- Recognize strengths associated with your type

**DON'T:**
- Make major career decisions based solely on type
- Use type as excuse ("I'm an introvert so I can't lead")
- Stereotype others based on their type
- Assume type is fixed and unchangeable

**Remember:** MBTI measures *preferences*, not *abilities*

You can develop skills outside your natural preferences!

<speaker-notes>
Practical guidance for students. The value of MBTI is in self-reflection and understanding behavioral preferences, not in limiting yourself. Example: An ISTJ preference suggests you like structure and details, but you can absolutely learn creative thinking - it might just require more deliberate effort. Conversely, don't force yourself into careers that consistently violate your preferences - an Introvert working in constant high-stimulus environments may burn out. The key is awareness and intentional development, not determinism.

<slide number="18" layout="section-break" title="Part 3 - Strengths & Talents">

# Part 3

## Strengths & Talents

**VIA Character Strengths & CliftonStrengths**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to third major section. Shift from personality TYPE (which you're born with) to CHARACTER STRENGTHS (which you can develop). Strengths-based approaches focus on amplifying what you do well rather than fixing weaknesses.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="The VIA Character Strengths Framework">

## VIA Character Strengths: The Science

**VIA = Values in Action**

Developed by 55 psychologists over 3 years (2001-2004), reviewed:
- Philosophy and religious texts across cultures
- Psychological research on virtues
- Cross-cultural universals in valued character traits

**Result:** 24 character strengths organized into 6 virtues

**Why it matters:**
- Using signature strengths daily → higher life satisfaction
- Strengths-based interventions improve well-being
- Free validated assessment: www.viacharacter.org

*(Peterson & Seligman, 2004)*

<speaker-notes>
VIA is the "backbone of positive psychology" - the most rigorous classification of human character strengths. Unlike personality (relatively stable), character strengths can be deliberately developed. The research found remarkable cross-cultural agreement on which traits are valued: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, transcendence appear across every major culture and philosophy. VIA survey takes 15 minutes and provides rank order of all 24 strengths. Students should take it this week for their PDP.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="framework" title="The 24 VIA Character Strengths">

## The 24 VIA Character Strengths

| Virtue | Character Strengths |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Wisdom** | Creativity • Curiosity • Judgment • Love of Learning • Perspective |
| **Courage** | Bravery • Perseverance • Honesty • Zest |
| **Humanity** | Love • Kindness • Social Intelligence |
| **Justice** | Teamwork • Fairness • Leadership |
| **Temperance** | Forgiveness • Humility • Prudence • Self-Regulation |
| **Transcendence** | Appreciation of Beauty • Gratitude • Hope • Humor • Spirituality |

**Your "Signature Strengths" = Top 5-7 strengths**

These are the strengths that:
- Feel authentic and natural to you
- Energize you when you use them
- You actively seek opportunities to express

<speaker-notes>
Display all 24 strengths so students see the full framework. Signature strengths (top 5-7) are those that feel "essentially you" - using them is energizing, not draining. Research shows you should "lean in" to signature strengths rather than trying to be well-rounded across all 24. Example: If Creativity and Curiosity are your top strengths, seek roles that require innovation and learning, rather than highly routine work. Students often ask "Can strengths change?" - yes, but slowly; signature strengths tend to be stable but can evolve with life experience. Lesser strengths can be developed if needed for specific goals.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="Applying VIA to Career Development">

## Strengths-Based Career Counseling (SBCC)

**Research study:** VIA-based career intervention with job seekers

**4-Session Model:**
1. **Strengths Identification** - Complete VIA, identify top 5
2. **Strengths Exploration** - Discuss how strengths show up in life
3. **Goal-Setting** - Set career goals aligned with strengths
4. **Application** - Create action plans using strengths

**Results at 3-month follow-up:**
- **SBCC group:** 80% employment rate
- **Control group:** 60% employment rate
- **Self-esteem:** Significant gains only in SBCC group

*(Littman-Ovadia et al., 2014)*

<speaker-notes>
This Israeli study demonstrates that strengths-based approaches work - they're not just feel-good psychology. The SBCC intervention helped job seekers identify careers that aligned with their character strengths, leading to higher placement rates and confidence. Key insight for students: Don't just list strengths on your resume; actively seek roles where you can use them daily. Your PDP should explicitly connect signature strengths to career goals. Students should discuss VIA results with mentor in Meeting 2 (Weeks 4-5) to explore how strengths show up professionally.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="CliftonStrengths Approach">

## CliftonStrengths: Talent Themes

**Different from VIA:** Focuses on talents (natural patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving) rather than moral character

**34 Talent Themes** across 4 domains:
- **Executing:** Getting things done (Achiever, Discipline, Focus, Responsibility)
- **Influencing:** Taking charge and speaking up (Command, Communication, Competition)
- **Relationship Building:** Connecting with others (Empathy, Harmony, Relator)
- **Strategic Thinking:** Absorbing and analyzing information (Analytical, Learner, Strategic)

**Philosophy:** Invest in developing your top talents into strengths, rather than fixing weaknesses

*(Gallup/CliftonStrengths)*

<speaker-notes>
CliftonStrengths (formerly StrengthsFinder) is popular in corporate settings - many employers use it for team development. Key difference from VIA: CliftonStrengths measures innate talents and behavioral patterns, while VIA measures character virtues. Example: CliftonStrengths "Achiever" = driven to accomplish things; VIA "Perseverance" = moral commitment to finish what you start. Both useful, different lenses. Students receive access code for assessment in course materials. Results show top 5 themes (paid version shows all 34 ranked).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Critical Note on CliftonStrengths">

## A Note on Psychometric Validity

**Recent research caution (Reid & Short, 2024):**

Study examined CliftonStrengths reliability in college students:
- Less than half of 34 themes showed adequate internal consistency (α ≥ 0.70)
- Only 8 of 34 themes showed adequate reliability in college student samples
- Authors conclude: "Evidence for implementing CSA in higher education is insufficient"

**Our approach:**
- Use CliftonStrengths conceptually to explore talents
- Rely more heavily on VIA (better validated, free)
- Teach students to critically evaluate assessment claims

**Key lesson:** Popular ≠ Valid. Always examine the evidence.

<speaker-notes>
Important to teach critical evaluation, not blind acceptance. CliftonStrengths is widely used in business but the psychometric evidence is weaker than VIA's, especially for college students. The 2024 study found many themes lacked reliability - meaning inconsistent results across time. Despite this, the framework is useful for conversation and self-exploration; just don't make major decisions based on it alone. Emphasize scientific literacy: "When someone claims to measure your personality or potential, ask: What's the evidence? What are the reliability and validity coefficients? Has it been validated in populations like me?" This critical thinking skill is valuable for evaluating any assessment they encounter in their careers.

# Part 4

## Career-Personality Fit

**Holland Code (RIASEC) Theory**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to fourth and final major section. We've covered personality type and character strengths; now we connect these to career choice through vocational interests. Holland's RIASEC theory is the most influential career development framework in existence.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Holland's RIASEC Theory">

## Holland's Theory of Vocational Personalities

**Core premise:** Career satisfaction results from alignment between:
1. **Person:** Your interests, abilities, values
2. **Environment:** The demands and culture of the work setting

**RIASEC Model:** Six personality types and corresponding work environments

**Career development goal:** Find "congruence" (good fit)

**Most widely used theory in career counseling** - 50+ years of research

*(Holland, 1959-1997; Nauta, 2010)*

<speaker-notes>
John Holland's theory revolutionized career counseling by providing a systematic framework for person-environment fit. The key insight: Career satisfaction comes not from finding the "best" career (doesn't exist) but from finding careers that match your personality. Someone with a Realistic personality (hands-on, mechanical) will be miserable in a purely Social environment (teaching, counseling) and vice versa. The theory is 50 years old but remains the foundation of virtually all career assessment tools. O*NET Interest Profiler (free online) is based on Holland's model.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="framework" title="The Six RIASEC Types">

## The Six RIASEC Types

| Type | Personality | Preferred Work | Example Careers |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **R**ealistic | Practical, hands-on, mechanical | Working with tools, machines, objects | Engineer, mechanic, pilot |
| **I**nvestigative | Analytical, curious, intellectual | Research, problem-solving, ideas | Scientist, analyst, programmer |
| **A**rtistic | Creative, expressive, original | Innovation, self-expression, aesthetics | Designer, writer, musician |
| **S**ocial | Helpful, cooperative, empathetic | Teaching, helping, serving others | Teacher, counselor, nurse |
| **E**nterprising | Persuasive, ambitious, leader | Influencing, selling, leading | Manager, entrepreneur, lawyer |
| **C**onventional | Organized, detail-oriented, structured | Data, systems, procedures | Accountant, administrator, analyst |

**Your Holland Code = Top 3 types** (e.g., ASE, IEC, RIC)

<speaker-notes>
Walk through each type with clear examples. Realistic = "doers" who like tangible results; Investigative = "thinkers" who like intellectual challenges; Artistic = "creators" who value originality; Social = "helpers" who focus on people; Enterprising = "persuaders" who enjoy influence and risk; Conventional = "organizers" who value structure and accuracy. Most people are combinations - your top 3 letters form your Holland Code. Example: ASE = Artistic primary (creative), Social secondary (people-oriented), Enterprising tertiary (leadership) → might suit marketing creative director or social entrepreneur roles.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="framework" title="The RIASEC Hexagon">

## The RIASEC Hexagonal Model

```
        R
      /   \
    C       I
    |       |
    E       A
      \   /
        S
```

**Adjacency = Similarity**
- Adjacent types (e.g., R-I, A-S) are more compatible
- Opposite types (e.g., R-S, I-E) are most different
- Your Holland Code predicts career compatibility

**Example:** RIC (Realistic-Investigative-Conventional)
- Adjacent types = consistent, focused interests
- Engineering or data science likely good fit

<speaker-notes>
The hexagon shows relationships between types. Adjacent types share characteristics: Realistic-Investigative both prefer working with things/ideas over people; Artistic-Social both value personal expression/helping. Opposite types have contrasting values: Realistic (concrete, practical) vs. Social (abstract, interpersonal); Investigative (contemplative) vs. Enterprising (action-oriented). Your Holland Code's "consistency" matters - adjacent codes (like RIC: Realistic-Investigative-Conventional, all on right side of hexagon) suggest focused interests; opposite codes (like RAE: all over hexagon) suggest varied interests but potential internal conflict about career direction.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="28" title="Evidence for Person-Environment Fit">

## Does Congruence Predict Satisfaction?

**Meta-analytic evidence:**

Person-environment congruence correlates with:
- Job satisfaction: **r = .17** (Tsabari et al., 2005)
- Performance: **r = .15** (Tranberg et al., 1993)
- Stability: **r = .10** (Assouline & Meir, 1987)

**Interpretation:**
- Modest but consistent effects
- Not deterministic - other factors matter (salary, manager, life stage)
- BUT: Persistent misalignment predicts burnout and turnover
- Better to be "in the ballpark" than completely misaligned

*(Meta-analyses reviewed in Nauta, 2010)*

<speaker-notes>
Students often expect stronger correlations. Frame r = .17 as meaningful in context: Career satisfaction is influenced by many factors (pay, manager, life stage, economy), so no single factor explains everything. Holland fit explains about 3% of variance (r² = .03) - small but consistent across decades and cultures. More importantly: Large mismatches predict problems. If you're strongly Social but work in pure Realistic environment (construction site, factory floor), you'll likely feel misaligned. Don't expect Holland Code to "tell you what to do," but use it to rule out poor fits and identify promising directions worth exploring.

<slide number="29" title="Holland Code in Practice">

## Using Holland Code for Career Exploration

**Step 1:** Complete O*NET Interest Profiler (free)
- www.onetonline.org → Interest Profiler
- 60 questions, ~10 minutes
- Receive your 3-letter Holland Code

**Step 2:** Explore matching careers
- O*NET database links codes to ~900 occupations
- See job descriptions, education requirements, salary outlook

**Step 3:** Discuss with mentor
- Share code and initial reactions
- Explore alignment with current career direction
- Identify careers to research further

**Your PDP must include Holland Code results and career field alignment analysis**

<speaker-notes>
Practical implementation instructions. O*NET Interest Profiler is US Department of Labor's free tool - high quality, easy to use. After getting Holland Code, students should explore 5-10 matching careers even if they think they already know what they want - often discover options they hadn't considered. Example: ASE code includes not just traditional arts careers but also marketing, UX design, organizational development - business-relevant roles. Students should bring results to Mentorship Meeting 2 (Weeks 4-5) to discuss alignment. If there's a mismatch between Holland Code and stated career goal, doesn't mean goal is wrong - but worth exploring why the mismatch and whether it's sustainable long-term.

# Integration

## Synthesizing Multiple Assessments

<speaker-notes>
Final section focuses on integration - the PDP requires students to synthesize insights from MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, Holland Code, and EI (Week 7). This is the most challenging and important task.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="31" title="Why Multiple Assessments?">

## Why Five Different Assessments?

Each measures a different facet of self-understanding:

| Assessment | What It Measures | Career Application |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **MBTI/16P** | Personality preferences | Work style, team role, environment fit |
| **VIA** | Character strengths | Values alignment, source of meaning |
| **CliftonStrengths** | Natural talents | Where you excel most naturally |
| **Holland Code** | Vocational interests | Career field fit, tasks you enjoy |
| **EI** (Week 7) | Emotional intelligence | Leadership, relationships, self-management |

**Together:** Comprehensive self-portrait for career planning

<speaker-notes>
Students sometimes feel overwhelmed by five assessments - this slide explains the rationale. Each provides a different lens: MBTI = how you process information and make decisions; VIA = what gives you meaning and fulfillment; CliftonStrengths = what you naturally do well; Holland = what kinds of work you're drawn to; EI = how you manage yourself and relationships. A career that aligns with only one or two will be less sustainable than one that aligns with most. Example: You might have Strong Investigative interests (Holland) but if you're also ENFP (Extravert-Feeling), pure lab research might feel isolating - you'd thrive more in collaborative research or research-to-practice translation roles.

## Integration Strategy: Look for Patterns

**Ask yourself:**

**Confirming patterns:**
- What themes appear across multiple assessments?
- Which results feel most accurate and energizing?
- Where do assessments point to similar career directions?

**Contradictions:**
- Where do results seem to conflict?
- Which conflicts are surface-level vs. fundamental?
- Do contradictions suggest versatility or internal conflict?

**Gaps:**
- What aspects of yourself are NOT captured by these assessments?
- What do you know about yourself that tests didn't reveal?
- What feedback from others contradicts your self-assessments?

<speaker-notes>
This is the core analytical work for the PDP. Confirming patterns = high confidence insights. Example: If you're INTJ (Introvert-Thinking), top VIA strength is Judgment, top CliftonStrengths is Analytical, and Holland Code is I (Investigative), that's a powerful convergent pattern pointing toward research, analysis, strategy roles. Contradictions need exploration: Some are resolvable (ENFP + Investigative interests = collaborative research); others indicate internal tensions (Social interests + extreme Introversion = need to find helping roles that don't require constant interaction). Gaps are crucial - assessments can't measure ambition, resilience, specific skills, cultural identity, family obligations, etc. Your PDP must integrate assessment data with lived experience.

## Sample Integration: "Sarah's Profile"

**MBTI:** ENFP (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving)
**VIA Top 5:** Creativity, Curiosity, Social Intelligence, Zest, Kindness
**CliftonStrengths Top 5:** Ideation, Strategic, Learner, Positivity, Woo
**Holland Code:** AES (Artistic, Enterprising, Social)

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Strong creative and people orientation across all assessments
- Values innovation, learning, and helping others
- Energized by variety and interpersonal interaction

**Career Alignment:**
✓ Marketing strategist for social impact organizations
✓ Innovation consultant for nonprofits
✓ Learning & development leader
✗ Accounting, routine administration, solo technical work

<speaker-notes>
Concrete example helps students visualize integration. "Sarah" shows strong convergence: ENFP personality (creative, people-oriented, flexible) aligns with VIA (Creativity, Social Intelligence) and CliftonStrengths (Ideation, Strategic, Woo=winning others over) and Holland Code (Artistic, Social). This consistency suggests Sarah will thrive in creative, people-facing, dynamic environments with social impact. Misaligned careers would drain her: routine work (violates N preference for novelty), solo work (violates E and S preferences), highly structured environments (violates P preference for flexibility). Students should create similar analysis in their PDP Part 1: Self-Knowledge Foundation.

<slide number="34" title="PDP Integration Requirements">

## Your PDP Integration Statement

**Part 1 of Personal Development Plan requires:**

**200-300 word Integration Statement** addressing:
1. What consistent themes emerge across all 5 assessments?
2. How do these assessments collectively inform your career direction?
3. Where do you see alignments vs. contradictions?
4. What do these results confirm or challenge about your self-perception?
5. How does this integrated self-understanding shape your 1-3-5 year goals?

**This is worth 20% of your PDP grade** - invest time in thoughtful synthesis

<speaker-notes>
Emphasize that the Integration Statement is one of the most important sections of the PDP - it demonstrates critical thinking and self-awareness, not just completion of assessments. Strong statements identify patterns ("All assessments suggest I thrive in structured environments with clear expectations"), explain contradictions ("My Artistic interests seem to conflict with my Conventional Holland Code, but I realize I'm creative within systems - like designing efficient processes"), and draw career implications ("This suggests I should seek project management roles in creative industries rather than pure artist or pure administrator roles"). Weak statements just list results without synthesis. Students should draft this iteratively, revisiting after each new assessment.

<slide number="35" title="From Assessment to Action">

## From Self-Knowledge to Career Strategy

**Self-assessment answers:** "Who am I?"

**Career planning answers:** "Where am I going?"

**Development plan answers:** "How will I get there?"

**Your PDP synthesizes all three:**
- Self-assessment insights (Part 1) →
- SWOT analysis & skills gaps (Part 2) →
- Vision & SMART goals (Part 3) →
- Action timeline & accountability (Part 5)

**Assessments are the foundation, not the destination.**

<speaker-notes>
Crucial conceptual point: Self-assessment is the beginning, not the end. Students sometimes get stuck in the "self-discovery" phase and never move to action. The PDP deliberately structures movement from understanding (Parts 1-2) to planning (Part 3) to implementation (Part 5). Assessments inform but don't determine your path - YOU decide based on self-knowledge plus external factors (market opportunities, education needed, family considerations, etc.). Quote from London et al. (2023): "Self-aware leaders don't just know themselves; they use that knowledge strategically." Your goal is actionable self-awareness.

<slide number="36" title="This Week's Action Steps">

## This Week: Complete Your Assessments

**By end of Week 5, complete ALL assessments:**

✓ **MBTI/16 Personalities** - www.16personalities.com (free, 10-15 min)

✓ **VIA Character Strengths** - www.viacharacter.org (free, 15 min)

✓ **CliftonStrengths** - Use access code from course materials (20 min)

✓ **Holland Code** - O*NET Interest Profiler, www.onetonline.org (10 min)

✓ **EI Assessment** - Will be assigned Week 7

**Save your results!** You'll need them for:
- Mentorship Meeting 2 discussion
- PDP Part 1: Self-Knowledge Foundation
- Oral Exam presentation

<speaker-notes>
Clear action steps. Students should block 60-90 minutes this week to complete all four assessments currently due (EI comes later). Emphasize saving full reports, not just screenshotting top results - they'll need details for PDP analysis. Mentorship Meeting 2 (Weeks 4-5) is the ideal time to discuss results with mentor and get external perspective on whether assessments align with how mentor perceives them. This provides valuable Johari Window "Blind Spot" insights. Some students ask if they can complete assessments during class - no, need focused attention at home for valid results.

<slide number="37" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

**1. Self-awareness is rare but developable** - Most people overestimate their self-knowledge; validated assessments provide objective insights

**2. Multiple lenses provide richer understanding** - MBTI (personality), VIA (character), CliftonStrengths (talents), Holland (interests) each capture different aspects

**3. Validity matters** - Popular assessments aren't always scientifically sound; evaluate evidence critically

**4. Person-environment fit predicts satisfaction** - Career success requires alignment between who you are and what your work demands

**5. Integration is key** - Look for patterns across assessments; synthesize into coherent self-understanding

**6. Assessment is the beginning, not the end** - Use insights to inform action, not as excuse for inaction

<speaker-notes>
Synthesize the lecture's main messages. These six takeaways should stick with students beyond the exam. Emphasize the progression: (1) self-awareness is hard but learnable, (2) use multiple tools for comprehensive view, (3) not all tools are equal - check the evidence, (4) fit matters more than finding "the best" career, (5) synthesis across assessments reveals deeper truths than any single test, (6) knowledge without action is useless - apply what you learn. Students who master these principles will make better career decisions throughout their lives, not just for their first job.

<slide number="38" title="Assessment Connection Revisited">

## Looking Ahead: PDP Timeline

**Week 5 (This week):** Complete all four self-assessments

**Weeks 4-5 (Meeting 2):** Discuss assessment results with mentor

**Week 7:** Complete Emotional Intelligence assessment, continue PDP drafting

**Weeks 7-8 (Meeting 3):** Share SWOT analysis and preliminary goals with mentor

**Week 10-11 (Meeting 4):** Present draft PDP to mentor for feedback

**Week 11 (Nov 28):** Submit final Personal Development Plan

**Remember:** Evidence of mentor feedback integration is worth 20% of PDP grade

<speaker-notes>
Reinforce the PDP timeline so students see how this week's work connects to upcoming deliverables. Completing assessments this week is non-negotiable - they need results for Meeting 2 with mentor. Students who procrastinate will have weaker PDPs because they won't have time for thoughtful integration or mentor feedback incorporation. The 20% for mentor integration incentivizes starting early and engaging authentically with the mentorship process. Students should schedule Meeting 2 soon if they haven't already - it should happen in next 1-2 weeks to stay on track.

<slide number="39" title="Next Week Preview">

## Next Week: Field Trip to MISA Company

**September 18, 2025** - Experiential learning week

**What to expect:**
- Company tour and workplace observation
- Panel discussion with MISA professionals
- Q&A about career paths in tech/business
- Reflection activity using Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

**How to prepare:**
- Complete self-assessments THIS week so you can observe how different personality types show up in workplace
- Review Week 3 reflective frameworks (Gibbs, Kolb)
- Prepare 3-5 thoughtful questions about careers and workplace culture
- Bring notebook for observations - you'll use these for your Reflective Essay

**This is a MANDATORY event** - attendance required for Individual Assignment

<speaker-notes>
Preview next week to help students prepare. The field trip to MISA (a major Vietnamese tech company) is the first of two experiential learning events (the second is Ms. Ha Linh's guest speaker session Week 10). Both are mandatory and form the basis for the 10% Reflective Essay. Students should come prepared to observe actively - notice workplace culture, communication patterns, how people with different strengths/personalities contribute. Having completed self-assessments helps them see diversity of types and strengths in professional settings. Practical: Confirm transportation details, dress code (business casual), and timing. Students should bring questions - this is networking opportunity with professionals who might become future mentors or employers.
