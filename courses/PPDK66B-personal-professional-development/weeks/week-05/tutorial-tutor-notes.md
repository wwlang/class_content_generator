**Core Activity:** Integrating VIA, Holland Code, and personality assessments to generate career hypotheses

---

## Pre-Tutorial Preparation

### Materials Checklist
- [ ] Printed Integration Worksheets (one per student, or share digital version)
- [ ] Backup device with internet access for students who haven't completed assessments
- [ ] Timer or phone for peer feedback timing
- [ ] Access to O*NET database (onetonline.org) for demonstration
- [ ] Whiteboard/screen for displaying framework convergence examples

### Student Preparation Verification
Students should arrive having completed:
1. **VIA Character Strengths Survey** (viacharacter.org) – results printout or screenshot
2. **O*NET Interest Profiler** (onetonline.org) – Holland Code results
3. **Optional:** 16Personalities or similar personality assessment

**Action if unprepared:** Have 2-3 backup devices available. Students without results can complete assessments during first 15 minutes while others start integration worksheet (adjust timing accordingly).

### Tutor Preparation
1. **Complete assessments yourself** – You'll be more effective helping students interpret results if you've experienced the process
2. **Review research articles** – Skim London et al. (2023) self-awareness dimensions, Erford et al. (2025) MBTI validity findings
3. **Prepare O*NET demonstration** – Be ready to show how to search O*NET by Holland Code
4. **Anticipate common issues** – See "Common Student Challenges" section below

## Valid Approaches & Expected Outcomes

### Part 1: Individual Integration (20 minutes)

#### Valid Approaches to Convergence Analysis

**Approach 1: Direct Overlap**
- Student identifies that VIA "Curiosity" + Holland "Investigative" + Big Five "High Openness" all point to intellectual exploration
- **This is excellent** – clear pattern across frameworks

**Approach 2: Thematic Clustering**
- Student notices VIA strengths (Teamwork, Kindness, Social Intelligence) + Holland "Social" + MBTI "Extraversion/Feeling" all relate to people-orientation
- **This is excellent** – recognizing higher-level themes

**Approach 3: Career-Centric**
- Student works backward: "All my results suggest I'd thrive in consulting" and then explains why each framework supports this
- **This is acceptable** – though ensure they're not confirmation bias (fitting results to pre-existing career preference)

**Approach 4: Contradiction Exploration**
- Student focuses on where frameworks disagree: "VIA says I'm high in Leadership, but Holland Code is Investigative (solitary), not Enterprising (leadership)"
- **This is valuable** – contradictions reveal areas needing deeper exploration

#### Invalid Approaches (Redirect)

**Invalid: Pure Description Without Integration**
- Student lists all results but doesn't identify patterns or connections
- **Redirect:** "I see you've listed your results. Now let's look for themes—do any of these strengths or interests appear in multiple frameworks?"

**Invalid: Dismissing Frameworks That Don't Fit**
- Student says, "My MBTI says I'm Introverted but I don't believe that, so I'm ignoring it"
- **Redirect:** "Interesting discrepancy. What might explain the difference between the assessment and your self-perception? Could this be a blind spot, or might the assessment be missing context?"

**Invalid: Over-Reliance on One Framework**
- Student bases all career hypotheses solely on Holland Code, ignoring VIA and personality results
- **Redirect:** "Your Holland Code is one important input. How do your VIA strengths and personality results support or challenge these career directions?"

#### Expected Outcomes: Career Hypotheses

Students should generate **5-10 career directions** that align with convergent patterns. Quality indicators:

**Strong Career Hypothesis:**
- **Specific:** "Strategy consultant" not just "business"
- **Evidence-based:** Explicitly connects to 2+ assessment frameworks
- **Testable:** Student can identify ways to gain experience (internship, project, informational interview)

**Example of Strong Hypothesis:**
> "Research analyst in market research firm – supported by Holland Code Investigative, VIA Curiosity + Judgment + Analytical, Big Five High Openness. Testable through: informational interview with market research professional, data analysis project in coursework."

**Weak Career Hypothesis:**
- **Vague:** "Something creative"
- **Unsupported:** No connection to assessment results
- **Untestable:** No clear path to gain experience

### Part 2: Peer Feedback Exchange (30 minutes)

#### Valid Feedback Approaches

**Approach 1: Confirmatory Observation**
- "I've noticed you're always the one organizing group projects and making sure everyone's included. That really aligns with your VIA Leadership and Teamwork strengths."
- **This is excellent** – provides external validation of internal assessment

**Approach 2: Blind Spot Revelation**
- "You said you're not creative, but I remember your marketing campaign idea in BUS101 was really innovative. Maybe your Creativity VIA result is more accurate than you think?"
- **This is excellent** – helps partner see strengths they discount

**Approach 3: Constructive Challenge**
- "You're planning to pursue finance, but all your results point toward Social/people work. What draws you to finance specifically?"
- **This is valuable** – respectful questioning that encourages reflection

**Approach 4: Career Suggestion Based on Observation**
- "Have you thought about HR or organizational development? When we worked together last semester, you were really good at mediating our team conflict."
- **This is valuable** – external perspective on career fit

#### Invalid Feedback (Intervene)

**Invalid: Generic Praise**
- "You're great! You could do anything!"
- **Intervene:** Model specific feedback: "What specifically have you observed about [student's] work style or strengths?"

**Invalid: Projection**
- "I want to do marketing, so you should too since we're similar."
- **Intervene:** "Remember, we're helping each other discover individual patterns, not assuming everyone should follow the same path."

**Invalid: Criticism Without Construction**
- "I think you're wrong about your strengths. You're not actually that creative."
- **Intervene:** "Let's focus on what you observe, not judgments. Instead: 'I've seen you approach problems logically. How does that connect to your results?'"

#### Monitoring Feedback Quality

Circulate during peer exchanges. Listen for:
- **Positive signs:** Specific examples, thoughtful questions, balanced perspective
- **Red flags:** One partner dominating, generic praise, uncomfortable silence

**If you observe problems:**
- **Dominating partner:** Politely interrupt: "Let's make sure both partners get equal time. [Name], what questions do you have for [partner]?"
- **Surface-level exchange:** Join conversation briefly: "What specific example from working together comes to mind when you think about [partner's] strengths?"
- **Discomfort with directness:** Reassure: "Feedback is a gift that helps us see our blind spots. Let's focus on observations, not judgments."

### Part 3: Action Planning (25 minutes)

#### Valid Action Plans

**Quality Indicators:**
1. **Specific:** "Interview Ms. Nguyen, Marketing Manager at Vinamilk" not "talk to someone in marketing"
2. **Feasible:** Actions achievable within semester timeframe
3. **Testable:** Clear success criteria ("Complete 2 informational interviews by end of October")

**Strong Action Plan Example:**

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Priority Career** | Product Manager in tech |
| **Informational Interviews** | 1) Alumni from IBD working at FPT (contact via LinkedIn)<br>2) Professor's industry contact at Tiki |
| **Direct Experience** | Product management project in MKT301 next semester |
| **Skill Development** | 1) Learn Figma (online course)<br>2) Develop SQL skills (DataCamp)<br>3) Practice user research methods |
| **Accountability** | Partner check-in via WeChat every two weeks; first interview completed by Oct 15 |

**Weak Action Plan (Redirect):**

| Problem | Example | Redirect Strategy |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Too vague** | "Get an internship somewhere" | "Which specific companies or roles align with your priority career? Let's identify 3-5 target organizations." |
| **Unrealistic** | "Interview 10 executives this month" | "Starting with 2-3 informational interviews is more realistic. Who in your existing network could introduce you to one professional?" |
| **No accountability** | Empty accountability commitment | "Who from today's tutorial could be your check-in partner? Exchange contact info before leaving." |
| **Skills mismatch** | Developing skills unrelated to priority career | "How do these skills specifically connect to your priority career? Let's prioritize the 2-3 most critical gaps." |

## Common Student Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: "My assessment results don't match my self-perception"

**Example:** Student says, "VIA says Creativity is my top strength, but I'm not creative at all."

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "Can you describe how VIA defines Creativity? It includes thinking of novel ways to solve problems, not just artistic creation."
- "Can you think of a time when you approached a problem differently than others did?"
- "Is it possible this is a blind spot—a strength you have but don't recognize?"

**Solutions:**
- Reframe the strength definition using VIA's actual description
- Encourage peer feedback: "What does your partner observe?"
- Suggest hypothesis-testing: "Let's treat this as a question to explore rather than accept or reject immediately"

### Challenge 2: "I don't see any patterns—my results are all different"

**Example:** Student's VIA, Holland Code, and personality results seem unrelated.

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "Let's look at a higher level. Do your results suggest you prefer working with people, ideas, or things?"
- "Do multiple frameworks suggest independent vs. collaborative work, even if the specific strengths differ?"
- "Are you looking for exact word matches? Sometimes themes appear with different vocabulary."

**Solutions:**
- Help student zoom out to meta-categories (people/ideas/things; structured/flexible; analytical/creative)
- Look for process preferences rather than content: "Do you prefer detailed execution or big-picture strategy?"
- Acknowledge that lack of convergence is data: "Diverse results might mean you have versatile strengths—let's explore which contexts bring out different sides."

### Challenge 3: "All my results point toward a career I'm not interested in"

**Example:** All frameworks suggest "Investigative/Analytical" work, but student wants to do sales.

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "What specifically appeals to you about sales?"
- "Could there be sales roles that leverage analytical skills—like technical sales or B2B consultative selling?"
- "Are you reacting against what you perceive as 'boring' analytical work, or have you experienced analytical roles directly?"

**Solutions:**
- Explore hybrid careers that combine patterns: analytical + people = consulting, technical sales, data-driven marketing
- Distinguish between stereotypes and reality: "Let's research what salespeople actually do. Many successful salespeople are highly analytical."
- Validate autonomy: "Assessments generate hypotheses, not mandates. But let's investigate why the mismatch exists—that's valuable information."

### Challenge 4: "I already know what I want to do—why do I need assessments?"

**Example:** Student has decided on a specific career and sees assessments as irrelevant.

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "That's great that you have direction! How do your assessment results support that goal?"
- "Are there aspects of your target career that might not align with your strengths? How would you navigate those?"
- "If your current plan didn't work out, what would be your backup directions based on these patterns?"

**Solutions:**
- Frame assessments as confirmation and refinement, not discovery: "Let's verify that your plan aligns with your natural patterns."
- Identify potential challenges: "Your target is Enterprising work, but your results show Introversion. Let's plan how you'll manage the high social demands."
- Build backup options: "It's wise to have alternative directions that leverage similar strengths."

### Challenge 5: Discomfort with peer feedback (cultural)

**Example:** Vietnamese students may find direct feedback uncomfortable due to cultural norms around harmony and face-saving.

**Diagnostic Signs:**
- Generic positive feedback only ("You're very good!")
- Reluctance to share challenges or weaknesses
- Uncomfortable silence during peer exchange

**Solutions:**
- **Pre-frame feedback culturally:** "In this exercise, we're helping each other discover strengths. Feedback is a gift that helps us grow, not criticism."
- **Model feedback yourself:** Demonstrate specific, observation-based feedback with a volunteer student
- **Provide sentence starters:** Write on board: "I've noticed that you..." / "When we worked together, I observed..." / "Have you considered..."
- **Reframe as 'suggestions' not 'corrections':** "Share observations about patterns you notice" rather than "tell them what's wrong"
- **Allow written feedback option:** Some students may prefer writing observations for their partner to read

### Challenge 6: Unrealistic action plans

**Example:** Student commits to "Interview 10 CEOs, complete 3 internships, learn 5 new software tools—all by next month."

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "Let's prioritize. If you could only complete ONE of these actions, which would give you the most valuable information?"
- "What resources (time, connections, access) do you actually have available this semester?"
- "How will you fit these commitments alongside coursework and other responsibilities?"

**Solutions:**
- **Apply 80/20 rule:** "Which 2-3 actions would give you 80% of the learning?"
- **Start small:** "Let's commit to ONE informational interview this month. After you complete that, you can add more."
- **Check feasibility:** "Do you actually have contact information for these people, or is finding them the first step?"
- **Build incremental plan:** "Month 1: Complete 2 informational interviews. Month 2: Based on those insights, pursue one project or shadowing opportunity."

## Cultural Context Considerations

### Vietnamese Educational Culture

**Background:**
- Vietnamese education traditionally emphasizes teacher authority, correct answers, and structured guidance
- Students may be uncomfortable with open-ended exploration or ambiguity
- Face-saving culture may inhibit sharing weaknesses or uncertainties

**Tutorial Adaptations:**

1. **Structure ambiguity:** While integration requires interpretation, provide clear frameworks (e.g., "Look for these 3 types of patterns: people/ideas/things focus, structure/flexibility preference, independent/collaborative work style")

2. **Normalize uncertainty:** Explicitly state: "It's normal if your results don't give one clear answer. Career exploration is a process, not a one-time decision."

3. **Honor collectivism while building autonomy:** Frame career choices as both personal fulfillment AND contribution to family/society: "Finding work that leverages your strengths allows you to contribute more effectively."

4. **Respect authority concerns:** Some students may seek your definitive answer. Resist: "I see you're looking for the 'right' answer. In career development, you are the expert on yourself. My role is to help you interpret data, not tell you what to do."

### Family Expectations vs. Assessment Results

**Common Scenario:** Student's assessment results suggest Creative/Artistic careers, but family expects traditional professional path (accounting, engineering, medicine).

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Validate both:** "Both your assessment patterns and your family's wisdom matter."
2. **Explore hybrids:** "Are there ways to combine creative strengths with stable careers? Design thinking in engineering, creative marketing in finance?"
3. **Reframe conversation:** "How could you present your strengths to your family using this evidence? 'Research shows my character strengths align with [career], which also offers stability and income.'"
4. **Long-term perspective:** "You might start in a family-approved field and gradually shift toward strength alignment. Many careers are not linear."

**Do not:**
- Dismiss family input as "wrong"
- Frame it as rebellion vs. obedience
- Assume students have full autonomy to choose any career

### Assessment Tool Accessibility

**Potential Issues:**
- Some students may lack reliable internet access at home
- English-language assessments may pose comprehension challenges
- VIA survey is available in Vietnamese; O*NET is English-only

**Solutions:**
- **Provide tutorial time for assessment completion:** If many students arrive unprepared, build in 15 minutes at start
- **Offer Vietnamese alternatives:** VIA Character Strengths has Vietnamese translation
- **English support:** For O*NET (English-only), allow students to work in pairs to interpret questions
- **Alternative assessments:** If O*NET is too difficult, students can use simpler Holland Code assessments available in Vietnamese

## Facilitation Tips

### Creating Psychological Safety

1. **Model vulnerability:** Share your own assessment results briefly: "When I took VIA, I was surprised that [strength] ranked so high, but reflection helped me see it."

2. **Normalize diverse outcomes:** "There's no 'best' personality type or strength profile. Career success comes from alignment, not from having any particular traits."

3. **Emphasize growth:** "Assessment results describe your current patterns, not permanent limitations. Interests and strengths can develop."

4. **Protect confidentiality:** "What's shared in peer feedback stays between partners. This is a safe space for exploration."

### Effective Circulation During Individual Work

**What to listen for:**
- Students expressing confusion: Stop and clarify
- Students making insightful connections: Affirm and ask them to share with class later
- Students rushing through without depth: Slow them down with probing questions

**Intervention Strategies:**

**If student is stuck on convergence:**
- "Let me show you an example. If someone had VIA 'Teamwork,' Holland 'Social,' and MBTI 'Extraversion,' what's the common theme?" [people-orientation]
- "Try grouping your results: Which ones relate to how you work with people? Which relate to types of tasks you enjoy?"

**If student has insightful integration:**
- "This is excellent analysis. Would you be willing to share your approach with the class after individual work?"

**If student is off-task:**
- Proximity: Move nearby and they'll typically refocus
- Direct but kind: "How's your convergence analysis going? Can I help you identify patterns?"

### Managing Time

**If running behind:**
- **Compress Quick Review:** Cut to 2-3 minutes; students have lecture notes for reference
- **Reduce reflection time:** Feedback Reflection can be reduced to 5 minutes
- **Assign Action Planning as homework:** If necessary, have students complete action plans outside tutorial and submit via LMS

**If ahead of schedule:**
- **Deepen Part 2:** Add a second round of peer feedback in groups of 4 (two pairs combine, share summaries)
- **Class sharing:** Invite 2-3 volunteers to share their integrated profiles and career hypotheses with full tutorial
- **Q&A:** Open floor for questions about assessment interpretation or career exploration

### Handling Difficult Dynamics

**Scenario: Student dominates peer feedback, doesn't listen**
- Intervene politely: "I notice [Partner A] has been sharing for a while. Let's make sure [Partner B] gets equal time."
- Set clear expectations: Before Part 2, emphasize: "Each partner gets exactly 5 minutes to share and 5 minutes to receive feedback. I'll keep time."

**Scenario: Student dismisses peer feedback defensively**
- Normalize defensive reactions: "It's natural to feel defensive when feedback surprises us. That might mean it's touching on a blind spot."
- Reframe feedback as perspective: "Your partner is sharing their observations, not absolute truth. What's useful to consider, even if you don't fully agree?"

**Scenario: Pair finishes early and goes off-task**
- Provide extension: "If you've completed feedback exchange, try this: Share one career hypothesis with your partner and brainstorm three specific ways to test that hypothesis."
- Redirect to action planning: "Great that you finished early. You can start Part 3—selecting your priority career hypothesis."

## Assessment Criteria (if graded participation)

If tutorial participation contributes to course grades, evaluate based on:

### Excellent (90-100%)
- **Integration Worksheet:** Identifies clear convergent patterns with specific examples; generates 7+ career hypotheses with explicit framework connections
- **Peer Feedback:** Provides specific, observation-based feedback; asks thoughtful questions; actively listens
- **Action Planning:** Creates specific, feasible plan with clear accountability; identifies realistic skill development steps
- **Engagement:** Fully engaged throughout; helps peers; demonstrates reflective thinking

### Proficient (80-89%)
- **Integration Worksheet:** Identifies some patterns; generates 5-6 career hypotheses with general framework connections
- **Peer Feedback:** Provides feedback with some specificity; asks clarifying questions; attentive listening
- **Action Planning:** Creates mostly specific plan; feasibility is acceptable; includes some accountability
- **Engagement:** Engaged in most activities; adequate participation

### Developing (70-79%)
- **Integration Worksheet:** Lists results but weak pattern identification; generates 3-4 career hypotheses with limited framework support
- **Peer Feedback:** Provides generic feedback; limited questioning; partial attention
- **Action Planning:** Vague or unrealistic plan; limited accountability
- **Engagement:** Partially engaged; some off-task behavior

### Needs Improvement (<70%)
- **Integration Worksheet:** Incomplete or shows minimal effort
- **Peer Feedback:** Minimal or inappropriate feedback; disengaged from partner
- **Action Planning:** Incomplete or unrealistic
- **Engagement:** Frequently off-task or disruptive

**Note:** Focus on effort and engagement over "correct" answers—there are no objectively correct career hypotheses, only well-reasoned or poorly-reasoned ones.

## Connections to Course Assessments

### Personal Development Plan Framework (Week 11)

This tutorial directly feeds the final assessment:

**PDP Components This Tutorial Develops:**
1. **Self-Assessment Section:** Students use today's integration work directly in PDP self-assessment
2. **Career Direction:** Priority career hypothesis becomes PDP career goal
3. **Action Planning:** Experience tests and skill development plan become PDP action items

**Guidance to provide:** "Save your integration worksheet and action plan. You'll incorporate these into your Personal Development Plan Framework due Week 11."

### Weekly Reflection Journal (ongoing)

Tutorial includes structured reflection prompts. Ensure students understand:
- Journal entries are formative (practice) but may contribute to participation grades
- Reflections should be honest, not performative ("what I think tutor wants to hear")
- Length matters less than depth: one paragraph of genuine insight > two pages of surface description

## Frequently Asked Questions

### From Students

**Q: "What if I can't decide on just one priority career for action planning?"**

**A:** That's common! For this exercise, choose the one that (1) excites you most, and (2) you can realistically test this semester through informational interviews or projects. You can explore others later. Career development isn't about choosing once and forever—it's about systematic exploration.

**Q: "Do I have to agree with my assessment results?"**

**A:** No. Assessments are tools, not truth. If results don't resonate, that's valuable information. Ask yourself: Why the disconnect? Is the assessment measuring something I don't value? Is it revealing a blind spot I'm resisting? Or is it simply inaccurate for me? Trust your lived experience, but stay curious about discrepancies.

**Q: "Can I use CliftonStrengths instead of VIA?"**

**A:** If you've already paid for CliftonStrengths, you can certainly use it. However, be aware that recent research (Reid & Short, 2024) shows weaker validity for CliftonStrengths in college students compared to VIA. VIA is free and has stronger evidence, which is why we recommend it.

**Q: "What if my career interests don't match what's realistic in Vietnam's job market?"**

**A:** Important question. Assessment results show what would be ideal fit, not what's necessarily available. Action planning should consider: (1) Are there similar careers in Vietnam that leverage the same strengths? (2) Could you create this role within existing organizations? (3) Would international opportunities or freelancing make this career accessible? (4) What's the backup plan if the ideal isn't currently feasible?

### From Tutors

**Q: How directive should I be in helping students identify career hypotheses?**

**A:** Balance scaffolding with autonomy. Provide frameworks ("Look for people/ideas/things focus") and examples ("If someone scored high Social and Enterprising, they might explore HR management, sales training, or event management"). But resist giving definitive answers ("You should be an accountant"). Ask questions that prompt thinking rather than telling.

**Q: What if a student's career hypotheses seem completely unrealistic given their skills/background?**

**A:** Distinguish between (1) ambitious but developable, and (2) genuinely disconnected from reality.

- **Ambitious:** Student with Artistic interests wants to be UX designer but has no design skills yet → Appropriate response: "Great hypothesis! Let's identify what skills you'd need and how to develop them."

- **Unrealistic:** Student with weak English and no interest in science wants to be medical researcher in US → Appropriate response: "That's a significant aspiration. What specifically appeals to you about medical research? Let's explore whether there are related careers that leverage similar interests but might be more accessible given current constraints."

Frame reality checks as questions, not judgments: "What would need to be true for you to achieve this goal? How likely are those conditions?"

**Q: How do I handle students who complete assessments but then refuse to engage with results?**

**A:** Explore resistance rather than forcing engagement:
- "I notice you seem skeptical of these results. What's not fitting for you?"
- "Assessment tools aren't perfect. What would a more accurate assessment of your strengths look like?"
- "If these frameworks aren't useful, what approach would help you clarify career direction?"

Sometimes resistance indicates that student already has clarity and doesn't need tools—that's fine. Other times it's fear or discomfort with self-examination—gentle probing can help.

**Q: Should I share my own assessment results with students?**

**A:** Brief sharing can be helpful to build rapport and model vulnerability: "When I took VIA, I was surprised [strength] ranked high, but it helped me understand why I enjoy [activity]." Keep it brief (30-60 seconds) and relevant. Avoid making tutorial about you.

---

## Backup Activities (if primary activity fails)

### If assessments aren't completed

**Backup Plan A:** Provide tutorial time for assessment completion
- First 15 minutes: Students complete VIA on phones/laptops
- Remaining time: Compressed integration focusing on VIA + self-reflection (skip Holland Code)

**Backup Plan B:** Retrospective assessment
- Students self-assess without formal tools: "Which of these 24 VIA strengths resonate most?" (provide list)
- Students self-select Holland types: "Which of these 6 descriptions fit you?" (provide RIASEC descriptions)
- Complete integration exercise with self-selected results

### If peer feedback is ineffective

**Backup Plan:** Small group sharing (groups of 4)
- Skip dyadic feedback exchange
- Form groups of 4; each person shares 2-minute summary of integration insights
- Group identifies common themes and unique patterns
- Reduces pressure of one-on-one feedback while maintaining peer perspective

### If students finish early

**Extension Activity 1:** Career Research Sprint
- Students choose one career hypothesis
- Use O*NET to research: tasks, skills, knowledge, abilities required
- Find 2-3 actual job postings for entry-level positions
- Compare job requirements to current skills—identify gaps

**Extension Activity 2:** Values-Strengths Alignment Check
- Students retrieve Week 3 values assessment results
- Map: Do top values align with top strengths and interests?
- Example: If "Creativity" is top value AND VIA strength AND Holland Artistic type, that's strong convergence
- Explore: What if values and assessments conflict?

---

## Post-Tutorial Debrief (for tutor reflection)

After tutorial, consider:

1. **What went well?**
   - Which students had particularly insightful integrations?
   - Were there common patterns in career hypotheses across the group?

2. **What challenged students?**
   - Which part of the activity caused most confusion?
   - Were there cultural dynamics that affected participation?

3. **What would you adjust next time?**
   - Timing allocations
   - Scaffolding for integration
   - Peer feedback structure

4. **Individual student concerns:**
   - Did any students struggle significantly and need follow-up?
   - Are there students whose career hypotheses seem misaligned with their capabilities? (Consider individual conversation)

**Share insights with course coordinator** if there are systemic issues (e.g., many students didn't complete assessments → need clearer pre-tutorial communication).
