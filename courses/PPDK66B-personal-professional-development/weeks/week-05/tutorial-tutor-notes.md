# Week 5 Tutorial: Tutor Guide
## Self-Assessment Integration Workshop

**Course:** PPDK66B Personal & Professional Development
**Tutorial Duration:** 90 minutes
**Difficulty Level:** Moderate-High (requires preparation checking, sensitive facilitation)
**Materials Required:** Assessment results (students bring), templates (provided), timer

---

## Tutorial Overview

**Purpose:**
This tutorial helps students integrate five self-assessment tools (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, Holland Code, EI) into coherent self-understanding that directly informs their Personal Development Plan Part 1 (worth 20% of PDP = 8% of course grade).

**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of this tutorial, students will have:
1. Documented all assessment results with career implications (usable PDP content)
2. Drafted a 200-300 word integration statement identifying patterns
3. Prepared for Mentorship Meeting #2 with thoughtful questions
4. Received peer feedback to strengthen integration quality

**Assessment Connection:**
- **Direct:** Today's work becomes PDP Part 1 content (Self-Knowledge Foundation)
- **Indirect:** Self-assessment insights inform SWOT, vision statement, and SMART goals
- **Mentorship:** Meeting #2 focuses on sharing results and seeking mentor validation

## Pre-Tutorial Preparation

### 1 Week Before

**Communicate Assessment Requirements:**
- Email reminder: "Complete all 5 assessments BEFORE Week 5 tutorial"
- Provide links again:
  - MBTI/16 Personalities: https://www.16personalities.com
  - VIA Character Strengths: https://www.viacharacter.org
  - CliftonStrengths: Distribute access codes (if not already done)
  - Holland Code: https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip
  - EI Assessment: [Course-specific link]
- Estimated time: 90-120 minutes total across all assessments
- Emphasize: "You cannot fully participate without results"

**Set Expectations:**
- Tutorial is APPLIED WORK, not lecture
- Students will share results in small groups (voluntary but encouraged)
- Output is usable PDP Part 1 content—not wasted effort

### 48 Hours Before

**Preparation Check:**
- Survey students: "Who has completed all 5 assessments?"
- If <80% completion, send urgent reminder
- Prepare contingency: First 30 min of tutorial = assessment completion time if needed

**Print Materials:**
- Self-Assessment Summary Template (1 per student)
- Integration Statement Template (1 per student)
- Peer Feedback Protocol (1 per student)
- Mentorship Meeting #2 Prep Form (1 per student)

**Room Setup:**
- Arrange tables for groups of 3-4
- Ensure reliable WiFi (students may need to access digital results)
- Test projector for timer display

### Day Of

**Tech Check:**
- Projector working for timer display
- Backup printed templates available
- WiFi credentials posted visibly

**Mindset:**
- This is a MAKING session—students leave with tangible PDP content
- Balance structure (timed activities) with flexibility (some need more time on certain tasks)
- Sensitivity required—students may feel vulnerable sharing results

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Orient students to today's work
- Check assessment completion
- Set tone: supportive, applied, authentic

**Script:**

"Welcome to Week 5 tutorial. Today is all about integration—taking your five assessment results and making sense of them as a coherent picture of who you are.

**Quick check:** By show of hands, who has completed all five assessments? [Count hands]

[If <80%:]
Okay, if you haven't finished, take the first 30 minutes to complete assessments now. Use laptops, move to sides of room to minimize distraction. The rest of us will start Activity 1.

[If >80%:]
Great. Today you will produce actual content for your PDP Part 1. This isn't practice—this is your Self-Knowledge Foundation section. By the end of tutorial, you'll have:
- Five assessment summaries with career implications
- A 200-300 word integration statement
- Preparation for Mentorship Meeting #2

**Ground rules for today:**
- Sharing assessment results is encouraged but not mandatory in group work
- This is a judgment-free zone—no "right" results, only self-knowledge
- Authenticity over perfection—generic statements help no one
- Keep time boundaries—we have a lot to accomplish

Let's begin."

---

### Activity 1: Individual Documentation (25 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Document all assessment results with career implications (PDP Part 1 content)

**Setup:**
- Distribute Self-Assessment Summary Template
- Students work individually with their assessment results

**Tutor Role: Active Circulation**

**What to Monitor:**

**1. Completion Issues**
- Some students will claim they "completed" assessments but only have vague memories
- **Intervention:** "Pull up your results email/screenshot now. I need to see your specific MBTI type and VIA top 5."
- Have backup laptops for re-accessing results

**2. Generic Descriptions**
- Watch for: "I'm good with people," "I like challenges," "I'm creative"
- **Intervention:** "Can you make that more specific using assessment language? Instead of 'good with people,' try 'My VIA Social Intelligence strength appears when I...'"

**3. Missing Career Implications**
- Students list results but don't connect to career fit
- **Intervention:** "So your Holland Code is ASE—what careers match that? Look at the O*NET list if you need ideas."

**4. Over-Identification**
- Some students will treat results as absolute truth
- **Intervention:** "Remember the lecture—MBTI has weak validity. Use it for reflection, not limitation. What does INTJ suggest about work environment preferences?"

**5. Critical Thinking on Validity**
- Check that students noted MBTI and CliftonStrengths validity concerns
- **Intervention:** "Add a note here: 'I recognize CliftonStrengths has weak reliability in students (Reid & Short, 2024), so I'm weighting VIA more heavily.'"

**Common Questions & Responses:**

**Q:** "I got different MBTI results on different tests. Which do I use?"
**A:** "That's actually evidence of the reliability problem we discussed in lecture. Pick the type that FEELS most accurate based on your self-knowledge, and note the inconsistency in your integration statement."

**Q:** "My CliftonStrengths top 5 don't match my VIA top 5. Is that wrong?"
**A:** "No—they measure different things. CliftonStrengths = talents (how you work). VIA = character (who you are). Look for RELATED patterns, not identical matches."

**Q:** "Do I need to write about ALL 24 VIA strengths?"
**A:** "No—just your top 5 signature strengths. Those are the ones that energize you and feel authentic."

**Q:** "What if my Holland Code doesn't match my major?"
**A:** "That's worth noting! Either (1) you chose the wrong major, or (2) you're planning to apply your major in a different field. Example: Finance major (C-type) working in creative industries (A-type) doing financial analysis for ad agencies."

**Time Warnings:**
- At 15 min: "Halfway point—you should have 3 assessments documented."
- At 20 min: "5 minutes left—finish up and focus on integration notes."
- At 25 min: "Pens down. You can polish this later—for now we're moving to group work."

**Tutor Check-In (End of Activity 1):**
- Quick scan: Are templates mostly filled in?
- If many students struggling, extend 5 minutes
- If most done, proceed to Activity 2

---

### Activity 2: Small Group Integration Practice (30 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Draft 200-300 word integration statement identifying patterns

**Setup:**
- Assign groups of 3-4 (pre-planned if possible, or count off)
- Display timer prominently
- Distribute Integration Statement Template

**Group Formation Strategy:**

**Goal:** Mix personality types for diverse perspectives

**Method:**
- If you know students: pair high self-disclosers with quieter students
- If you don't: "Find 2-3 people you DON'T usually work with"
- Avoid: All introverts in one group (too quiet), all extraverts in another (too loud)

**Facilitation Script:**

"You're now in integration groups. Each person gets 7-8 minutes of focused attention. Your job as listeners is to help identify patterns your groupmate might not see.

**Process:**
1. Person A shares results (3 min)
2. Group identifies patterns (2 min)
3. Group generates career hypotheses (2 min)
4. Rotate to Person B

After everyone shares, you'll have 10 minutes to draft your individual integration statement.

**Timer starts now for Person A in each group.**"

**Tutor Role: Strategic Listening**

**Circulate Between Groups:**

Listen for 1-2 minutes per group to assess quality, then intervene if needed.

**Red Flags & Interventions:**

**1. Surface-Level Sharing**
- Student: "I'm ENFP, my Holland Code is S, I like helping people."
- **Intervention:** "Dig deeper. HOW does your ENFP preference show up? Give a specific example of when Social Holland type appeared in your life."

**2. Group Silent/Not Participating**
- Group members stare at phones while one person talks
- **Intervention:** "Pause. Listeners, what patterns have you heard so far? Tell [student name] what you notice."

**3. Forced Coherence**
- Student: "Everything says I'm extraverted."
- But you know they're quiet in class
- **Intervention:** "What about contradictions? MBTI might say extravert, but what does your Holland Code or CliftonStrengths say? Explore that."

**4. No Career Application**
- Group discusses types academically without connecting to work
- **Intervention:** "Great analysis. Now—what jobs or environments match this profile? Be specific."

**5. Overly Critical Self-Talk**
- Student: "I scored low on [trait], so I can't do [career]."
- **Intervention:** "Hold on. Low [trait] doesn't disqualify you. It means you'd approach [career] differently. How might your strengths compensate?"

**Strong Group Indicators:**
- Active listening (eye contact, note-taking)
- Thoughtful questions ("Why do you think your MBTI Introversion doesn't match your Social Holland type?")
- Specific pattern identification ("I notice creativity shows up in 3 of your 5 assessments...")
- Career brainstorming ("Have you considered UX research? It matches your I, A, and Curiosity VIA strength")

**Time Management:**

- **0-8 min:** Person A shares + group feedback
- **8-16 min:** Person B shares + group feedback
- **16-24 min:** Person C shares + group feedback
- **24-30 min:** (Person D if 4-person group, otherwise early finish)
- **30-40 min:** Individual drafting time (everyone writes simultaneously)

**At 30-Minute Mark:**

"Time for sharing is up. Now everyone writes your own integration statement individually. You have 10 minutes. Use the template structure: Patterns paragraph, Contradictions paragraph, Career Implications paragraph. Go."

**During Drafting (30-40 min):**

- Enforce silence—this is individual work
- Circulate to read over shoulders (with permission)
- Provide real-time feedback via marginal notes or whispered comments

**Drafting Quality Checks:**

**Strong Statement Indicators:**
- ✓ Uses specific assessment language ("VIA Perspective," "Holland I-type," "MBTI T preference")
- ✓ Provides evidence (examples from life, not just test results)
- ✓ Addresses contradiction thoughtfully
- ✓ Names specific career types/environments
- ✓ Sounds like THIS person, not anyone

**Weak Statement Indicators:**
- ✗ Just lists results ("I'm ENTP with strengths in X, Y, Z")
- ✗ Generic ("I'm good with people and like solving problems")
- ✗ No contradictions addressed (forced coherence)
- ✗ Vague career implications ("I'd be good at business")
- ✗ Could apply to multiple people (not authentic)

**Time Warning:**
- At 38 min: "2 minutes—finish your current sentence and move to conclusion."
- At 40 min: "Pens down. You'll revise during peer feedback."

---

### Activity 3: Mentorship Meeting #2 Preparation (20 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Prepare structured questions and objectives for upcoming mentor meeting

**Setup:**
- Distribute Mentorship Meeting #2 Preparation Form
- Students work individually

**Facilitation Script:**

"Your Mentorship Meeting #2 should happen this week or next. The focus is sharing your assessment results and getting your mentor's perspective. Remember the Johari Window—mentors help reduce your Blind Spot.

You have 20 minutes to complete the preparation form. This is the ACTUAL form you'll submit 48 hours before your meeting, so make it count.

**Key requirements:**
- 5-7 thoughtful questions (not yes/no questions)
- 1-page assessment summary for your mentor
- Clear meeting objectives

Begin."

**Tutor Role: Question Quality Control**

**Circulate and review questions. Intervene on:**

**1. Closed Questions**
- Weak: "Do you think I should do consulting?"
- **Coaching:** "Rephrase as open-ended. Try: 'Based on my profile, what aspects suggest consulting fit, and what concerns would you have?'"

**2. Too Many Questions**
- Student has 12 questions listed
- **Coaching:** "Pick your top 5-7. Better to explore fewer questions deeply than rush through many."

**3. No Vulnerability**
- All questions are surface-level, no contradictions shared
- **Coaching:** "Mentors are most helpful when you share what you're uncertain about. Add a question about your confusion between [X and Y results]."

**4. Overly Personal/Inappropriate**
- Rare, but occasionally students ask about mentor's personal life inappropriately
- **Coaching:** "Keep questions focused on professional development and career guidance."

**5. Missing Assessment Summary**
- Students skip the "1-page summary for mentor" section
- **Coaching:** "Your mentor needs context. Summarize your results in 5-7 bullet points so you can spend meeting time discussing, not explaining."

**Strong Question Examples to Share:**

Post these on board/screen as models:

- "Based on your experience with me so far, do my assessment results seem accurate? What surprises you?"
- "How have you seen people with [similar profile] succeed or struggle in [industry]?"
- "Given my Holland Code is [X], what career paths in [field] would you recommend I explore?"
- "If [assessment weakness] is a gap for me, what's the most effective way to develop it in the next year?"
- "I'm torn between [option A] and [option B]. Based on my profile, which aligns better with who I am?"

**Time Warnings:**
- At 10 min: "Halfway—objectives and summary done, now focus on questions."
- At 15 min: "5 minutes—finalize your top 5-7 questions."
- At 20 min: "This form is due 48 hours before your meeting. If your meeting is this week, submit tonight."

---

### Activity 4: Peer Feedback & Revision (15 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Improve integration statement based on structured peer feedback

**Setup:**
- Partner students (ideally with someone NOT in their integration group)
- Distribute Peer Feedback Protocol

**Facilitation Script:**

"Find a partner—someone you didn't work with in Activity 2 if possible. You'll exchange integration statements and provide feedback using the protocol.

**Process:**
1. Exchange statements (1 min)
2. Partner A reads and provides feedback (5 min)
3. Partner B reads and provides feedback (5 min)
4. Both revise based on feedback (5 min)

Be honest but kind. Focus on making their statement STRONGER, not criticizing.

Begin exchanging."

**Tutor Role: Feedback Quality Monitor**

**Circulate to check feedback quality:**

**Weak Feedback:**
- "This is good." (not helpful)
- "I don't see any problems." (probably not reading carefully)
- Correcting grammar/spelling only (missing content issues)

**Strong Feedback:**
- "Your pattern identification is strong, but I don't see career implications. Add a sentence about where you'd thrive."
- "The contradiction between I and S is interesting—can you explain WHY that makes sense rather than just noting it?"
- "You use MBTI language correctly, but I don't see VIA strengths mentioned. Where do they fit?"

**Intervention Examples:**

If you see weak feedback happening:

**Tutor:** "What's one specific way this statement could be stronger?"
**Student:** "Um... it's pretty good..."
**Tutor:** "Look at the rubric. Are the career implications specific or vague?"
**Student:** "Oh, kind of vague—it just says 'business.'"
**Tutor:** "Great catch. Write that as feedback."

**Time Management:**
- 0-1 min: Exchange
- 1-6 min: Partner A gives feedback
- 6-11 min: Partner B gives feedback
- 11-15 min: Both revise

**At 11-Minute Mark:**

"Stop giving feedback. Now revise your OWN statement based on what you received. You have 4 minutes."

**Revision Monitoring:**

- Students should be actively editing, not passively re-reading
- If a student says "I don't need to change anything," challenge: "What was the one suggestion for improvement? Try incorporating that."

### Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Summarize accomplishments
- Clarify next steps
- Connect today's work to PDP and mentorship

**Facilitation Script:**

"Excellent work today. Let's recap what you accomplished:

**You now have:**
1. ✓ All five assessment results documented with career implications
2. ✓ A draft integration statement (200-300 words)
3. ✓ Preparation for Mentorship Meeting #2
4. ✓ Peer feedback to strengthen your work

**This is not hypothetical—this IS your PDP Part 1 content.** You'll polish it, but the heavy lifting is done.

**Immediate next steps:**

[Display on screen]

**Before Next Week (Field Trip):**
- Complete any unfinished assessments
- Revise integration statement based on peer feedback
- Schedule Mentorship Meeting #2 if not already scheduled
- Submit Meeting #2 Prep Form 48 hours before meeting

**Within 1 Week:**
- Conduct Mentorship Meeting #2
- Submit Post-Meeting Reflection within 48 hours after meeting
- Transfer today's work into your PDP Part 1 template (available on course site)

**Before Week 11 (PDP Due):**
- Incorporate mentor feedback from Meeting #2
- Polish all Part 1 sections
- Use self-knowledge to inform SWOT, vision, and goals

**Questions?**

[Answer any questions]

Next week is the MISA field trip. Use your self-knowledge to observe: 'Would I thrive in this environment? Why or why not?' That's applied integration.

See you at MISA."

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: <80% Assessment Completion

**Symptoms:**
- Many students haven't completed assessments before tutorial
- Claims of "I forgot" or "I didn't have time"

**Response:**
- Allocate first 30 minutes for on-the-spot completion
- Those who completed work on Activity 1 in corner of room
- Set strict expectation: "This is now class time. Next week, this won't be an option."

**Prevention for Future:**
- Earlier and more frequent reminders
- Canvas assignment with completion checkbox
- Brief survey 3 days before: "Which assessments have you completed?"

---

### Issue: Student Refuses to Share in Group

**Symptoms:**
- "I don't want to share my results."
- Sits silently during group work

**Response:**
- Respect boundary—never force self-disclosure
- Offer alternative: "You can participate as a listener for others, then draft your integration independently."
- Private check-in: "Is there something about the assessments that concerns you?" (May reveal validity skepticism, personal discomfort, etc.)

**Follow-Up:**
- Ensure they still complete individual deliverables (summary, integration statement)
- Note: PDP requires documenting results, but not public sharing

---

### Issue: Student Disputes Assessment Validity

**Symptoms:**
- "These tests are pseudoscience."
- Refuses to engage seriously with results

**Response:**
- Acknowledge their critical thinking: "You're right to question—we discussed MBTI's weak validity in lecture."
- Redirect to learning objective: "The goal isn't blind acceptance—it's learning to use tools wisely. What CAN you learn from patterns, even if individual tests are flawed?"
- Offer alternative frame: "Treat assessments as HYPOTHESES about yourself to test through experience."

**If Persistent:**
- "Complete the exercise documenting what the assessments SAY, plus your critical evaluation. That shows deeper thinking than just accepting results."

---

### Issue: Dominant Group Member

**Symptoms:**
- One student talks entire time, others can't share
- Group running out of time before everyone presents

**Response:**
- Interrupt politely: "Let's pause here. We need to ensure everyone gets their 7-8 minutes. Person B, you're up next."
- Privately coach dominant student: "You have great insights. Now practice active listening—help others by identifying THEIR patterns."

**Prevention:**
- Set visible timer for each person
- Assign roles: "Person C, you're timekeeper. Keep us on track."

---

### Issue: Group Goes Off-Topic

**Symptoms:**
- Discussing last night's party, upcoming assignment, unrelated topics
- Not focused on assessments

**Response:**
- Proximity: Move closer to group (often self-corrects)
- Direct: "What patterns are you identifying for [student name]'s assessments?"
- Reset: "You have 15 minutes left total. Person C hasn't shared yet. Refocus."

---

### Issue: Student Emotional Reaction to Results

**Symptoms:**
- Tears, distress, visible discomfort
- "I don't like what this says about me."

**Response:**
- Private conversation: Step aside from group
- Normalize: "Assessment results can be confronting. What specifically is bothering you?"
- Reframe: "These tools show preferences and patterns, not worth or capability. You're not limited by any type."
- If serious distress: "Would you like to connect with counseling services? I can help arrange that."

**Note:**
- Rare but possible—have counseling referral info ready
- Follow up after class to check in

---

### Issue: Time Running Over

**Symptoms:**
- Activity 2 takes 40 minutes instead of 30
- Won't finish all activities

**Response:**
- **Prioritize:** Activities 1, 2, 4 are essential (PDP content). Activity 3 can be homework.
- **Compress:** Cut wrap-up to 2 minutes, send detailed next-steps email instead.
- **Extend (if possible):** Ask students if they can stay 10 extra minutes.

**Prevention:**
- Strict timekeeping from start
- Use visible countdown timer, audible alarm
- Warn students: "We have a lot to accomplish—stay focused."

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

### Immediately After (Same Day)

**Check Submissions:**
- How many students submitted work via course platform (if required)?
- Note who didn't complete assessments—follow up individually

**Email Reminder:**

Subject: Week 5 Tutorial Follow-Up: Next Steps

Body:
"Great work in today's tutorial. Reminder of next steps:

1. Revise your integration statement based on peer feedback
2. Schedule Mentorship Meeting #2 (aim for this week or next)
3. Submit Meeting #2 Prep Form 48 hours BEFORE your meeting
4. Transfer today's content into PDP Part 1 template (link: [___])

Field trip to MISA is [date]. See you there.

Questions? Office hours [times]."

---

### Within 3 Days

**Individual Follow-Ups:**

Reach out to:
- Students who didn't complete assessments
- Students who seemed distressed
- Students who didn't participate in group work

**Template:**

"Hi [Name], I noticed you [didn't have assessment results / seemed uncomfortable] in tutorial. Just checking in—how can I support you in completing this work? It's important for your PDP. Let me know if you'd like to meet."

---

### Before Next Tutorial

**Review Mentorship Prep Forms:**
- As students submit Meeting #2 prep forms, quickly review
- Flag weak questions and email coaching: "Consider rephrasing Q3 as open-ended..."

**Prepare for Field Trip:**
- Remind students to bring assessment insights
- Prompt: "As you observe MISA, ask yourself: Would my Holland Code thrive here?"

---

## Assessment & Grading Notes

**What to Assess (if grading tutorial participation):**

This tutorial doesn't have a standalone grade, but contributes to:

**1. Mentorship Program (20%):**
- Meeting #2 Prep Form quality
- Evidence of self-assessment integration in post-meeting reflection

**2. Personal Development Plan (40%):**
- Part 1: Self-Assessment Summary (directly from Activity 1)
- Part 1: Integration Statement (directly from Activity 2)
- Part 4: Mentor Integration (Meeting #2 discusses assessments)

**Formative Feedback Opportunities:**

While circulating, provide:
- Verbal feedback on summary quality
- Marginal notes on integration statements
- Question rephrasing for mentor prep

**Red Flags for PDP Grading:**

Note students who:
- Can't articulate patterns (will struggle with integration statement)
- Have generic career implications (will have weak Part 1)
- Didn't prepare thoughtful mentor questions (will have poor Meeting #2 evidence)

Flag these students for early intervention before PDP deadline.

---

## Common Tutor Questions

**Q: What if a student's assessment results genuinely don't make sense together?**

**A:** This is actually valuable insight. Coach them to write: "The contradiction between [X] and [Y] suggests I'm context-dependent—I show [X traits] in [situations] but [Y traits] in [other situations]." Nuance is sophisticated.

---

**Q: Should I share my own assessment results to model integration?**

**A:** Optional, but can be powerful if done briefly (2-3 min max). Share your integration, including contradictions. Shows vulnerability and critical thinking. But don't dominate—this is about students.

---

**Q: What if a student asks me to interpret their assessment results?**

**A:** Redirect to self-interpretation: "What do YOU think it means?" or "How does that result show up in your life?" You're not a career counselor—your job is teaching integration skills, not providing answers.

---

**Q: How do I handle students who treat MBTI as gospel despite validity concerns?**

**A:** Acknowledge appeal: "MBTI language is helpful for self-reflection." Then reinforce: "But research shows it's not predictive for careers. Use it as ONE input alongside VIA and Holland Code, which have stronger evidence." Redirect to integration—patterns across tools matter more than any single type.

---

**Q: What if integration groups finish early?**

**A:** Extend depth: "Now discuss how each person's profile would show up in group projects. Who's the strategic thinker? The relationship builder? How can you leverage differences?" Or: "Practice your Mentorship Meeting #2 pitch—explain your results as you would to your mentor."

---

## Success Indicators

**You'll know the tutorial succeeded if:**

✓ 80%+ students have complete assessment summaries by end of Activity 1
✓ Integration statements show patterns (not just lists of results)
✓ Students can articulate career hypotheses based on self-knowledge
✓ Mentorship prep questions are open-ended and thoughtful
✓ Peer feedback is specific and constructive
✓ Students express "This was useful for my PDP" (not "That was busy work")

**Red flags:**

✗ Many students still don't have assessment results by end of tutorial
✗ Integration statements are generic and could apply to anyone
✗ No contradictions addressed (forced coherence)
✗ Career implications are vague ("I'm good at business")
✗ Mentor questions are closed ("Should I do X?")
✗ Students say "I don't see the point of this"

---

## Tutor Reflection Questions (Post-Tutorial)

**Self-Assessment:**

1. Did I maintain time boundaries effectively? (Yes/No)

2. What percentage of students produced usable PDP Part 1 content? (Estimate)

3. Which activity took longer than planned? Why?

4. Did I successfully intervene on weak integration statements during circulation?

5. What will I do differently next time?

**Notes for Course Coordinator:**

- Assessment completion rate:
- Common student misconceptions:
- Suggested improvements to templates:
- Time allocation adjustments needed:

---

**End of Tutor Guide. You're prepared to facilitate a high-impact, applied tutorial that produces tangible PDP content while building students' self-knowledge and career clarity.**
