**Link:** https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action

**Reflection prompt:** "What is YOUR 'why'? Why do you want the career you're pursuing?"

### What Is Entrepreneurial Mindset?

Entrepreneurial mindset is a set of attitudes, skills, and behaviors that enable individuals to identify opportunities, overcome challenges, and create value - whether in a startup, corporate environment, or personal career development.

**Critical Distinction:** You don't need to start a business to think entrepreneurially. This mindset is valuable for ALL career paths.

### Core Components

**1. Opportunity Recognition**
- Seeing possibilities where others see problems
- Identifying unmet needs and potential solutions
- Connecting disparate ideas in novel ways
- Asking "What if...?" and "Why not?"

**2. Calculated Risk-Taking**
- Distinguishing between reckless and strategic risk
- Analyzing potential outcomes before acting
- Comfort with uncertainty and ambiguity
- Balancing boldness with prudence

**3. Innovation & Creative Problem-Solving**
- Challenging conventional approaches
- Experimenting with new methods
- Iterating based on feedback
- Finding resourceful solutions with limited resources

**4. Resilience & Persistence**
- Learning from failure rather than being defeated by it
- Maintaining motivation through setbacks
- Adapting strategies while maintaining vision
- Bouncing back stronger from challenges

**5. Proactive Initiative**
- Taking action without being told
- Self-starting and self-directing
- Creating opportunities rather than waiting for them
- Demonstrating agency and ownership

**6. Growth Orientation**
- Continuous learning and skill development
- Seeking feedback and improvement
- Embracing challenges as growth opportunities
- Viewing abilities as developable (not fixed)

- Opportunity recognition requires learning from criticism and feedback

**During the session:** Listen for evidence of growth mindset in Ms. Ha Linh's career story.
