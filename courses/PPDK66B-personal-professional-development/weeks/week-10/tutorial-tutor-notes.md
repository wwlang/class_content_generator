- Note students who seem disengaged (check in afterward)
- Gently redirect distractions (phone use, side conversations) with proximity or eye contact
- Sit where you can see both speaker and students

**Time Management:**
- Track time discreetly
- If running significantly over (10+ minutes), consider:

---

### Q&A Session (30 minutes)

**Facilitating Student Participation:**

**Opening Q&A:**

"Thank you, Ms. Ha Linh, for that insightful presentation. We now have 30 minutes for questions. I know many of you prepared questions - please raise your hand and I'll call on you. When asking, please stand, introduce yourself briefly, and ask your question clearly."

**Encouraging Participation:**
- **If no hands immediately:** Wait 10-15 seconds (silence encourages someone to break it)
- **If still no volunteers:** "I'll start with a question, then open the floor..." (ask your prepared question)
- **If same students dominating:** "Let's hear from someone who hasn't asked yet..."
- **If questions dry up early:** "I have a few more questions if students do..."

**Managing Q&A:**
- Call on diverse students (gender, seating location, participation level)
- If question is unclear, help rephrase: "I think what [student] is asking is..."
- If question is inappropriate, redirect: "That's a great question for a different context. Let's focus on..."
- Watch time - aim for 4-6 questions (5-7 minutes each including answer)
- Save 5 minutes at end for closing

**Types of Questions to Encourage:**
- Career preparation and development strategies
- Decision-making approaches and frameworks
- Skills emphasis and continuous learning
- Work-life balance and energy management
- Entrepreneurial mindset in practice
- Advice for students entering workforce

**Questions to Redirect (privately coach student later):**
- Salary/compensation specifics (inappropriate)
- Overly personal questions
- Yes/no questions with no depth
- Questions clearly answered in presentation (shows inattention)

**Your Questions (Optional - if needed):**

If student questions are sparse or shallow, you might ask:

- "Could you elaborate on how you approach calculated risk-taking? How do you distinguish strategic from reckless risks?"
- "You mentioned [specific failure/setback]. What specific practices helped you maintain resilience during that period?"
- "What advice would you give educators like us about how to better prepare students for careers in the digital economy?"
- "How has your approach to continuous learning evolved throughout your career?"
- "What role has emotional intelligence played in your professional success?"

These model depth and can spark follow-up questions from students.

## Week 11 Tutorial: Post-Session Debrief & Integration

**Week 11 tutorial focuses on:**
1. Debriefing guest speaker session
2. Connecting MISA + guest speaker for reflective essay
3. PDP finalization with guest speaker insights
4. Reflective essay planning

### Tutorial Structure (90 minutes)

---

### Segment 1: Guest Speaker Debrief (20 minutes)

**Opening (5 minutes):**

"Welcome to Week 11. Last week Ms. Ha Linh shared her career journey and insights. Today we're going to debrief that experience, connect it to the MISA field trip, and use both to inform your reflective essays and development plans.

First, let's share immediate reactions. What's ONE word that captures your biggest takeaway from Ms. Ha Linh's session?"

**Whip-around:** Each student shares one word (Inspiration, Resilience, Adaptability, Risk-taking, Innovation, etc.)

**Group Discussion (15 minutes):**

Facilitate discussion around these questions:

1. **"What specific examples of entrepreneurial mindset did you observe in Ms. Ha Linh's career journey?"**
   - Listen for: opportunity recognition, calculated risk-taking, resilience, innovation, proactive initiative, growth orientation
   - Connect to Week 9 growth mindset content
   - Ask: "How did she demonstrate growth mindset specifically?"

2. **"What surprised you or challenged your assumptions about career development?"**
   - Listen for: non-linear paths, importance of resilience, value of networks, role of luck + preparation
   - Ask follow-up: "How does this change how you're thinking about your own career?"

3. **"What advice did she offer that you found most actionable?"**
   - Listen for: specific skills to develop, strategies to implement, mindsets to adopt
   - Ask: "Who's planning to implement something specific she recommended?"

**Bridge to Next Segment:**

"Excellent insights. Now let's think about how the guest speaker connects to the MISA field trip you experienced in Week 6..."

---

### Segment 2: Integrating MISA + Guest Speaker (20 minutes)

**Connecting Two Experiences (Individual Reflection - 5 minutes):**

"In your notebook, take 5 minutes to answer:

1. What themes connect the MISA field trip and Ms. Ha Linh's presentation?
2. How do these two experiences complement each other?
3. What did you learn from both together that you wouldn't have learned from just one?"

**Small Group Sharing (10 minutes):**

Groups of 3-4 students share their reflections.

**Prompt:** "Discuss the connections you identified. Look for patterns across your group's observations."

**Whole Group Synthesis (5 minutes):**

Each group shares one key connection:
- "Both emphasized the importance of..."
- "MISA showed us X in practice, while Ms. Ha Linh explained Y principle..."
- "Together they revealed that..."

**Capture themes on board:**
- Common themes might include: continuous learning, adaptability, emotional intelligence, innovation, networking, digital skills, entrepreneurial thinking, resilience, etc.

**Bridge:**

"These themes will form the backbone of your reflective essay. You're not writing two separate reflections - you're synthesizing insights from both experiences to answer: 'What do these activities inform you about your preparation for your future career?'"

---

### Segment 3: Reflective Essay Planning (25 minutes)

**Essay Requirements Review (5 minutes):**

Recap the Individual Assignment requirements:

**Reflective Essay (10% of final grade)**

**Framework Selection (10 minutes):**

"Let's review the three reflective frameworks you can choose from:"

**Quick review (visual on board):**

| **Gibbs** | Description → Feelings → Evaluation → Analysis → Conclusion → Action | Detailed, systematic thinkers |
| **Kolb** | Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation | Experiential learners |

**Individual Decision:**
"In your notebook, write which framework you'll use and WHY it fits your thinking style."

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Low Attendance at Guest Speaker Session

**Prevention:**
- Emphasize mandatory attendance multiple times
- Explain cannot be made up and is required for reflective essay
- Schedule at reasonable time
- Build excitement with speaker bio

**If it happens:**
- Document reason for each absence
- If legitimate (illness, family emergency), explore alternatives:
  - Recording if available (poor substitute but better than nothing)
  - Detailed notes from classmate + additional readings
  - Modified essay assignment (consult instructor)
- If unexcused, student cannot fully complete reflective essay (significant grade impact)

---

### Challenge 2: Students Don't Ask Questions During Q&A

**Prevention:**
- Require question preparation in advance
- Explain importance of networking and professional engagement
- Model question-asking yourself

**If it happens:**
- Wait longer (15-20 seconds of silence)
- Ask first question yourself to break ice
- Call on specific students: "[Name], I know you had questions prepared - would you share one?"
- Have backup questions ready (5-6 thoughtful ones)
- Make it smaller: "Raise your hand if you've wondered about [topic speaker mentioned]?"

**Post-session:**
- Address in tutorial: "Why was Q&A participation challenging?"
- Coach for future professional settings

---

### Challenge 3: Students Ask Inappropriate or Poor Quality Questions

**Examples:**
- "How much money do you make?"
- Questions already answered in presentation
- Overly personal questions
- No actual question, just a statement

**In-the-moment response:**
- Redirect gracefully: "That's a question for a different context. Let's focus on career development strategies..."
- Help rephrase: "I think what you're asking is... Is that right?"
- If necessary, apologize to speaker and move to next question

**Post-session:**
- Private conversation with student about professional norms
- Use as teaching moment in tutorial (without calling out individual)

---

### Challenge 4: Speaker Runs Significantly Over Time

**Prevention:**
- Confirm timing in advance (60 min presentation + 30 min Q&A)
- Provide speaker with time reminders ("10 minutes remaining")
- Build buffer into schedule

**If it happens:**
- Signal discreetly during natural pause ("We have 10 minutes for Q&A")
- If drastically over (eating into Q&A completely), politely interrupt: "Ms. Ha Linh, this is fascinating. To ensure students can ask questions, could we transition to Q&A?"
- Adjust Q&A time if needed (fewer, shorter questions)
- Extend session slightly if possible and speaker willing

**Post-session:**
- Still valuable if Q&A is shortened - content matters most
- Students can email speaker additional questions if contact info shared

---

### Challenge 5: Students Don't Complete Reflection Template

**Prevention:**
- Explain importance for assessment (reflective essay, PDP)
- Set clear deadline (48 hours)
- Make it required for tutorial participation
- Check completion in tutorial (bring template)

**If deadline missed:**
- Individual follow-up: "I haven't received your template. What's preventing completion?"
- Reminder of assessment impact (can't write strong essay without it)
- Extended deadline with late penalty if appropriate
- Require completion before PDP submission (Week 11)

---

### Challenge 6: Technology Failure During Session

**Prevention:**
- Test everything in advance (multiple times)
- Have speaker's slides backed up (USB, email, cloud)
- Know how to troubleshoot quickly

**If it happens:**
- Stay calm (speaker and students mirror your stress)
- Have backup plan: "Ms. Ha Linh, please continue without slides while we troubleshoot"
- Assign student or co-tutor to fix while session continues
- If unfixable, speaker proceeds without visuals (content matters most)

---

### Reflective Frameworks (Quick Reference for Tutorial)

**From Week 3:**

**Gibbs' Reflective Cycle:**
1. Description (What happened?)
2. Feelings (What were you thinking/feeling?)
3. Evaluation (What was good/bad about experience?)
4. Analysis (What sense can you make of it?)
5. Conclusion (What else could you have done?)
6. Action Plan (What will you do next time?)

**Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle:**
1. Concrete Experience (Doing/having experience)
2. Reflective Observation (Reviewing/reflecting on experience)
3. Abstract Conceptualization (Concluding/learning from experience)
4. Active Experimentation (Planning/trying out what learned)

**Driscoll & Bolton Model:**
1. What? (Description of event)
2. So What? (Analysis of event)
3. Now What? (Proposed actions)

Help students choose based on thinking style and essay needs.

## Success Indicators for Guest Speaker Session

**You'll know the session was successful if:**

1. **High attendance** (90%+ of class present)
2. **Professional conduct** (dressed appropriately, engaged, respectful, asking questions)
3. **Active participation** (at least 50% of students asked questions or contributed to Q&A)
4. **Detailed reflections** (completed templates show specific insights, not vague observations)
5. **Enthusiasm** (students express value and excitement about insights gained)
6. **Integration** (students reference speaker in PDPs, essays, and oral exams)
7. **Behavior change** (students implement specific advice received)
8. **Speaker satisfaction** (Ms. Ha Linh reports positive experience, students were engaged)
9. **Assessment quality** (reflective essays show synthesis of MISA + speaker)
10. **Mentorship discussion** (Meeting 4 reflections mention speaker insights)

**Red flags requiring follow-up:**
- Multiple students absent without legitimate reason
- Few or no questions during Q&A
- Generic, surface-level reflections (suggests disengagement)
- Students unable to articulate what they learned
- No mention of speaker in PDPs or essays (suggests disconnect)
- Speaker reports concerns about student professionalism or engagement

## Final Reminders for Tutors

### Before the Session:
- Confirm all logistics obsessively (technology, room, speaker, materials)
- Set clear professional expectations with students (attendance, dress, conduct)
- Prepare students to engage meaningfully (questions, preparation, mindset)

### During the Session:
- Model the professionalism and engagement you expect from students
- Facilitate smoothly without taking over (speaker's time, students' learning)
- Monitor engagement and be ready to support participation

### After the Session:
- Ensure learning is captured (reflection templates completed)
- Facilitate deep debrief in tutorial (connect experiences, plan essays, integrate into PDPs)
- Follow up with speaker (gratitude) and students (completion and integration)

### Overall:
The guest speaker session, combined with the MISA field trip, provides students with **authentic, real-world learning** that readings alone cannot offer. These experiential components are potentially the most memorable and impactful experiences of the semester.

Your job is to:
- Make the session professional and smooth
- Ensure students engage actively and respectfully
- Facilitate deep reflection and integration
- Connect insights to assessments (essay, PDP, oral exam)

**This is where theory meets practice. Make it transformative.**
