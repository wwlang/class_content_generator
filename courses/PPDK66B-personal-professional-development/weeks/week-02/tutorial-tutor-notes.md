# Week 2 Tutorial: Tutor Facilitation Guide

**Course:** PPDK66B Personal & Professional Development
**Tutorial Topic:** AI-Powered Career Skills Workshop
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Difficulty Level:** Moderate (students will need technical troubleshooting support)

---

## Tutorial Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to:
1. Apply context engineering principles to create professional materials
2. Distinguish workslop from high-quality AI-assisted content
3. Use the Explore-Build-Connect-Refine framework for career development
4. Demonstrate pilot mindset when working with AI tools
5. Evaluate their own outputs using the 30-Second Test

**Key Challenge:**
This is students' first hands-on practice with AI tools in an academic setting. Many will have used ChatGPT casually but not strategically. Your role is to:
- Normalize AI use as a professional tool (not cheating)
- Build judgment about WHEN and HOW to use AI effectively
- Prevent workslop production while encouraging experimentation

**Success Indicators:**
- Students can articulate the difference between pilot and passenger mindsets
- Students produce at least one AI-assisted artifact that passes the 30-Second Test
- Students identify which Explore-Build-Connect-Refine stage is their personal gap
- Class discussion shows critical thinking about AI limitations, not blind acceptance

---

## Pre-Tutorial Preparation

**Technical Setup (30 minutes before class):**
- [ ] Test classroom WiFi and ensure it can handle 30+ students accessing AI tools simultaneously
- [ ] Project sample AI interactions on screen for demonstration
- [ ] Prepare backup: printed copies of workslop detection excerpts (Activity 2) in case of tech failure
- [ ] Have sample job posting ready to share with students who forgot to bring one
- [ ] Test at least two AI tools yourself (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to troubleshoot student issues

**Materials Needed:**
- [ ] Whiteboard/projector for documenting class insights
- [ ] Timer for keeping activities on schedule
- [ ] Sample student CV or experiences to demonstrate Activity 1 (anonymized or fictional)
- [ ] Printed handout with Activity 2 cover letter excerpts (recommended even if projecting)

**Pedagogical Preparation:**
- Review the Week 2 required readings (especially the HBR workslop article and Chremos framework)
- Think through your own AI use: What do YOU do as a pilot vs. passenger? Students will ask.
- Prepare real examples from Vietnamese business context (VinGroup, Masan, etc.) to make exercises relevant

**Common Student Questions to Anticipate:**
1. "Is it cheating to use AI for assignments?" (Answer: Not if used as thought partner, not replacement for thinking)
2. "Will my mentor know I used AI?" (Answer: Yes, if you produce workslop. They WANT you to use AI well.)
3. "Which AI tool is best?" (Answer: For career materials, all major tools work—choice matters less than your context engineering)
4. "What if I can't afford premium AI tools?" (Answer: Free tiers are sufficient for this course)

## Detailed Activity Facilitation

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Welcome & Framing:**
- "Today's tutorial is different—you'll be USING AI, not just learning about it"
- "Everything we practice today applies to your Mentorship Program starting this week"
- "The goal isn't perfection—it's developing judgment through experimentation"

**Technical Logistics:**
- Quick poll: "Who has an AI account ready?" (If <50%, have students pair up)
- "If you encounter technical issues, signal me—don't let tech problems derail your learning"
- Share WiFi password if needed

**Set Expectations:**
- "AI will sometimes give weird outputs—that's normal, we'll discuss why"
- "Partners will give each other feedback—be constructive"
- "Everything you create today is practice, not graded—experiment freely"

**Quick Review:**
- "Before we dive in, what's ONE concept from today's lecture that stuck with you?" (Take 2-3 responses)
- "Keep that concept in mind as we practice"

---

### Activity 1: Context Engineering Practice (25 minutes)

**Introduction (2 min):**
- "We'll write the SAME CV bullet point three times with different approaches"
- "This demonstrates why context matters more than clever prompting"
- "By the end, you'll see dramatically different outputs from the same experience"

#### Round 1: Passenger Approach (5 min)

**Demonstration (2 min):**
Project on screen and do this live with a sample experience:

```
Your prompt: "Write a CV bullet point about my group project."

AI output: "Successfully collaborated with team members to complete a comprehensive group project, demonstrating strong teamwork and communication skills."
```

- Ask class: "What's wrong with this?" (Generic, no specifics, templated, could apply to any project)
- "This is what passengers produce—and employers spot it immediately"

**Student Work Time (3 min):**
- "Now you try with one of YOUR experiences"
- "Keep your prompt intentionally vague—we're demonstrating what NOT to do"
- Circulate and observe:
  - Are students actually being vague, or over-explaining? Coach them to be minimal.
  - Note interesting examples to share during debrief

**Common Student Struggles:**
- Students uncomfortable "doing it wrong" intentionally
  - Coach: "This is experimentation—we WANT to see what fails"
- Students don't have experiences to draw from
  - Coach: "Use any group project, even from first semester. Or volunteer work, clubs, anything."

#### Round 2: Goldilocks Approach (10 min)

**Demonstration (3 min):**
Show side-by-side comparison:

```
Round 1 (Passenger): "Write a CV bullet point about my group project."

Round 2 (Goldilocks):
"I need a CV bullet point for a business administration application.

Context:
- Experience: Led a team of 4 students analyzing Vietnamese coffee shop consumer preferences
- Key achievement: Our recommendations helped a local shop increase customer retention by identifying underserved demographic (students seeking quiet study space)
- Skills demonstrated: Data analysis (surveys, Excel), teamwork, business application of research

Tone: Professional but approachable; emphasize both analytical skills and real-world impact
Format: Start with strong action verb, quantify where possible, keep under 25 words"

AI output: "Led 4-student team to analyze coffee shop consumer preferences, identifying underserved student demographic and recommending retention strategies that increased repeat visits by 30%."
```

- Ask class: "What made this output stronger?" (Specific, quantified, demonstrates impact, uses student's actual achievement)
- Point out: "Notice I gave AI strategic direction (tone, format) but let it choose exact words—that's the Goldilocks zone"

**Student Work Time (7 min):**
- "Rewrite your Round 1 prompt with strategic context"
- "Include: what the experience was, what you achieved, what skills you demonstrated"
- "Give tone/format guidance but don't dictate exact words"

**Tutor Circulation Tips:**
- Look for students giving TOO much direction ("Use exactly these words...") → Coach toward Goldilocks
- Look for students still being too vague → "What was the actual outcome of your project?"
- Celebrate good examples: "Can I share this with the class as a strong example?"

**Common Student Struggles:**
- Overthinking the prompt
  - Coach: "You're not writing a legal contract—give AI the key facts and strategic direction"
- Underselling their achievements
  - Coach: "What tangible result did your work produce? Even if small, quantify it."

#### Round 3: Minimum Effective Dose (5 min)

**Demonstration (1 min):**
- "The minimum effective dose principle asks: What's the SMALLEST amount of context that still produces excellent results?"
- Show streamlined version of Round 2 prompt
- "Experiment: Can you cut 30-40% of context and still get quality output?"

**Student Work Time (4 min):**
- "Streamline your Round 2 prompt"
- "Test if shorter context produces similar quality"
- "This builds your judgment about what information is actually necessary"

**Tutor Note:**
- This round is about calibration—there's no single "right" answer
- Some students will find they can cut a lot; others will find minimum dose = Goldilocks approach
- Goal: Students learn through experimentation what works for their specific task

#### Pair Evaluation (5 min)

**Instructions:**
- "Exchange all three outputs with your partner"
- "Apply the 30-Second Test to each: Does this sound like thoughtful human work or AI template?"
- "Which approach produced the best result?"

**Tutor Facilitation:**
- Circulate and listen to pair discussions
- Identify interesting insights to share with class
- Look for students who discovered counterintuitive results (e.g., minimal context worked well)

**Class Debrief (3 min):**
- "By show of hands: For how many of you did Goldilocks produce the best result?" (Expect majority)
- "Did anyone find Minimum Dose worked just as well?" (If yes: "What made that possible?")
- "What's the key lesson here?" (Desired answer: Strategic context matters more than prompt length)

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Context engineering isn't about writing longer prompts—it's about exercising JUDGMENT about what information matters. That judgment develops through practice, which is why we're experimenting today."

---

### Activity 2: Workslop Detection Challenge (20 minutes)

**Introduction (2 min):**
- "Now we're switching from creation to evaluation"
- "You'll read four cover letter excerpts—two are workslop, two are piloted"
- "Your job: detect which is which and explain the evidence"
- "This skill protects you from accidentally PRODUCING workslop"

**Distribute/Project Excerpts (1 min):**
- Either project all four excerpts on screen OR
- Distribute printed handouts (recommended—easier for students to compare)
- Ensure students can see all four simultaneously

#### Individual Analysis (5 min)

**Instructions:**
- "Read all four silently"
- "Identify the two workslop excerpts"
- "For each, note specific evidence: What makes it AI-generated? What's missing?"

**Tutor Observation:**
- Circulate silently—don't give hints yet
- Note which excerpts students struggle to identify (this reveals where they need coaching)
- Some students will finish quickly—coach them: "Now identify what makes the GOOD ones strong"

**Common Student Struggles:**
- Students drawn to polished-sounding language (which is often workslop)
  - This is the learning opportunity—they'll discover in debrief that polish ≠ quality
- Students assume longer = better
  - Again, debrief will reveal that workslop often uses more words to say less

#### Pair Discussion (5 min)

**Instructions:**
- "Compare identifications with your partner"
- "If you disagreed, debate the evidence"
- "For the piloted excerpts, identify what makes them stronger"

**Tutor Facilitation:**
- Listen for productive disagreements (these make great class discussion points)
- Note: If a pair is stuck because both identified wrong excerpts, gently ask: "What specific details in Excerpt B make it feel personal vs. templated?"

#### Class Debrief (10 min)

**Reveal Answers:**
- "Excerpts A and C are workslop. B and D are piloted."
- "Let's break down the evidence..."

**Excerpt A Analysis (Workslop):**
Project excerpt and annotate on screen while discussing:
- Circle "express my strong interest" → "This phrase appears in thousands of cover letters"
- Underline "innovative approach" → "Generic praise, no specifics"
- Highlight "ideal candidate" → "Cliché, everyone says this"

Ask class: "Could you copy-paste this to a different company and it would still work?" (Yes = workslop)

**Excerpt C Analysis (Workslop):**
- "What SPECIFIC information does this tell the employer about the student?" (Almost nothing)
- "What makes this different from any other business student's cover letter?" (Nothing)
- "If you received 100 applications and 50 sounded like this, how would you feel?" (Frustrated, dismissive)

**Excerpt B Analysis (Piloted):**
- "What specific detail makes this memorable?" (VinFast showroom visit on weekend)
- "What does this tell you about the student beyond their CV?" (Takes initiative, thinks strategically, observes business practices)
- "Could this student have written this without doing actual research?" (No—requires real knowledge)

**Excerpt D Analysis (Piloted):**
- "What makes this feel authentic vs. AI-generated?" (Personal anecdote about professor, specific project numbers, cultural insight)
- "What does the comparison of email vs. face-to-face surveys demonstrate?" (Critical thinking, adaptability, research skills)

**Critical Discussion Questions:**
1. "What surprises you about what counts as workslop vs. quality?"
2. "Have you ever submitted something that, looking back, might have been workslop?" (Expect honest yes from many—this is growth)
3. "How can you ensure YOUR cover letters don't sound like Excerpts A and C?"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Workslop looks polished but lacks substance—it's surface-level professionalism
- Piloted content has SPECIFICITY: real details, personal voice, evidence of thinking
- The 30-Second Test catches workslop: Would you bet your reputation on this?

**Vietnamese Cultural Context Note:**
- In Vietnamese professional culture, demonstrating thorough preparation and genuine interest is highly valued
- Workslop signals lack of effort—culturally disrespectful
- Piloted content shows you've invested time understanding the opportunity—culturally appropriate

**Bridge to Activity 3:**
"Now that you can detect workslop, let's ensure you don't produce it. Activity 3 gives you a framework for AI-assisted work that ALWAYS passes the 30-Second Test."

---

### Activity 3: Explore-Build-Connect-Refine Application (35 minutes)

**Introduction (2 min):**
- "This is the most practical activity—you're creating a real artifact you'll use THIS WEEK"
- "We're building a 60-second elevator pitch using the four-stage framework"
- "Each stage has a specific purpose; you'll see how they build on each other"

#### Stage 1: EXPLORE (8 min)

**Framing (1 min):**
- "EXPLORE is about expanding your awareness before you create anything"
- "Passengers skip this stage and jump straight to 'AI, write my pitch'—that produces workslop"
- "Pilots EXPLORE first: What do I need to know before crafting my message?"

**Demonstration (2 min):**
Show a live AI interaction:

```
Your prompt: "I'm a second-year business student interested in sustainability and corporate social responsibility. What are 5 different career pathways that combine business strategy with social impact in Vietnam?"

AI response: [Generates list of pathways like: impact investing, CSR consulting, social enterprise management, sustainable supply chain, ESG reporting/compliance]

Your follow-up: "For corporate CSR roles at Vietnamese companies like VinGroup or Vinamilk, what skills do job descriptions typically emphasize?"

AI response: [Generates skills list]
```

- "Notice: I'm not asking AI to create anything yet—I'm using AI to RESEARCH and expand my thinking"
- "This is piloting: I set the research agenda, AI provides information, I synthesize insights"

**Student Work Time (5 min):**
- "Choose 1-2 EXPLORE prompts from your tutorial handout (or create your own)"
- "Goal: Identify 2-3 insights that surprised you + one skill gap you need to address"
- "Document these—they'll inform your pitch in BUILD stage"

**Tutor Circulation:**
- Look for students asking AI to make decisions FOR them ("What career should I pursue?")
  - Coach: "That's a passenger question. Pilot question: 'Given my interests in X and Y, what industries are hiring?'"
- Celebrate good EXPLORE questions that demonstrate curiosity and strategic thinking
- For students stuck: "What industry are you curious about? Let's craft an EXPLORE prompt together."

**Quick Insight Sharing (1 min):**
- "Who learned something surprising during EXPLORE?" (Take 1-2 quick shares)
- Purpose: Validate that EXPLORE adds value; model the experimentation mindset

#### Stage 2: BUILD (10 min)

**Framing (1 min):**
- "Now we BUILD your actual elevator pitch"
- "You'll do this in three steps: brain dump, AI draft, refine for voice"
- "Each step serves a purpose—don't skip straight to AI draft"

**Step 1: Brain Dump (2 min):**
- "Take rough notes answering: Who am I? What interests me? What experience/skills do I have? What am I seeking?"
- "Don't worry about polish—bullet points are fine"
- Tutor: Circulate and ensure students are actually writing (some will skip this—redirect them)

**Step 2: AI First Draft (3 min):**

**Demonstration:**
Project a sample prompt:

```
I need a 60-second elevator pitch for an informational interview with a marketing manager.

About me:
- Second-year BBA student at NEU
- Interested in digital marketing and consumer behavior
- Led social media project for student club, increased engagement 40%
- Want to learn about career pathways in marketing analytics

Tone: Professional but approachable, enthusiastic about learning
Audience: Senior marketing professional at consumer goods company

Draft a pitch that sounds conversational, includes one specific detail that makes me memorable, and ends with a clear ask for a 20-minute informational interview.
```

- "Notice: I provided my brain dump + strategic direction (tone, audience, goals)"
- "I'm piloting: AI helps structure, but the CONTENT comes from my actual experiences"

**Student Work Time:**
- "Use your brain dump to create your AI prompt"
- "Generate first draft"
- Tutor: Watch for students copy-pasting AI output without reading it—remind them of Step 3

**Step 3: Refine for Voice (4 min):**
- "Read AI's draft out loud"
- "Circle phrases that don't sound like YOU"
- "Rewrite to make it conversational—like you're actually talking to someone"

**Tutor Coaching:**
- Students often struggle to identify what sounds "off"—help them:
  - "Would you actually say 'leverage my skills' in conversation? Or would you say 'use my skills'?"
  - "Is that sentence too long to say in one breath? Break it up."
- Common issue: Students make pitch too formal
  - "This is a conversation, not a speech. Relax the language."

**Checkpoint:**
- "Who has a draft they feel decent about?" (Expect ~60% hands)
- "Who's still working?" (That's fine—finish during CONNECT stage)

#### Stage 3: CONNECT (7 min)

**Framing (1 min):**
- "CONNECT tests your pitch with simulated audiences"
- "AI will roleplay a professional and ask you follow-up questions"
- "This reveals gaps in your preparation"

**Demonstration (2 min):**
Show live AI roleplay:

```
Your prompt: "Roleplay: You are a senior marketing manager at Masan Group. I'm going to deliver my elevator pitch. After, ask 2-3 realistic follow-up questions and provide feedback."

[You deliver pitch]

AI response: "Thanks for the introduction. A few questions: (1) You mentioned increasing social media engagement by 40%—what metrics did you use to measure that? (2) What specific aspect of marketing analytics interests you most—customer segmentation, campaign optimization, or something else? (3) Have you looked into any certifications like Google Analytics?"

Feedback: "Your pitch was clear and I appreciated the specific 40% metric. However, you could strengthen it by..."
```

- "Notice: AI asked reasonable questions a real professional would ask"
- "This helps me prepare—I should have answers ready for similar questions"

**Student Work Time (4 min):**
- "Run your pitch through AI roleplay with at least one professional persona"
- "Note questions they ask—are you prepared to answer in a real conversation?"

**Pair Practice:**
- "Deliver your pitch to your partner out loud, as if they're the professional"
- "Partner feedback: Does it sound natural? What's memorable? Is the ask clear?"
- Switch roles

**Tutor Facilitation:**
- Listen to pairs practicing—this is where you hear authenticity (or lack thereof)
- Coach students reading their pitch like a script: "You're having a conversation. Make eye contact. Sound human."
- Celebrate students whose pitches sound genuinely conversational

#### Stage 4: REFINE (10 min)

**Framing (1 min):**
- "REFINE is where you apply the 30-Second Test"
- "Would a busy professional hear this and think you're thoughtful—or generic?"

**Refinement Checklist Walk-Through (3 min):**
Project the checklist (from tutorial handout) and explain each item:

- **Specificity Test:** "Is there at least one detail that makes you memorable?"
  - Example: Not "I'm interested in marketing" but "I increased social media engagement 40% using A/B testing"

- **Voice Test:** "Would someone who knows you recognize this as YOUR voice?"
  - Read pitch out loud—does it sound like you talking?

- **Jargon Test:** "Eliminate business jargon you wouldn't naturally use"
  - "Leverage," "synergy," "strategic alignment"—do you actually talk like this?

- **Clarity Test:** "Is your ask crystal clear?"
  - Not "I'd love to learn more" but "Could I schedule a 20-minute informational interview?"

- **Length Test:** "Is it 50-70 seconds when spoken at conversational pace?"
  - Time yourself—too long = you'll rush; too short = missed opportunity

- **Authenticity Test:** "Does this reflect genuine interest or generic aspirations?"
  - "I'm passionate about business" (generic) vs. "I'm fascinated by how VinGroup balances global business practices with Vietnamese market realities" (genuine)

**AI-Assisted Pressure Test (2 min):**
- "Ask AI to critique your pitch as a skeptical hiring manager would"
- "AI will identify weaknesses you might have missed"

**Student Work Time (4 min):**
- "Run through the refinement checklist"
- "Get AI critique"
- "Make final adjustments"
- "Practice delivering one more time"

**Tutor Circulation:**
- This is final quality check—listen to students practicing
- If you hear workslop (generic, templated, lacking specifics), provide direct feedback:
  - "That phrase 'passionate about learning' appears in every pitch. What SPECIFICALLY interests you about this field?"
- If you hear strong pitches, affirm: "That's exactly right—specific, authentic, clear ask."

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to deliver their pitch to the class (only if time permits and students willing)
- Class provides constructive feedback using 30-Second Test
- Tutor models: "What I liked: [specific detail]. What could be stronger: [constructive suggestion]."

### Reflection & Action Planning (10 minutes)

**Transition:**
- "We've practiced context engineering, detected workslop, and applied the four-stage framework"
- "Now: metacognition. What did you LEARN about your own AI use?"

**Individual Reflection (5 min):**

**Instructions:**
- "Answer the four reflection questions in your notes" (from tutorial handout)
- "Be honest—this reflection helps with your Mentorship Program reflections"
- Silence while students write

**Tutor Notes:**
- Resist urge to fill silence—give students time to think
- Circulate and read over shoulders (respectfully) to gauge understanding
- If students struggling with Question 3 (identifying their Explore-Build-Connect-Refine gap), provide coaching:
  - EXPLORE gap: "You don't research enough before creating"
  - BUILD gap: "You struggle with execution/drafting"
  - CONNECT gap: "Networking/communication intimidates you"
  - REFINE gap: "You submit first drafts without quality control"

**Brief Pair Share (2 min):**
- "Share with your partner: Which framework stage is YOUR gap?"
- "What's one specific action you'll take to address it?"
- Purpose: Peer accountability; students more likely to follow through when they've verbalized commitment

**Action Planning (3 min):**

**Instructions:**
- "Look at the Action Planning checklist" (tutorial handout)
- "Check off what you'll commit to doing before your first mentor meeting"
- "These aren't theoretical—you have a mentor meeting THIS WEEK or next"

**Tutor Emphasis:**
- "Everything we practiced today applies immediately to Mentorship Program"
- "Your mentor will notice if you've prepared using these frameworks vs. showing up with generic questions"
- "Use EXPLORE-BUILD-CONNECT-REFINE for EVERY mentor meeting prep"

---

### Closing (5 minutes)

**Key Takeaways Review:**
- "What's the #1 thing you'll remember from today?" (Popcorn style—quick responses from multiple students)
- Listen for: context engineering, workslop awareness, pilot vs. passenger, 30-Second Test
- If key concepts missing, prompt: "What about the difference between pilots and passengers?"

**Normalize the Learning Curve:**
- "You won't master AI use today—that's okay"
- "Judgment develops through practice and experimentation"
- "Every time you use AI this semester, ask yourself: Am I piloting or passengering?"

**Connect to Next Week:**
- "Week 3 is about Reflection and Reflective Learning—Gibbs' Cycle, Kolb's Cycle"
- "Those frameworks help you extract insights from experiences like TODAY'S tutorial"
- "The reflection skills you'll learn apply directly to Mentorship Program reflections"

**Final Encouragement:**
- "The fact that you're learning these skills in second year puts you ahead of 95% of professionals"
- "Your competition isn't AI—it's other humans who don't know how to work with AI strategically"
- "You now have the frameworks. Go practice."

**Logistics:**
- Remind about Week 2 readings if not completed
- Office hours available for questions
- "See you next week!"

## Timing Guide

| Activity | Planned Time | Actual Time | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Opening | 5 min | | |
| Activity 1: Context Engineering | 25 min | | Most likely to run over—watch clock |
| Activity 2: Workslop Detection | 20 min | | Debrief is critical, don't rush |
| Activity 3: EBCR Framework | 35 min | | Can compress CONNECT if needed |
| Reflection & Action Planning | 10 min | | Don't skip—metacognition matters |
| Closing | 5 min | | Buffer for overruns |
| **Total** | **90 min** | | |

**Timing Tips:**
- Activities 1 and 3 will likely run over—that's okay, they're most valuable
- If running short on time, compress CONNECT stage (pair practice is most essential part)
- Never skip REFINE—it's where workslop gets caught
- Build in 2-3 min buffer for technical troubleshooting

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technical Issues

**Problem: WiFi can't handle 30+ students on AI tools simultaneously**
- Solution 1: Have students work in pairs sharing one device
- Solution 2: Use printed workslop excerpts for Activity 2 (no AI needed)
- Solution 3: Demonstrate on your device while students follow along without generating (less ideal)

**Problem: Student's AI account isn't working**
- Quick fix: Pair them with working student
- Alternative: Create class demo account students can use
- Last resort: Student observes and practices at home later

**Problem: AI tool giving bizarre/inappropriate responses**
- Normalize: "AI sometimes does weird things—this is why we need judgment"
- Teaching opportunity: "This is exactly why you can't blindly trust AI outputs"
- Redirect: "Let's try rephrasing your prompt"

### Pedagogical Issues

**Problem: Students producing workslop and don't realize it**
- Intervention: Apply 30-Second Test verbally
- Ask: "If I read this for 30 seconds, would I think a human thought carefully about this?"
- Provide specific feedback: "This phrase is templated. What would YOU actually say?"

**Problem: Students too intimidated to experiment**
- Normalize failure: "I want you to produce some bad outputs today—that's how you learn"
- Share your own AI failures: "I once asked AI to... and it completely misunderstood"
- Emphasize: "Nothing today is graded. This is a safe space to mess up."

**Problem: Students treating AI as magic answer generator**
- Redirect to pilot mindset: "What do YOU think should go in this pitch before asking AI?"
- Remove AI temporarily: "Draft your pitch without AI first, THEN use AI to refine"
- Emphasize: "AI amplifies your thinking—but YOU have to think first"

**Problem: Advanced students finishing early and disengaging**
- Extension activities:
  - "Experiment with different AI tools and compare outputs"
  - "Help a classmate refine their pitch"
  - "Draft a cover letter using same framework"
- Ask them to identify which REFINE checklist item is hardest for most students (metacognitive task)

**Problem: Struggling students falling behind**
- Triage: Identify if it's technical issue or conceptual confusion
- Technical: Pair with working student
- Conceptual: Provide one-on-one coaching during work time
- If many students struggling: Stop class, re-explain concept, restart activity

### Cultural Considerations

**Vietnamese Student Context:**
- Students may be reluctant to self-promote in elevator pitch (cultural humility)
  - Frame: "Professional communication in international business requires confidence. Practice here."
- Students may hesitate to criticize peers' work in pair evaluation
  - Model: "Constructive feedback is a gift. Be specific and kind."
- Students may default to formal, respectful language even when inappropriate for task
  - Coach: "Elevator pitch is conversational. You can be respectful AND casual."

**Gender Dynamics:**
- If female students consistently understate achievements: "What you call 'helping' was actually LEADING. Own it."
- If male students dominating pair discussions: Circulate to ensure balanced participation

## Emergency Backup Plan

**If Technology Completely Fails:**

**Activity 1 Alternative (No AI):**
- Students write three versions of CV bullet manually
- Pair feedback on which sounds most professional
- Class discussion on what makes good CV bullets
- Less impactful but still teaches critical evaluation

**Activity 2 Alternative (No AI):**
- Workslop detection works WITHOUT AI (just need printed excerpts)
- Proceed as planned with pair analysis and class debrief
- This activity is tech-independent

**Activity 3 Alternative (No AI):**
- Students draft elevator pitch manually using framework
- Pair practice and feedback (no AI roleplay)
- Focus on REFINE checklist and 30-Second Test
- Less practice but core skill still developed

**Key Principle:**
The pedagogy (pilot vs. passenger mindset, 30-Second Test, strategic thinking) can be taught even without functional AI tools. Technology enhances but doesn't replace the core learning objectives.

**Tutorial Preparation Complete**

You're ready to facilitate an engaging, practical tutorial that builds essential AI literacy for career development. Remember:
- Normalize experimentation and failure
- Emphasize judgment over technical skill
- Connect every activity to students' immediate needs (Mentorship Program starting this week)
- Model the pilot mindset in your own teaching

Good luck!
