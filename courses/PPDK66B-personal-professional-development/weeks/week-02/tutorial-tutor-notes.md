## Preparation Before Tutorial

### Materials You Need
1. Access to GenAI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini—verify which tool(s) students have access to)
2. Example job postings from Vietnamese job market (2-3 backup examples in case students don't bring their own)
3. Sample prompts demonstrating pilot vs. passenger approaches (see below)
4. Checklist for 30-Second Test evaluation

### Technical Setup
- Confirm students have AI tool access BEFORE tutorial starts
- Have backup plan if university network blocks certain AI tools
- Know how to help students with basic prompt engineering if they're new to GenAI tools

### Cultural Context
- Many Vietnamese students will be unfamiliar with elevator pitches (not common in local business culture)
- Some may feel uncomfortable with "self-promotion" in cover letters
- Group discussion about authenticity vs. modesty may be needed

---

## Stage-by-Stage Guidance

### Stage 1: Explore (5-20 min)

**What Students Should Be Doing:**
- Finding a real job posting relevant to their career interests
- Extracting 3-5 key requirements from job description
- Listing their own background (courses, experiences, skills)
- Using AI to analyze skill gaps and identify strengths

**Common Problems You'll See:**

**Problem 1: Too vague**
Student prompt: "What skills do I need for marketing jobs?"
→ **Intervention:** "Let's make this more specific. What's the actual company and role you're targeting? What does the job posting emphasize?"

**Problem 2: No context provided**
Student prompt: "Analyze this job description" [pastes only job description, no personal background]
→ **Intervention:** "AI needs to know YOUR background to identify gaps. What coursework and experiences do you have? Add that context."

**Problem 3: Asking AI to decide**
Student prompt: "Should I apply for this job?"
→ **Intervention:** "That's a judgment call only you can make. Instead, ask AI to help you analyze whether your background aligns with requirements. YOU decide if it's a good fit."

**What Good Work Looks Like:**
Student provides: job posting + their background + specific analytical questions ("What competencies align? Where are gaps? What should I emphasize?")
Student receives: Specific analysis they can use to inform their strategy
Student decides: Which experiences to highlight based on analysis

---

### Stage 2: Build (20-50 min)

**This is the CRITICAL intervention period.** Most students will default to passenger mode. Your job is to catch this and redirect.

**What Students Should Be Doing:**
- Crafting strategic prompts with rich context
- Using AI to brainstorm approaches and suggest structures
- WRITING their own content informed by AI insights
- Applying judgment about which suggestions to accept/reject

**Common Problems You'll See:**

**Problem 1: The "Write it for me" request**
Student prompt: "Write a cover letter for this job" [pastes job description]
→ **Intervention Script:**
"Pause. That's passenger mode—you're asking AI to do the thinking. Let's shift to pilot mode. What do YOU think are the 2-3 most important things this employer needs to know about you? Start there, then ask AI to help you articulate those points clearly."

**Problem 2: Accepting AI output without judgment**
Student generates a CV section with AI, considers it done.
→ **Intervention Script:**
"Read this aloud to me. Does it sound like you? Would your friends recognize your voice here? What would YOU change to make it more authentic?"

**Problem 3: Generic, workslop-quality output**
Student's cover letter starts with: "I am writing to express my strong interest in the position..."
→ **Intervention Script:**
"Let's apply the 30-Second Test. If a hiring manager reads this opening, what do they learn about you specifically? What makes you different from 500 other applicants? How can we make this opening immediately distinctive?"

**Problem 4: No metrics or specifics**
Student's CV says: "Led successful marketing campaign"
→ **Intervention Script:**
"This needs specifics to be credible. What was the campaign? What metrics show success? If you increased engagement, by what percentage? If you can't quantify, describe the impact in concrete terms."

**Problem 5: Poor context engineering**
Student gives AI minimal context, gets generic output, concludes "AI isn't helpful"
→ **Intervention Script:**
"Let's try again with better context engineering. Tell AI: the company values [X based on your research], you're emphasizing [Y experience], and you want to demonstrate [Z quality]. Now what does AI suggest?"

**What Good Work Looks Like:**
- Student provides rich context (company research, specific experiences, genuine motivations)
- Student asks AI to brainstorm approaches or suggest improvements
- Student WRITES content themselves, incorporating AI insights
- Student can explain: "AI suggested X, but I chose Y because..."
- Output passes 30-Second Test (specific, authentic, strategic)

**Facilitation Strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Side-by-Side Comparison**
Show two approaches on projector:
- Passenger: "Write a cover letter for [job]"
- Pilot: "I want to emphasize [experience] to demonstrate [quality] for [company]. Help me brainstorm 3 opening approaches."

Ask: "What's the difference? Which shows judgment?"

**Strategy 2: Read-Aloud Test**
When you suspect workslop, ask student to read their draft aloud. Often they'll self-identify: "Actually, this doesn't sound like me..."

**Strategy 3: Peer Review Pairs**
Have students swap materials and apply 30-Second Test to each other's work. Peer feedback is often more powerful than tutor feedback.

---

### Stage 3: Connect (50-70 min)

**What Students Should Be Doing:**
- Drafting elevator pitch that's concise, clear, memorable
- Using AI roleplay to practice delivery and handling follow-up questions
- Revising based on feedback from AI interaction

**Common Problems You'll See:**

**Problem 1: Overly formal or scripted pitch**
Student's pitch sounds like they're reading from a corporate brochure
→ **Intervention Script:**
"Imagine you're at a coffee shop and someone asks what you're studying and what you want to do. How would you actually answer? Start there—conversational, not corporate."

**Problem 2: Not actually practicing aloud**
Student types pitch, types responses to AI, never speaks
→ **Intervention Script:**
"Stand up. Deliver this pitch to me as if I'm a recruiter. Time yourself—60 seconds. Go."
[This is culturally challenging for some Vietnamese students, but essential]

**Problem 3: Pitch lacks specific hook**
Student says: "I'm a BBA student interested in marketing"
→ **Intervention Script:**
"That describes 1000 students. What makes YOU distinctive? What specific project or achievement could you mention in 10 seconds that shows your capability?"

**Cultural Sensitivity Note:**
Vietnamese business culture emphasizes modesty. Students may struggle with "selling themselves." Frame it as: "You're not bragging—you're helping the recruiter understand how you can contribute. That's respect for their time."

**What Good Work Looks Like:**
- Pitch is conversational, not scripted
- Includes specific hook (achievement, project, unique angle)
- Student can deliver it naturally in ~60 seconds
- Student has practiced with AI roleplay and revised based on feedback
- Pitch invites conversation (ends with question or clear next step)

---

### Stage 4: Refine (70-80 min)

**What Students Should Be Doing:**
- Using AI to critique their own work harshly
- Applying 30-Second Test rigorously
- Verifying factual claims
- Making revisions based on critique

**Common Problems You'll See:**

**Problem 1: Defensive about AI critique**
Student gets AI feedback identifying weaknesses, dismisses it
→ **Intervention Script:**
"AI is giving you the harsh feedback a hiring manager would think but not tell you. This is your chance to fix problems before real stakes. What's one thing you'll change based on this feedback?"

**Problem 2: Not actually revising**
Student runs critique, reads feedback, considers task done
→ **Intervention Script:**
"Show me what you're changing. I want to see before and after. What specific words or phrases are you revising?"

**Problem 3: Skipping verification**
Student makes claims about company or industry without checking
→ **Intervention Script:**
"How do you know that's accurate? Show me where you verified this. AI hallucinates—you must check facts against primary sources."

**What Good Work Looks Like:**
- Student can point to specific revisions made after AI critique
- Materials pass 30-Second Test when read cold by tutor or peer
- All factual claims verified
- Student can explain: "I changed X because it was generic/unsupported/inauthentic"

---

## Evaluation Criteria for Student Work

**Excellent (Pilot Mindset Demonstrated):**
- Materials show clear strategic thinking aligned with job requirements
- Specific examples with metrics/details demonstrating real experiences
- Authentic voice (sounds like a real person, not AI)
- Evidence of judgment: student can explain choices and tradeoffs
- Passes 30-Second Test easily

**Satisfactory (Mixed Pilot/Passenger):**
- Materials show some strategic thinking but occasional generic phrasing
- Mix of specific and vague claims
- Mostly authentic but some AI-ish passages
- Student can explain some choices but not all
- Passes 30-Second Test with minor concerns

**Unsatisfactory (Passenger Mindset):**
- Generic materials that could apply to any job/company
- Vague claims without supporting details
- AI-generated voice throughout (formal, stilted, buzzword-heavy)
- Student cannot explain choices ("AI said to write it this way")
- Fails 30-Second Test (obvious workslop)

**Intervention for Unsatisfactory Work:**
Don't let students leave tutorial with passenger-mode work. Require one round of revision before moving on.

## Valid Approaches to the Task

Students can succeed with different strategies. Here are 3-5 legitimate approaches:

### Approach 1: Industry-Focused Strategy
- Student selects job in specific industry (e.g., fintech)
- Uses AI to research industry norms and expectations
- Tailors all materials to demonstrate industry awareness
- **Strengths:** Shows depth of research; demonstrates genuine interest
- **When this works:** Student has clear industry target and can articulate why

### Approach 2: Skills-Emphasis Strategy
- Student identifies 2-3 core competencies they've developed
- Uses AI to help articulate these skills with evidence
- Structures materials around demonstrating these capabilities
- **Strengths:** Works well for students with diverse experiences; shows self-awareness
- **When this works:** Student has concrete projects/experiences demonstrating skills

### Approach 3: Story-Driven Strategy
- Student identifies compelling personal/professional narrative
- Uses AI to help structure and refine storytelling
- Materials connect experiences into coherent career arc
- **Strengths:** Memorable; builds emotional connection; shows reflection
- **When this works:** Student has interesting experiences to draw on and can articulate learning

### Approach 4: Problem-Solution Strategy
- Student identifies specific problem the target company/role addresses
- Uses AI to research problem and solution landscape
- Materials position student as someone who understands and can help solve problem
- **Strengths:** Demonstrates business thinking; shows initiative
- **When this works:** Student has researched company/industry enough to identify real challenges

### Approach 5: Comparison-Contrast Strategy
- Student identifies what makes them different from typical candidates
- Uses AI to help articulate distinctive angle
- Materials emphasize unique background, perspective, or capability
- **Strengths:** Differentiates from competition; memorable
- **When this works:** Student genuinely has distinctive background (e.g., unusual combination of experiences)

**All five approaches can work IF:**
- Student applies pilot mindset (strategic direction, judgment)
- Student practices good context engineering (specific, curated information)
- Student avoids workslop (applies 30-Second Test)

**Your job:** Identify which approach each student is attempting and help them execute it well. Don't force everyone into the same template.

## Facilitation Tips

### Managing the Room

**Early Tutorial (0-20 min):**
- Students will work at different paces—that's fine
- Quick verbal check: "Who has selected their target job? Who needs help finding one?"
- Have 2-3 backup job postings ready for students who struggle to find one

**Mid Tutorial (20-50 min):**
- This is when passenger mode emerges—circulate actively
- Listen for: "Can you write..." → Red flag
- Watch for: Students copy-pasting large AI outputs directly → Intervene
- Encourage: Students discussing their prompts and AI responses with neighbors

**Late Tutorial (50-80 min):**
- Energy may flag—do a quick energizer if needed
- Encourage peer review: "Swap your elevator pitch with a neighbor—does it sound authentic?"
- Some students will finish early—have extension activity: "Apply these same frameworks to your LinkedIn profile summary"

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is it okay to use AI for this? Isn't that cheating?"**
A: "Using AI as a thought partner is not cheating—it's the professional skill we're developing. What would be problematic is having AI generate materials without your judgment or passing off AI's ideas as your own without understanding them. We're being transparent: you're using AI assistance, but YOU are making strategic decisions and ensuring quality."

**Q: "My AI output is really generic. Does that mean I'm bad at this?"**
A: "It means you're experiencing workslop firsthand! This is good learning. Now let's diagnose: Did you give AI enough specific context? Did you ask it to brainstorm approaches rather than write final content? Let's try again with better context engineering."

**Q: "Can I use AI in Assessment 1?"**
A: "Yes, using AI strategically and transparently is allowed and encouraged. The rubric evaluates whether you demonstrate judgment and strategic thinking—exactly what we're practicing today. Just make sure you're piloting the AI, not being a passenger."

**Q: "This is taking longer than I expected. Do I have to finish everything?"**
A: "Focus on quality over completion. It's better to do Stages 1-2 well than rush through all four stages producing workslop. The frameworks are more important than finishing every deliverable. You can apply Stage 3-4 to your materials outside class."

**Q: "The AI gave different suggestions than what I was thinking. Which should I follow?"**
A: "Perfect question! This is where judgment comes in. What are the tradeoffs? Why did AI suggest that approach? Why were you thinking differently? Often the best answer is synthesizing both—AI's suggestion plus your insight. You're the decision-maker, not AI."

## Cultural Considerations for Vietnamese Students

### Expected Challenges

**Challenge 1: Modesty vs. Self-Promotion**
Vietnamese culture values modesty; American-style cover letters and elevator pitches require explicit self-promotion. Students may feel uncomfortable.
→ **Frame it as:** "You're not bragging—you're providing evidence so the employer can make an informed decision. That's respectful and professional."

**Challenge 2: Unfamiliarity with Elevator Pitches**
Elevator pitches are not common in Vietnamese business culture.
→ **Provide cultural context:** "In Western business culture, you often have 60 seconds to introduce yourself at networking events. This is a practiced skill, not natural conversation. We're building this skill deliberately."

**Challenge 3: Reluctance to "Bother" Professionals**
Vietnamese students may feel it's presumptuous to reach out to professionals for informational interviews.
→ **Reframe:** "In international business culture, reaching out with genuine interest and specific questions is seen as respectful initiative, not presumption. Professionals often welcome these conversations."

**Challenge 4: Face-Saving Around Mistakes**
Students may be reluctant to share AI outputs that didn't work well.
→ **Normalize failure:** "Everyone in this room will get unhelpful AI outputs today—that's part of learning. The Chief Experimentation Officer mindset means we expect some experiments to fail. That's valuable data."

**Challenge 5: Group Work Preferences**
Vietnamese students often prefer collaborative learning.
→ **Build in pair work:** "Turn to a neighbor and compare your prompts. What context did they include that you didn't? What approach might you try based on their example?"

### Adapting Examples

When providing examples, use Vietnamese context where possible:
- Vietnamese companies (Viettel, VinGroup, Masan, etc.)
- Regional roles (SEA market analyst, Vietnam business development)
- Local cultural references students will recognize

But also prepare students for international applications:
- Acknowledge differences in CV formats (US vs. Vietnamese expectations)
- Note that elevator pitches are primarily for Western business contexts
- Explain that cover letter conventions vary by culture

## Troubleshooting Common Tutorial Issues

### Issue: Students don't have AI tool access
**Cause:** University network blocks tools, students don't have accounts
**Solution:** Prepare before tutorial by confirming access; have backup demo where you project your screen and students guide your prompts

### Issue: Students finish very quickly
**Cause:** They've accepted first AI output without applying judgment (passenger mode)
**Solution:** Spot check quality. Ask: "Read this aloud to me. Does it sound like you? Apply the 30-Second Test—does it have specific examples?" Require revision if workslop detected.

### Issue: Students are stuck and frustrated
**Cause:** AI giving unhelpful outputs, or students uncertain what "good" looks like
**Solution:** Do live demo with volunteer student. Project screen, craft prompt together, show thought process. Model pilot mindset out loud: "I'm choosing to emphasize X because... Let me ask AI about Y angle..."

### Issue: Time management failure
**Cause:** Students spending too long on Stage 1-2, rushing Stage 3-4
**Solution:** Give time warnings. At 35 minutes, announce: "You should be finishing Build stage and moving to Connect. If you're still on Explore, make a decision and move forward—you can iterate later."

### Issue: Students treating this as just another task
**Cause:** Not seeing connection to Assessment 1 or career outcomes
**Solution:** Make stakes explicit: "The materials you create today are REAL career documents you'll use. The skills you practice today directly support Assessment 1. This isn't hypothetical—this matters for your actual job search."

## Connection to Assessment 1

**Assessment 1: Personal Future Skills Plan (Due Week 4)**

Today's tutorial directly scaffolds Assessment 1:

**Context Engineering → Skill Development Planning**
Students must demonstrate HOW they'll develop skills. Context engineering principles apply: be specific (Minimum Effective Dose), provide clear direction (Goldilocks Zone), allocate limited time strategically (Attention Budget).

**Pilot vs. Passenger → Strategic Synthesis**
Assessment rubric evaluates "strategic synthesis." This requires pilot mindset—demonstrating judgment about which skills matter and why, not just listing AI-generated skill lists.

**30-Second Test → Authenticity**
Assessment must reflect student's authentic thinking. Materials that read like AI-generated templates will score poorly. The 30-Second Test applies directly.

**Explore-Build-Connect-Refine → Plan Structure**
This framework can organize the Assessment: Explore (current skills and gaps), Build (development strategies), Connect (networking/mentoring plans), Refine (evaluation criteria).

**Prompt students:** "The frameworks you're practicing today—context engineering, pilot mindset, 30-Second Test—apply directly to your Assessment 1. Use them when developing your Future Skills Plan."

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

After tutorial, consider:

**For students who struggled:**
- Offer office hours for one-on-one coaching on context engineering
- Share example prompts that demonstrate pilot mindset
- Provide feedback on draft materials if students submit them

**For students who excelled:**
- Acknowledge their work: "Your materials demonstrated excellent pilot mindset"
- Encourage them to help peers: "You've grasped this quickly—could you mentor others?"
- Suggest extension: "Apply these frameworks to your LinkedIn profile"

**For all students:**
- Remind about Assessment 1 connection
- Encourage continued experimentation (Chief Experimentation Officer mindset)
- Note that Week 3 will build on today's individual AI use to explore team dynamics

---

## Key Success Indicators

**You'll know the tutorial succeeded if:**
1. Students can articulate difference between pilot and passenger mindset
2. Students demonstrate discomfort with obvious workslop (their standards have risen)
3. Students apply 30-Second Test reflexively, not just when prompted
4. Students can explain strategic choices ("I emphasized X because...")
5. Students see AI as thought partner, not answer generator

**You'll know the tutorial needs adjustment if:**
- Most students accept first AI output without iteration
- Students can't explain why they made certain choices
- Materials are generic and interchangeable
- Students express "AI isn't helpful" (suggests context engineering problem)

---

## Tutor Reflection Questions (Post-Tutorial)

After tutorial, reflect:
1. What percentage of students demonstrated pilot vs. passenger mindset?
2. What intervention strategies were most effective?
3. Did cultural factors (modesty, face-saving, etc.) affect student engagement?
4. What would you change in timing or structure for next time?
5. Are students prepared to apply these frameworks to Assessment 1?

Share insights with other tutors to continuously improve facilitation.
