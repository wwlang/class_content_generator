**job seekers denied positions when AI use discovered in application materials**

*(HBR Research, Niederhoffer et al. 2025)*
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
AI can help you—or it can destroy your chances before you even get to the interview. This isn't about whether to use AI—it's about HOW you use it. Employers aren't banning AI use; they're rejecting LAZY AI use. The gap between effective and ineffective AI users determines career outcomes.

Example: Two candidates apply for the same internship. Both use ChatGPT. One gets the interview, the other gets rejected immediately. What's the difference?

Show of hands: How many have used ChatGPT for schoolwork? How many feel confident you used it WELL? Today we're learning what separates AI pilots from AI passengers—and which one employers want to hire.

# Career Skills in the AI Era
## Becoming a Pilot, Not a Passenger

**Week 2 Focus Areas:**
- Context engineering as the premium 2025 skill
- The "workslop" problem destroying productivity
- Judgment as the irreplaceable human skill
- Practical framework for AI-assisted career prep
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Last week we talked about the future of work and the skills employers value. Today we get specific: how do you actually BUILD those skills in an AI-saturated world? This week is intensely practical—you'll use real AI tools in tutorial. Everything we cover today applies to your Mentorship Program and Personal Development Plan. The skills you learn this week have immediate ROI: better CV, better cover letters, better interview prep.

Week 1 covered critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence as premium skills. Week 2 shows how to DEVELOP those skills while working alongside AI.

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** context engineering from prompt engineering
2. **Identify** the "workslop" problem and its professional impact
3. **Explain** why judgment is the critical AI-era skill
4. **Apply** the pilot vs. passenger mindset
5. **Use** the Explore-Build-Connect-Refine framework
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
These objectives are actionable—you'll practice all five in tutorial. Notice we're moving from knowledge (explain, identify) to application (apply, use). Objectives 1-3 are diagnostic: What's happening in the workplace? Objectives 4-5 are strategic: How do you position yourself for success?

By the end of tutorial, you'll have drafted a CV bullet using context engineering principles—not just theory. Your Mentorship Program requires reflective writing about career development. Your Personal Development Plan requires AI-assisted research on career pathways. These objectives ensure you use AI effectively in BOTH assessments.

# Part 1: Context Engineering
## The Premium Skill of 2025
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
In 2023, everyone talked about "prompt engineering." By 2025, that term is outdated. We're about to explore why this shift matters for your career development and how mastering context engineering gives you a competitive advantage in the job market.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="5" layout="content" title="From Prompts to Context">
    <content>
## The Shift: Prompts → Context

**2023: "Prompt Engineering"**
- Short task descriptions to models
- "Write me a cover letter for this job"
- Focus on clever phrasing and tricks

**2025: "Context Engineering"**
- Curating what AI sees in its context window
- Providing strategic information for AI to work with
- Focus on judgment about what matters

> "People associate prompts with short task descriptions... When in every industrial-strength LLM app, context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information."
> — **Andrej Karpathy** (Former Tesla AI Director, June 2025)
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Who here has heard "prompt engineering"? Who has heard "context engineering"? This shift is CRUCIAL to understand. AI models in 2025 are sophisticated enough that simple prompts aren't the bottleneck. The bottleneck is: What information does the AI have ACCESS to? Think of AI like a brilliant consultant hired for one hour—what do you brief them on?

BAD prompt engineering: "Write me a business cover letter." GOOD context engineering: Provide the AI with (1) the job description, (2) your actual experiences relevant to that role, (3) the company's mission statement, (4) specific projects you've worked on that match their needs. Result: AI generates a targeted first draft vs. generic template.

Analogy: Asking a friend to recommend a restaurant. Prompt approach: "Where should I eat?" Context approach: "I'm taking my parents out for their anniversary, they love Vietnamese fusion, they have a shellfish allergy, our budget is 500,000 VND per person, and we prefer quiet ambiance for conversation." Which gets a better recommendation?
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="6" layout="framework" title="The Goldilocks Principle">
    <content>
## Principle 1: The Goldilocks Zone

**Too Rigid:**
- "Use exactly these words: 'I am writing to express my interest...'"
- AI becomes brittle and robotic
- Output sounds obviously AI-generated

**Too Vague:**
- "Make it sound professional"
- AI makes unpredictable choices
- Output misses the mark

**Just Right:**
- "Adopt a confident but humble tone; emphasize collaboration"
- AI has creative freedom within strategic boundaries
- Output sounds authentically human-crafted

**Key Insight:** Find the optimal "altitude" between overly specific and overly general
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
You know the Goldilocks story—not too hot, not too cold, just right. Same principle applies to AI instructions. Students often make two mistakes: over-controlling AI (trying to dictate every word) resulting in robotic output, or under-guiding AI (no strategic direction) resulting in generic, off-target content. The sweet spot: Give AI strategic constraints but room to write naturally.

Real example: Too rigid: "Start with 'Dear Hiring Manager' and use the word 'synergy' in the second paragraph." Too vague: "Write a good cover letter." Just right: "Write a cover letter that demonstrates both technical competence and cultural fit. The company values innovation and collaboration—show how my internship project exemplifies both."

Students often think more detailed instructions equal better output. Actually, over-specification leads to stilted, obviously AI-written content. Judgment is required to find the Goldilocks zone.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="7" layout="content" title="Minimum Effective Dose">
    <content>
## Principle 2: Minimum Effective Dose

**The Principle:**
> "Find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of some desired outcome"
> — **Anthropic Engineering Team** (2025)

**What This Means:**
- More information ≠ better results
- Strategic selection > comprehensive dumping
- AI has limited "attention"—use it wisely

**Application to Career Documents:**
- DON'T: Copy your entire academic transcript + every course description + all club activities into AI
- DO: Curate the 3-5 most relevant experiences that match the job requirements

**Why This Matters:**
- Dumping everything dilutes what's important
- AI struggles to identify what matters most
- You maintain strategic control
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
This principle goes against student instincts. You think: "If I give AI MORE information, the output will be better." That's often wrong. The phrase "minimum effective dose" comes from medicine. A doctor doesn't prescribe maximum medication—they prescribe the MINIMUM dose that achieves the therapeutic effect. Same with AI: minimum information that achieves your communication goal.

Example: Student applying for marketing internship at VinGroup. Has experiences in: business club, volunteer teaching, data analytics course, social media project, part-time retail job. Minimum effective dose: social media project (directly relevant) + data analytics (demonstrates analytical thinking valued in marketing). DON'T include: volunteer teaching (unless the role involves education), retail job (generic), business club (unless specific relevant project).

Students have been trained to be comprehensive in academic work. Business communication requires CURATION, not comprehensiveness. Context engineering equals exercising judgment about what matters.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="8" layout="content" title="The Attention Budget">
    <content>
## Principle 3: The Attention Budget

**The Concept:**
- LLMs have finite attention that "gets stretched thin" with larger contexts
- Like human working memory—you can only focus on so much at once
- Context is a precious, finite resource with diminishing returns

**Practical Implications:**

| Context Size | AI Performance | Your Strategy |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| 200 words | Highly focused | Ideal for specific tasks |
| 1,000 words | Balanced | Good for complex documents |
| 5,000 words | Attention dilution begins | Only if truly necessary |
| 20,000 words | Significant degradation | Avoid—break into chunks |

**Key Takeaway:** Be selective, not comprehensive
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Think of AI's context window like your own working memory during an exam. If I gave you 5 essay questions, you'd perform better than if I gave you 50—even if you only have to answer 5. Why? Cognitive load. AI has the same limitation.

Anthropic's research shows attention degradation with longer contexts. This isn't a technological limitation to be fixed—it's inherent to how these models work. Students who understand this have a competitive advantage.

Practical demonstration: You need AI to help tailor your CV for a specific job. Option A: Paste the 10-page job description, your full CV, company annual report, LinkedIn profile. Option B: Extract the 5 key requirements from job description, select the 3 most relevant CV experiences, identify company's stated mission. Option B will produce better results despite less information.

This is WHY executives value concision—it's not just about saving time. Focused information enables better decision-making (whether human or AI is deciding). You're developing executive communication habits.

# Part 2: The Workslop Problem
## Why Bad AI Use Destroys Careers
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
We've covered the positive—how to use AI well. Now we need to talk about the serious risks of using it poorly. This section might make you uncomfortable. That's intentional. The stakes are high. Understanding what NOT to do is just as important as knowing best practices.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="10" layout="content" title="What Is Workslop">
    <content>
## Introducing "Workslop"

**Definition:**
AI-generated content that appears polished but lacks real substance, insight, or authentic human thinking

**The Experience:**
> "You might recall the feeling of confusion after opening such a document, followed by frustration"
> — **Niederhoffer et al., HBR (2025)**

**Characteristics:**
- Superficially professional formatting
- Generic, templated language
- No specific insights or original thinking
- Obvious lack of human judgment
- Recipient knows immediately something is "off"
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Has anyone received an email that looked professional but when you read it, you realized the person hadn't actually thought about what they were saying? That's workslop. And in 2025, it's an epidemic.

The term is a portmanteau of "work" plus "slop"—coined by researchers studying AI's productivity impact. It captures the low-quality, mass-produced feel of lazy AI outputs.

Example email: "Dear Team, I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the deliverables we discussed in our last meeting. It is important that we align on expectations and ensure all stakeholders are informed of the strategic priorities moving forward. Please advise on your availability for a follow-up discussion. Best regards."

What's wrong with this email? No specific information, no clear ask, no evidence of actual thinking—just AI-generated filler. When you submit a workslop cover letter, employers NOTICE. When you send workslop emails during internship, colleagues NOTICE. Your professional reputation is at stake from day one.
    </speaker-notes>

  <slide number="11" layout="content" title="The Workslop Statistics">
    <content>
## The Hidden Cost of Workslop

**Impact on Recipients:**
- 41% of workers have encountered workslop
- ~2 hours of rework per workslop incident
- 53% felt annoyed by workslop
- 22% felt offended by receiving it
- 50% view the sender as less capable

**Organizational Costs:**
- $186/month invisible productivity tax per worker
- 95% of AI projects fail to show ROI (MIT Media Lab)

**Career Impact:**
- 1 in 10 job seekers denied positions when AI use discovered
- Workslop damages professional relationships long-term

**Source:** Niederhoffer et al. (2025), HBR
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
These aren't hypothetical risks. This is data from 2025 workplace studies. Let's walk through each statistic:

41% encounter rate: Almost half of professionals are dealing with workslop regularly. Your future colleagues are already frustrated by this. Standing out by NOT producing workslop is a competitive advantage.

2 hours of rework: When you send workslop to a manager or colleague, THEY have to spend time clarifying what you actually meant. You're not saving time—you're transferring work to others. This damages your reputation fast.

53% annoyed, 22% offended: People feel disrespected when they receive obvious AI slop. It signals "I didn't care enough to think about this." Especially damaging in Vietnamese context where respect and effort are highly valued.

50% view sender as less capable: This is the career killer. Using AI poorly makes people think you CAN'T think critically. Employers ask: "If they can't judge when AI output is good, can they make ANY business judgment?"

1 in 10 job seekers rejected: Recruiting teams are now trained to spot AI-generated applications. Not because they oppose AI use—because they oppose LAZY use. Your competition isn't students who don't use AI; it's students who use it WELL.

Imagine spending hours on an application, only to be auto-rejected because AI detector flagged your cover letter. Or worse: getting the interview, then being asked about something in your cover letter you didn't actually write.

  <slide number="12" layout="framework" title="Pilot vs. Passenger">
    <content>
## Two Mindsets, Two Outcomes

**PASSENGERS:**
- Lean on AI to avoid hard work
- Copy-paste AI output without editing
- Produce content that "looks polished but rings hollow"
- Treat AI as a shortcut, not a tool
- **Result:** Workslop that damages reputation

**PILOTS:**
- Actively steer AI with judgment
- Use AI as springboard for insight, not replacement for thinking
- Frame problems strategically before asking AI
- Edit and refine outputs critically
- **Result:** Enhanced work that showcases both AI capability and human judgment

**The Question:**
Are you in control, or are you along for the ride?
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
This metaphor from the HBR research is perfect. When you're in a plane, who do you want flying it? Same question for your career: Are you the pilot or the passenger?

Passenger behaviors (what NOT to do): Open ChatGPT, say "Write me a cover letter for this job," copy entire output, submit. No strategic thinking about what makes YOU a good fit. No judgment about whether AI's framing is appropriate. No editing to ensure the voice sounds authentically yours. Essentially: outsourcing thinking to AI.

Pilot behaviors (what TO do): BEFORE asking AI: "What are the 3 most important things this employer needs to know about me?" Frame the task: "I need help articulating how my data analytics project demonstrates problem-solving skills." Review AI output critically: "This paragraph is too generic—I need a specific example." Edit extensively: AI provides raw material, YOU craft the final product. Essentially: Using AI to enhance your thinking, not replace it.

Critical distinction: Passengers treat AI as autopilot. Pilots treat AI as co-pilot—AI provides options, YOU make decisions.

Self-reflection: Think about the last time you used AI for schoolwork. Be honest: Were you a pilot or passenger? If you were a passenger, what would piloting have looked like?

In Vietnamese professional culture, thorough preparation and attention to detail are respected. Submitting workslop is like showing up to a meeting unprepared—it signals disrespect. Being a "pilot" aligns with cultural values of diligence and care.

  <slide number="14" layout="content" title="Beyond Human in the Loop">
    <content>
## The Judgment Imperative

**2024: "Human in the Loop"**
- Humans monitor AI outputs
- Humans provide oversight
- Passive role: approval or rejection

**2025: "Human at the Helm"**
- Humans make strategic decisions AI can't
- Humans exercise judgment in ambiguous situations
- Active role: direction and discernment

> "I don't think that we are thoughtfully enough educating people about how to be good at judgment. That's a step that we will have to take as a civilization, honestly, in the next three to five years."
> — **Aashna Kircher**, VP of People Analytics, Workday (October 2025)
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
In 2024, executives talked about keeping "humans in the loop"—meaning someone checks AI's work. By 2025, executives realized that's not enough. The limitation of "human in the loop" is that it implies humans are just quality checkers—reactive, not proactive. It doesn't capture where humans add UNIQUE value.

The evolution to "human at the helm" recognizes humans make decisions AI cannot. It's about proactive strategic thinking. Judgment as the core differentiator.

What IS judgment? The ability to make sound decisions when there's no clear "right" answer. Weighing tradeoffs, considering context, evaluating risks. Synthesizing data WITH values, ethics, stakeholder needs. This cannot be automated—it's inherently human.

Workday executive quote analysis: Major HR tech company executive saying this publicly signals importance. "Not thoughtfully enough educating people" equals gap in education systems. "A step we will have to take as a civilization" equals fundamental shift needed. You're ahead of the curve by developing this skill NOW.

## The Skills Hiring Managers Seek (2025)

**Microsoft's Katy George (Former McKinsey Partner):**

Employees who thrive demonstrate:
1. **Sound judgment**
2. **Effective delegation to AI agents**
3. **Quality control over AI outputs**
4. **Design-thinking mindset**

**NACE Employer Survey (2025):**

Top competencies employers seek:
1. Communication
2. Critical thinking
3. ...both developed by using AI as thought partner, not answer generator

**The Pattern:** Human skills are now premium skills
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
This is data from October 2025—what employers are ACTUALLY hiring for right now. Katy George is a former McKinsey partner, now at Microsoft leading people strategy. These aren't soft preferences; these are hiring criteria. Notice: "Sound judgment" is number one, before any technical skills.

Breaking down the four skills:

Sound judgment: Can you make good decisions when AI gives you three options? Can you identify when AI is confidently wrong? Can you weigh business tradeoffs AI doesn't understand?

Effective delegation to AI: Knowing WHAT to ask AI to do vs. what YOU should do. This is exactly what context engineering enables. Pilots delegate well; passengers don't delegate—they abdicate.

Quality control over AI outputs: The workslop detector skill. Can you tell when AI output is good enough vs. needs refinement? Your 30-second test: Would you bet your professional reputation on this output?

Design-thinking mindset: Iterative problem-solving. Not expecting perfect first drafts from AI. Comfortable with experimentation and refinement.

NACE Survey: National Association of Colleges and Employers—the authoritative source on what employers want. Communication and critical thinking have been top skills for years. What changed in 2025: How you DEVELOP these skills (using AI as thought partner).

Key insight for students: The more AI can do routine work, the MORE valuable human skills become. You're not competing with AI; you're competing with other humans who use AI well. Developing judgment NOW gives you 3-5 year career advantage.

  <slide number="16" layout="content" title="The Chief Experimentation Officer">
    <content>
## Cultivating Experimental Mindset

**The Shift:**
From "What's the right way to use AI?"
To "How can I experiment and learn what works?"

**Why This Matters:**
- AI tools evolve every month
- No one has "figured out" the perfect approach
- Continuous experimentation is the only sustainable strategy

**Your Role:**
- Test different approaches with AI
- Reflect on what produces quality vs. workslop
- Iterate based on feedback
- Build judgment through repeated practice

**Application to Career Development:**
- Experiment with AI for resume optimization
- Test different approaches to cover letter framing
- Learn from what resonates vs. what falls flat
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Microsoft executive quoted in the Fortune article said: "Every manager must be a Chief Experimentation Officer." That applies to you as you develop your career skills.

The experimentation mindset: You won't get AI use right on first try—that's okay. The goal is continuous improvement through testing and learning. This is exactly what your Mentorship Program enables (safe space to experiment with professional feedback).

Practical examples:

Experiment 1—CV bullet points: Try 3 approaches with AI. Approach A: "Make this bullet point more professional." Approach B: "Reframe this experience to highlight analytical skills." Approach C: "This bullet is about a data project. The job values 'data-driven decision making.' Help me connect these." Which produces the best result? You're building judgment.

Experiment 2—Cover letter tone: Draft 1: Formal, traditional Vietnamese business style. Draft 2: Western confident, achievement-focused style. Draft 3: Hybrid—respectful but demonstrating initiative. Get feedback from mentor on which resonates for target company culture.

The learning cycle: Form hypothesis about what will work, test with AI assistance, evaluate quality of output, reflect on what made the difference, apply learning to next iteration.

Connection to assessment: Your Mentorship Program reflections should document these experiments. Your Personal Development Plan should show evidence of iterative improvement. You're not graded on getting it perfect first time—you're graded on demonstrating learning.

Avoiding perfectionism: Students often freeze waiting for the "right" answer. Experimentation mindset equals permission to try, fail, learn. Every "failed" experiment builds judgment.

# Part 4: Practical Framework
## AI-Assisted Career Development
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Everything we've covered—context engineering, avoiding workslop, exercising judgment—comes together in this framework. Developed by career services professionals specifically for students like you. This is where theory meets practice.

## The Career Preparation Framework

**EXPLORE:** Map possibilities and surface gaps
**BUILD:** Learn through iterative practice
**CONNECT:** Communicate and network with purpose
**REFINE:** Test, adapt, and verify

**Source:** Chremos & Repetto (2025), Inside Higher Ed

**Key Principle:** AI as thought partner, not answer generator

**Result:** Career materials that reflect authentic YOU, enhanced by AI capability
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
This framework comes from university career services directors—people who place hundreds of students in jobs every year. They've seen what works and what doesn't in 2025.

Overview: Four sequential stages, each with specific AI use cases. Not linear—you'll loop back as you develop. Aligns perfectly with your Mentorship Program and Personal Development Plan.

Why four stages? EXPLORE equals self-awareness (what possibilities exist?). BUILD equals skill development (how do I prepare?). CONNECT equals relationship building (who can help?). REFINE equals quality control (is this good enough?).

Framework philosophy: AI helps you think through each stage. YOU make the strategic decisions. Combines AI efficiency with human judgment.

Preview: Next four slides break down each stage with specific activities. Pay attention to which stage you're currently weakest in. Tutorial will have you practice activities from YOUR gap area.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="19" layout="content" title="Stage 1: EXPLORE">
    <content>
## EXPLORE: Map Possibilities & Surface Gaps

**Objective:** Use AI to expand your awareness of career options and identify skill gaps

**AI-Assisted Activities:**
1. Infer competencies from your coursework and projects
2. Compare your skills against current job postings in target industries
3. Generate scholarship/fellowship opportunity matrices
4. Describe communication norms in different workplace settings

**Example Prompts:**
- "I've completed courses in microeconomics, data analytics, and business communication. I led a team project analyzing consumer behavior. What competencies could I claim based on these experiences?"
- "I'm interested in management consulting in Vietnam. What skills do top firms like McKinsey, BCG, and Bain prioritize in job postings?"

**Pilot Behavior:** You curate which experiences to highlight; AI helps you see patterns
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
The EXPLORE stage is about expanding your mental map. Most students underestimate their own competencies—AI can help surface what you've actually developed.

Activity 1—Infer competencies: Problem students face: "I don't have any real experience." Reality: You have academic projects, volunteer work, club leadership. AI can help translate academic experiences into professional competencies. Example: Group presentation translates to project management, stakeholder communication, deadline management.

Activity 2—Compare against job postings: Collect 5-10 job descriptions for roles you want in 3 years. Ask AI to identify common requirements. AI reveals patterns: "8 out of 10 postings require 'stakeholder management.'" Now you know what to develop.

Activity 3—Scholarship opportunities: Vietnam students have access to ASEAN scholarships, corporate programs, government initiatives. AI can help organize research into structured comparison. You make the final decision on which to pursue.

Activity 4—Workplace communication norms: Vietnamese vs. multinational company cultures. Consulting vs. corporate vs. startup communication styles. AI provides research synthesis; you adapt based on your fit.

Common mistake: Students ask AI "What career should I pursue?" That's a PASSENGER question (asking AI to decide for you). PILOT question: "Given my interest in sustainability and my data analysis skills, what industries are actively hiring for roles that combine both?"

Connection to assessment: Mentorship Meeting 1 prep—use EXPLORE activities to identify discussion topics. Personal Development Plan—EXPLORE findings inform your SWOT analysis.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="20" layout="content" title="Stage 2: BUILD">
    <content>
## BUILD: Learn Through Iterative Practice

**Objective:** Use AI to practice professional tasks and build competence through experimentation

**AI-Assisted Activities:**
1. Experiment with different CV architectures (chronological vs. skills-based)
2. Generate individual development plans
3. Create mock interview questions specific to target companies
4. Overcome "blank-page intimidation" in application writing

**Example Prompts:**
- "I'm applying to VinGroup's management trainee program. Generate 10 behavioral interview questions they might ask, focusing on leadership, innovation, and cultural fit."
- "Here's a bullet point from my CV: 'Led team project on consumer behavior analysis.' Reframe this three different ways emphasizing: (1) leadership, (2) analytical skills, (3) business impact."

**Pilot Behavior:** You set learning goals; AI provides practice environments
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
BUILD is where most students should spend time this semester. You're building a toolkit of career materials and practiced responses.

Activity 1—CV architecture: Traditional chronological CV vs. skills-based CV vs. hybrid. AI can generate each version from the same raw experiences. YOU decide which format best positions you for target roles. Experimentation helps you understand tradeoffs.

Activity 2—Individual development plans: Based on EXPLORE findings, you identified skill gaps. AI can help structure: "To develop stakeholder management skills, what activities could a second-year business student pursue?" AI suggests options; you evaluate feasibility and alignment with interests.

Activity 3—Mock interview questions: Research shows practiced candidates perform 40% better in interviews. AI can generate realistic questions based on company and role. Practice answering out loud, refine responses, practice again. This is perfect use of AI—unlimited practice without imposing on busy professionals.

Activity 4—Blank-page intimidation: Starting a cover letter is hard—where do you begin? AI can generate a mediocre first draft to react against. Often easier to edit than create from scratch. Critical: You must HEAVILY edit AI's draft to sound like you.

The iteration principle: Don't expect AI's first output to be final. Generate, evaluate, refine, repeat. Each iteration builds your judgment about what "good" looks like.

Time management: BUILD activities can consume unlimited time. Set boundaries: "I'll test 3 CV formats, not 20." Minimum effective dose applies here too.

Connection to assessment: Mentorship Meeting 2—bring draft CV for mentor review (AI-assisted but human-refined). Personal Development Plan—include evidence of skill-building activities.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="21" layout="content" title="Stage 3: CONNECT">
    <content>
## CONNECT: Communicate & Network with Purpose

**Objective:** Use AI to prepare for high-quality professional interactions

**AI-Assisted Activities:**
1. Rehearse tailored 60-second elevator pitches with AI roleplaying different audiences
2. Simulate informational interviews with AI asking follow-up questions
3. Draft initial outreach messages to potential mentors for personalization
4. Explore networking strategies appropriate to professional contexts

**Example Prompts:**
- "Roleplay an informational interview. You are a senior manager at Masan Group. I'm a second-year student interested in FMCG marketing. Ask me questions about my background and career interests, then provide feedback on my responses."
- "I want to reach out to an NEU alumna working at Deloitte for an informational interview. Draft an outreach email I can personalize."

**Pilot Behavior:** You build genuine relationships; AI helps you prepare and practice
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Networking makes many students uncomfortable—especially if you're more introverted. AI can help you practice in a low-stakes environment.

Activity 1—Elevator pitch practice: 60-second introduction is essential skill. But your pitch should ADAPT to audience. Pitch to recruiter at career fair is not equal to pitch to professor for research opportunity. AI can roleplay different audiences. Practice until you're comfortable with core message and adaptations.

Activity 2—Informational interview simulation: Before your real Mentorship Program meetings, practice with AI. AI asks questions, you respond, AI provides feedback. Builds confidence so you're not stumbling through actual mentor meetings. Helps you refine what questions to ask.

Activity 3—Outreach message drafting: Cold outreach is intimidating. AI can draft template: "Hi [Name], I'm a second-year BBAE student interested in [field]. I came across your profile and was impressed by [specific detail]. Would you be open to a brief informational interview?" Critical: You MUST personalize—research the person, mention specific details. Workslop outreach gets ignored; personalized outreach gets responses.

Activity 4—Networking strategy research: Different industries have different networking norms. Banking: Formal, hierarchical, careful language. Tech startups: Informal, direct, demo your skills. AI can help you research expectations so you don't make cultural mistakes.

Vietnamese context: Relationship-building in Vietnam often requires patience and multiple touchpoints. Respect for hierarchy and proper introductions matter. AI can help you understand norms, but YOU must demonstrate genuine respect and interest.

Connection to assessment: Your entire Mentorship Program IS the CONNECT stage. Preparation forms before meetings equal using AI to prepare thoughtful questions. Reflection forms after meetings equal documenting what you learned.

Warning: NEVER send AI-generated messages without heavy personalization. Recipients can tell when outreach is templated. Workslop networking destroys opportunities.

    <content>
## REFINE: Test, Adapt, and Verify

**Objective:** Apply critical quality control to AI-assisted work before it represents you

**AI-Assisted Activities:**
1. Simulate reviewer critiques of application materials
2. A/B test AI-generated narrative approaches with trusted advisors
3. Identify jargon and unclear transitions before interviews
4. **CRITICAL:** Verify all references, deadlines, and claims against primary sources

**Example Prompts:**
- "Review this cover letter as a hiring manager would. What weaknesses or red flags would you identify?"
- "This CV bullet claims I 'increased efficiency by 30%.' What evidence would a skeptical interviewer ask for? How should I prepare?"

**The 30-Second Test:**
Before submitting any AI-assisted work: Would a colleague recognize this as thoughtful human work or AI-generated filler?

**Pilot Behavior:** You maintain quality standards; AI helps you pressure-test work
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
REFINE is where workslop gets caught—or not. This stage separates pilots from passengers.

Activity 1—Simulate reviewer critique: Ask AI to tear apart your cover letter. AI identifies: generic phrases, unsupported claims, weak transitions. Better to catch issues yourself than have employer catch them. This develops your own critical eye over time.

Activity 2—A/B testing narratives: You've drafted a Personal Development Plan vision statement. Create two versions with AI assistance. Share both with mentor, asking which resonates more professionally. Humans make final call; AI generates options.

Activity 3—Jargon detection: Students often use business jargon without understanding it. "Synergy," "leverage," "strategic alignment"—do you know what these MEAN? AI can identify jargon in your writing. Then YOU decide: Is this term necessary? Can I say it more simply?

Activity 4—VERIFICATION (Critical): This is where AI fails and you MUST catch it. AI might hallucinate scholarship deadlines, company details, statistics. ALWAYS verify facts against original sources. Example: If AI says "McKinsey's top value is 'client first,'" check McKinsey's actual website. One false claim in application equals instant rejection.

The 30-second test explained: Imagine senior colleague spending 30 seconds on your document. Would they think: "This person thought carefully about this"? Or would they think: "This is AI-generated filler"? Workslop fails the 30-second test.

Real-world example: Student submits cover letter: "I am excited to join [Company Name] because of your commitment to innovation and excellence." 30-second test: Generic, could apply to any company, obvious AI template. Refined version: "I am excited to join Masan Group because your recent launch of the Phuc Long coffee brand demonstrates exactly the kind of consumer-insight-driven innovation I want to learn." 30-second test: Specific, researched, demonstrates genuine interest.

Connection to assessment: Before submitting ANY Mentorship Program document—30-second test. Before final Personal Development Plan submission—REFINE stage activities. Your reflection on how you refined work demonstrates metacognition (LO4).

Final warning: Passengers skip REFINE—they submit AI's first draft. Pilots spend 50% of their time in REFINE. The refinement IS where your value shows.

# Putting It Into Practice
## Your Action Plan
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
We've covered a lot of concepts. Now: what do you DO with this? Let's make this concrete with specific action steps you can take immediately.
    </speaker-notes>
  </slide>

  <slide number="24" layout="content" title="This Week's Actions">
    <content>
## Immediate Action Steps

**Before Tutorial:**
1. Create free accounts: ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini (at least one)
2. Review your current CV (if you have one)
3. Find one job posting for a role you want in 3 years

**During Tutorial:**
1. Practice context engineering with real career materials
2. Complete workslop detection exercise
3. Draft AI-assisted elevator pitch using Explore-Build-Connect-Refine
4. Test your outputs with the 30-second test

**This Week:**
1. Experiment with AI for Mentorship Program prep
2. Document what works vs. produces workslop
3. Bring questions to next lecture
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Before tutorial: Give students specific prep tasks so they arrive ready. Free accounts: All major AI tools offer free tiers sufficient for this course. Having a job posting grounds the practice in reality.

During tutorial: Tutorial is hands-on—they'll actually USE these tools. Tutor notes provide detailed facilitation guidance. Students work in pairs to give each other 30-second test feedback.

This week: The experimentation mindset starts now. Mentorship Program begins this week—perfect timing. Students should arrive at first mentor meeting having practiced with AI.

Setting expectations: You won't master context engineering this week—that's okay. The goal is to START experimenting and building judgment. Every time you use AI for career prep, ask yourself: Am I being a pilot or passenger?

Encouraging questions: AI use raises lots of questions—that's normal. Office hours available if you want to discuss specific scenarios. Your mentor can also provide feedback on AI-assisted materials.

## What You Must Remember

1. **Context engineering** > prompt engineering
   - Curate what AI sees, not just what you tell it

2. **Workslop destroys careers**
   - 1 in 10 job seekers rejected when AI use discovered poorly

3. **Judgment is irreplaceable**
   - "Human at the helm," not just "human in the loop"

4. **Pilot, don't passenger**
   - Actively steer AI; don't abdicate thinking

5. **Explore-Build-Connect-Refine**
   - Your framework for AI-assisted career development

6. **The 30-Second Test**
   - Before submitting: Does this reflect thoughtful human work?
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
If you remember only six things from today, remember these.

Context engineering: The skill that didn't exist in 2023 but is essential in 2025. Goldilocks zone, minimum effective dose, attention budget. Practice this weekly.

Workslop destroys careers: Statistics were shocking—41% encounter it, 50% judge senders as less capable. You cannot afford to be in that 50%.

Judgment is irreplaceable: Executives explicitly saying this is what they hire for. AI can process data; YOU make decisions.

Pilot vs. passenger: The mental model for every AI interaction. Ask yourself constantly: Am I in control?

Four-stage framework: Practical tool you can use TODAY. Aligns with mentorship and PDP. Not theoretical—actionable.

The 30-second test: Your quality control mechanism. Catches workslop before it damages your reputation.

Final encouragement: The fact that you're learning these skills in second year puts you years ahead of most professionals. Your competition isn't AI—it's other humans who don't understand how to work with AI effectively. You now have the frameworks. Tutorial is where you build the skills.

## Open Discussion

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What concerns you most about using AI for career preparation?
2. Can you think of a time you received "workslop" from someone?
3. Where do you think your biggest gap is: Explore, Build, Connect, or Refine?

**Office Hours:** By appointment – email wil.hoang@gmail.com

**Next Week:** Reflection & Reflective Learning
- Gibbs' Cycle, Kolb's Cycle, reflective writing for your essay
    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
Give students 2 minutes to discuss prompts with neighbor, then open to whole class.

Likely student concerns:

"How do I know if I'm using too much AI?" Answer: The 30-second test. If output doesn't sound authentically like you, you've used it poorly.

"What if my mentor can tell I used AI?" Answer: Your mentor EXPECTS you to use AI. Question is whether you used it well (pilot) or poorly (passenger).

"I'm worried about academic integrity violations." Answer: This course explicitly teaches appropriate AI use. Key: AI assists YOUR thinking; it doesn't replace it. Always cite if using AI-generated ideas verbatim.

Some students won't ask publicly. Mention office hours. Encourage questions in tutorial when practicing.

Preview Week 3: Reflection is how you learn from experiences. Gibbs, Kolb, Driscoll frameworks structure deep thinking. These frameworks ALSO benefit from AI assistance (sensing a theme?).

Ending: See you in tutorial—bring your laptop and readiness to experiment. Remember: Every expert was once a beginner who kept practicing.

    </content>
    <speaker-notes>
All four readings are open access—no paywalls. Readings directly support tutorial activities. Students who read will get much more from hands-on practice.

Reading strategy: Don't just skim—take notes on specific techniques you want to try. Anthropic article is most technical but has practical frameworks. HBR article has the statistics and workslop concept. Fortune article has executive quotes showing what employers want. Inside Higher Ed has the most directly actionable career advice.

Discussion preparation: Next lecture will reference these readings. Tutorial assumes familiarity. If tight on time: prioritize HBR (workslop) and Inside Higher Ed (framework).

Final note: Yes, you can use AI to help you understand these readings. But apply the pilot mindset: AI can summarize, but YOU need to identify which techniques apply to YOUR career situation.
