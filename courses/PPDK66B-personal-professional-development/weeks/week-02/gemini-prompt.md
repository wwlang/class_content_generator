### Slide 6 (Layout: Section Divider)
**Content:**
Part 1

**Main Text:** Context Engineering: The Premium Skill Replacing Prompt Engineering

**Design Notes:** Full-bleed section break with strong typography and subtle tech-themed visual

---

### Slide 7 (Layout: Comparison - Two Column)
**Title:** What Is Context Engineering?

**Left Column - Old Paradigm: Prompt Engineering (2023-2024)**
- Writing clever instructions for AI
- Focus: "How do I phrase this request?"
- Skill: Crafting the perfect command

**Right Column - New Paradigm: Context Engineering (2025+)**
- Curating what AI "sees" before it responds
- Focus: "What information does AI need?"
- Skill: Strategic information selection

**Bottom Section:**
**Why the Shift?**
Modern AI models (like Claude 3.7, GPT-4.5, Gemini 2.0) can follow instructions brilliantly—but they need the RIGHT CONTEXT to produce valuable work.

**Quote:** "Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information." — Andrej Karpathy, Former Director of AI, Tesla (June 2025)

---

### Slide 8 (Layout: Framework/Diagram)
**Title:** Framework 1: The Goldilocks Zone

**Content:**
Finding the Optimal "Altitude" for Your Instructions

**Visual Diagram showing three levels:**

**TOO RIGID (Brittle)**
"Use exactly 3 bullet points, 12 words each, starting with action verbs..."
↓
❌ Breaks when situation requires flexibility

**GOLDILOCKS ZONE (Just Right)**
"Summarize key points clearly, using bullet points where appropriate..."
↓
✓ AI adapts to context while following intent

**TOO VAGUE (Unpredictable)**
"Make it good..."
↓
❌ AI must guess what you want

**Bottom:** The Principle: Instructions should guide behavior without over-specifying format.

**Design Notes:** Use color coding (red for bad, green for good) and arrows showing flow

---

### Slide 9 (Layout: Framework with Visual)
**Title:** Framework 2: Minimum Effective Dose

**Content:**
**Less Information, Better Results**

**The Principle:**
"Find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of some desired outcome."

**Why This Matters:**
- More information ≠ Better outputs
- Strategic selection beats comprehensive data dumps
- Forces YOU to think critically about what matters

**Career Application Example:**
❌ **Bad:** Paste entire job description + your full CV → "Write cover letter"
✓ **Good:** Identify 3 key job requirements + your 2 most relevant experiences → "Connect these qualifications to these requirements"

**Discussion:** Why would MORE information sometimes produce WORSE results?

**Visual:** Icon or graphic representing signal vs. noise, or essential vs. excessive information

---

### Slide 10 (Layout: Framework with Metaphor)
**Title:** Framework 3: The Attention Budget

**Content:**
**Context as a Finite, Precious Resource**

**The Metaphor:**
AI's attention is like a spotlight—it illuminates everything in its beam, but the larger the area, the dimmer the light on any single object.

**Technical Reality:**
- Large Language Models have context windows (e.g., 200,000 tokens)
- But attention "stretches thin" across large contexts
- Important details can get lost in information overload

**Strategic Implication:**
Treat AI's context window like your bank account—spend carefully on high-value information.

**Mini-Activity:** Look at your phone's most recent message to someone. If you had to cut 50% of the words while keeping the meaning, which words would you keep? That's attention budget thinking.

**Visual:** Spotlight or budget/resource allocation imagery

---

### Slide 11 (Layout: Side-by-Side Comparison)
**Title:** Context Engineering in Action: CV Writing

**Scenario:** You're applying for a marketing analyst role. The job emphasizes "data-driven storytelling."

**Left Column - Passenger Approach (Weak Context Engineering):**
```
"Here's my CV. Improve it."
[Pastes entire CV with 8 years of unrelated experience]
```
**Result:** Generic improvements, no strategic focus

**Right Column - Pilot Approach (Strong Context Engineering):**
```
Context: "This role requires data-driven storytelling. Here are 3 projects where I translated data insights into compelling narratives: [specific examples]. The job description emphasizes Tableau skills and A/B testing experience."

Request: "Help me reorganize my CV to lead with data storytelling skills, emphasizing these 3 projects. Suggest metrics to quantify impact."
```
**Result:** Strategically tailored CV highlighting relevant strengths

**Design Notes:** Use contrasting visual treatment to emphasize difference

---

### Slide 12 (Layout: Quote Slide)
**Content:**
"People associate prompts with short task descriptions... When in every industrial-strength LLM app, context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information."

**Attribution:** — Andrej Karpathy, Former Director of AI, Tesla (June 2025)

**Design Notes:** Large, impactful quote treatment with attribution clearly visible

---

### Slide 13 (Layout: Key Takeaways)
**Title:** Key Takeaway: Context Engineering

**Content:**
**What You Should Remember:**

1. Context engineering is about **curating** what AI sees, not just what you tell it to do
2. Three core principles:
   - **Goldilocks Zone**: Not too rigid, not too vague
   - **Minimum Effective Dose**: Strategic selection over information dumps
   - **Attention Budget**: Context is finite and precious
3. This skill separates **pilots** (strategic users) from **passengers** (passive users)
4. Immediate application: Every time you use AI, ask yourself: "What context would help AI give me the best possible response?"

**In tutorial:** You'll practice context engineering on your own career materials.

**Title:** The Judgment Crisis: What Executives Are Saying

**Content:**
**Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, October 2025**

**Aashna Kircher (Workday, Chief Innovation Officer):**
"I don't think we are thoughtfully enough educating people about how to be good at judgment. That's a step we will have to take as a civilization, honestly, in the next three to five years."

**Katy George (Microsoft, Chief People Officer):**
Employees who thrive will demonstrate:
- Sound judgment in ambiguous situations
- Ability to delegate effectively to AI agents
- Quality control over AI outputs
- Design-thinking mindset for complex problems

**The Urgent Question:** If AI can analyze data and generate recommendations instantly, what does HUMAN judgment actually mean?

**Visual:** Professional headshots or representative executive imagery

---

### Slide 16 (Layout: Progression/Levels)
**Title:** Beyond Human in the Loop: The Three Levels

**Content:**

**Level 1: Human in the Loop (2023-2024 Standard)**
- AI generates outputs
- Human reviews and approves
- Good enough for routine tasks

**Level 2: Human at the Helm (Current Expectation)**
- Human sets strategic direction BEFORE AI involvement
- AI executes tactical work
- Human evaluates alignment with strategic intent

**Level 3: Judgment Integration (Premium Skill)**
- Human brings domain expertise, contextual awareness, ethical reasoning
- AI brings data processing, pattern recognition, speed
- Synthesis creates insights neither could achieve alone

**Discussion:** Think of a recent decision you made. How would AI have approached it differently? What human factors did you consider that AI couldn't?

**Design Notes:** Show as ascending levels or progression pathway

---

### Slide 17 (Layout: Framework - Two Column Comparison)
**Title:** Framework 4: The Pilot vs. Passenger Mindset

**Content:**
**Two Ways to Work with AI**

**Left Column - PASSENGER MINDSET:**
- Leans on AI to avoid hard thinking
- Treats AI as answer generator
- Produces outputs that "look polished but ring hollow"
- Abdicates responsibility for quality
- **Result:** Work lacks authenticity and strategic insight

**Right Column - PILOT MINDSET:**
- Uses AI as thought partner, not answer machine
- Actively steers AI with judgment and framing
- Treats AI outputs as starting points for refinement
- Takes responsibility for final deliverable quality
- **Result:** Work demonstrates human judgment augmented by AI capability

**Critical Question:** When you last used AI for an assignment, were you a pilot or a passenger?

**Design Notes:** Use contrasting visuals (airplane pilot vs. passenger imagery)

---

### Slide 18 (Layout: Case Study)
**Title:** Judgment in Action: The Case Method

**Content:**
**Scenario:** Your company is considering whether to expand into a new market. AI provides:
- Market size projections
- Competitor analysis
- Risk assessment scores
- Financial modeling

**Questions Only Human Judgment Can Answer:**
1. Does this align with our company's **values** and long-term **vision**?
2. What **relationships** and **cultural dynamics** might affect success?
3. Is the **timing** right given current organizational capacity?
4. What **unintended consequences** might emerge that data doesn't reveal?
5. Would I feel proud explaining this decision to our stakeholders in 5 years?

**Key Insight:** AI can process infinite data. Humans must decide what matters and why.

**Visual:** Business scenario illustration or decision-making imagery

---

### Slide 19 (Layout: Content with Icon)
**Title:** Developing Judgment: The Chief Experimentation Officer Mindset

**Content:**
**Katy George (Microsoft):** Every manager must become a "Chief Experimentation Officer"

**What This Means:**
- **Continuous experimentation:** Test AI tools, iterate, adapt
- **Comfort with ambiguity:** No fixed playbook for AI integration
- **Learning from failure:** Not every AI experiment succeeds
- **Systematic reflection:** What worked? What didn't? Why?

**How to Start NOW:**
1. **Try → Reflect → Adjust:** Use AI for a task, evaluate the result, change your approach
2. **Compare:** Do the same task with and without AI. What differences do you notice?
3. **Track:** Keep a log of AI successes and failures. Patterns will emerge.
4. **Discuss:** Talk with peers about their AI experiences. Learn from diverse approaches.

**Visual:** Experimentation/laboratory theme or continuous improvement cycle

---

### Slide 20 (Layout: Key Takeaways)
**Title:** Key Takeaway: Human Judgment

**Content:**
**What You Should Remember:**

1. **"Human in the loop" is insufficient**—you must be "human at the helm" demonstrating judgment
2. **Pilot vs. Passenger mindset** determines career outcomes:
   - Pilots use AI as thought partner
   - Passengers use AI as answer generator
3. **Judgment addresses questions AI cannot:**
   - Strategic alignment, ethical implications, cultural context, relationship dynamics
4. **Develop the "Chief Experimentation Officer" mindset:**
   - Continuous testing, systematic reflection, learning from failure

**Immediate Action:** Next time you use AI, pause before accepting its output. Ask: "Does this reflect MY judgment and strategic thinking, or am I just accepting what AI produced?"

**Visual:** Summary checklist or key points visual

### Slide 21 (Layout: Section Divider)
**Content:**
Part 3

**Main Text:** The Hidden Risk: AI-Generated "Workslop" and Professional Reputation

**Design Notes:** Full-bleed section break with warning/alert aesthetic

---

### Slide 22 (Layout: Content with Statistics)
**Title:** What Is Workslop?

**Content:**
**Definition (Stanford + BetterUp Labs, September 2025):**
AI-generated content that appears polished but lacks substantive insights, strategic thinking, or authentic human judgment.

**You've Experienced Workslop If:**
- You opened a document that looked professional but left you confused about the main point
- You read an email that used many words to say very little
- You received a report with impressive formatting but no actionable recommendations

**The Hidden Epidemic:**
- **41% of workers** have encountered workslop from colleagues
- **53% felt annoyed** when they received workslop
- **22% felt offended** that someone wasted their time
- **50% view workslop senders as less capable professionals**

**Visual:** Statistics displayed as infographic elements

---

### Slide 23 (Layout: Content with Diagram)
**Title:** The Productivity Paradox: Why AI Often Increases Workload

**Content:**
**The Promise vs. The Reality**

**The Promise:** AI will save time and boost productivity

**The Reality (2025 Data):**
- **95% of AI projects** fail to show positive ROI (MIT Media Lab)
- **~2 hours of rework** per workslop incident
- **$186/month** invisible productivity tax per worker who regularly receives workslop
- Workers spend time deciphering, questioning, and correcting AI-generated content

**Why This Happens:**
When people use AI as a shortcut rather than a thought partner, they create work that looks complete but requires extensive rework by others.

**The Asana Paradox (2025):** 90% of highly productive workers report AI creates MORE coordination work initially.

**Visual:** Paradox or cycle diagram showing increased workload

---

### Slide 24 (Layout: Framework Checklist)
**Title:** Framework 5: The 30-Second Test

**Content:**
**Before Submitting ANY AI-Assisted Work, Ask:**

"Would a colleague reviewing this for 30 seconds recognize it as thoughtful human work or AI-generated filler?"

**Red Flags That Indicate Workslop:**
1. **Generic phrasing**: "It's important to note that...", "In today's fast-paced business environment..."
2. **Lack of specifics**: Broad statements without concrete examples or data
3. **No clear argument**: Points are listed but not connected to a strategic conclusion
4. **Missing context**: Assumes reader has background knowledge they may not have
5. **Surface-level analysis**: Identifies obvious points without deeper insight

**Green Flags That Indicate Thoughtful Work:**
1. **Specific examples** tied to YOUR context
2. **Clear strategic recommendation** with reasoning
3. **Acknowledgment of tradeoffs** and alternative perspectives
4. **Evidence of domain knowledge** that AI couldn't have without your input

**Design Notes:** Use red/green color coding for flags

---

### Slide 25 (Layout: Content with Warning)
**Title:** Workslop in Job Applications: The Career Risk

**Content:**
**Sobering Statistics from 2025 Research:**

- **1 in 10 job seekers** were denied positions when employers discovered AI use in application materials
- Recruiters can increasingly detect AI-generated cover letters
- Employers are developing "authenticity screening" processes

**What Went Wrong:**
- Generic cover letters that could apply to any company
- CVs restructured by AI without strategic personalization
- Interview answers that sound rehearsed and lack genuine reflection

**The Paradox:**
- AI can help you prepare application materials
- But AI-generated materials that lack YOUR authentic voice and judgment will get rejected

**Solution:** Use AI as thought partner (pilot) not answer generator (passenger)

**Visual:** Warning or alert icon with job search imagery

---

### Slide 26 (Layout: Quote Slide)
**Content:**
"You might recall the feeling of confusion after opening such a document, followed by frustration. You might have had to spend hours on something that should have taken just one, or found yourself in meetings that could have been avoided."

**Attribution:** — Stanford + BetterUp Labs Research, Harvard Business Review (September 2025)

**Design Notes:** Emotive quote treatment emphasizing frustration/confusion

---

### Slide 27 (Layout: Key Takeaways)
**Title:** Key Takeaway: Avoiding Workslop

**Content:**
**What You Should Remember:**

1. **Workslop is AI-generated content that looks polished but lacks substance**—and it destroys professional credibility
2. **The statistics are damning:**
   - 41% of workers have encountered workslop
   - 50% view workslop creators as less capable
   - 1 in 10 job seekers rejected when AI use detected
3. **Use the 30-Second Test** before submitting any AI-assisted work
4. **AI amplifies your thinking—or reveals its absence**:
   - Pilot mindset → AI helps you articulate strategic insights
   - Passenger mindset → AI generates hollow filler

**Immediate Action:** Review something you created with AI assistance. Does it pass the 30-Second Test? If not, what would you add to demonstrate YOUR judgment?

  - Primary: Professional blues (#2C5F8D, #4A90C7)
  - Secondary: Warm grays (#6B7280, #9CA3AF)
  - Accent: Energizing teal (#14B8A6) for key points
  - Warning/Alert: Muted orange (#F59E0B) for workslop content
  - Success: Fresh green (#10B981) for positive examples
- **Typography:**
  - Headers: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Inter, or PowerPoint's default Calibri)
  - Body: Readable sans-serif with good hierarchy
  - Emphasis: Bold for key terms, italics for quotes
- **Layout Principles:**
  - Generous white space—avoid cluttered slides
  - Clear visual hierarchy (titles, subtitles, body, supporting elements)
  - Consistent alignment and spacing throughout
  - Use of icons/imagery to support (not distract from) content

### Content Treatment
- **Frameworks:** Use diagrams, flowcharts, or visual models—not just bullet points
- **Statistics:** Display as infographics or visual data representations
- **Comparisons:** Use side-by-side layouts or contrasting visual treatments
- **Quotes:** Give prominent, attractive treatment with clear attribution
- **Examples:** Use callout boxes or distinct visual containers

### Images and Graphics
- Use relevant, professional stock photography where specified
- Prefer abstract/conceptual imagery over literal representations
- Include icons to support key concepts
- Ensure all images are high resolution and culturally appropriate for Vietnamese audience
- Avoid clichéd business stock photos (handshakes, people in suits pointing at screens)

### Consistency
- Maintain consistent header/footer treatment across all slides
- Use the same color coding system throughout (red for warnings, green for best practices)
- Apply consistent spacing and alignment
- Ensure slide numbers are visible

## Special Instructions

1. **Slide Transitions:** Use subtle, professional transitions (e.g., Fade, Push)—nothing distracting

2. **Animations:** Minimal animations; if used, should reveal content progressively on complex slides to avoid cognitive overload

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast for text readability
   - Don't rely solely on color to convey meaning
   - Use alt text for images
   - Font size minimum 18pt for body text, 28pt+ for headers

4. **Vietnamese Context:**
   - Examples should reference Vietnamese companies where possible (Viettel, VinGroup, Masan, FPT)
   - Cultural sensitivity in imagery and examples
   - Acknowledge both local and international business norms

5. **Pedagogical Design:**
   - Discussion questions should be visually distinct
   - Mini-activities should be clearly marked
   - Framework slides should use visual models, not just text
   - Key takeaway slides should use visual summaries

## Final Deliverable

Generate a complete PowerPoint file with all 41 slides following the specifications above. The presentation should be:
- Professionally designed and visually cohesive
- Ready for delivery in a 90-minute lecture
- Suitable for Vietnamese undergraduate business students
- Aligned with course learning objectives and assessment requirements
- Printable as handouts if needed (good contrast, readable at smaller sizes)

The presentation should support active learning with clear discussion prompts, reflection questions, and connections to practical applications. Balance visual appeal with content clarity—prioritize student comprehension over decorative elements.
