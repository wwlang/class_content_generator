## Main Activity: AI-Assisted Career Preparation (75 minutes)

### Context

You will use GenAI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or your preferred tool) to prepare three core career materials: CV, cover letter, and elevator pitch. The goal is NOT to have AI generate these for you (passenger mode) but to use AI as a thought partner to develop materials demonstrating YOUR judgment, YOUR experiences, and YOUR authentic professional voice (pilot mode).

### Your Task

Complete all four stages of the Explore-Build-Connect-Refine framework using AI assistance:

---

### Stage 1: EXPLORE (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Select Your Target Role**
Choose a real job posting for a role you might pursue after graduation (or within 2 years of graduation). This could be:
- Marketing analyst
- Business development associate
- Financial analyst
- Management trainee
- Consulting analyst
- Any role aligned with your BBA degree

Find an actual job posting online (LinkedIn, company websites, job boards). Print it or have it open on your device.

**Step 2: Skill Gap Analysis with AI**

Use your GenAI tool with this prompt structure:

```
I'm analyzing a [job title] position at [company]. Here are the key requirements from the job description:

[Paste 3-5 main requirements from the posting]

My background includes:
- BBA major at National Economics University
- Coursework: [list 4-5 relevant courses]
- Experience: [briefly describe any internships, projects, club leadership, part-time work]
- Skills: [list technical and soft skills you've developed]

Based on this information:
1. What competencies have I likely developed that align with this role?
2. Where might I have gaps compared to what the employer seeks?
3. What experiences should I emphasize most strongly in my application?
4. What specific examples from my background could demonstrate [key requirement from job posting]?
```

**Important:** Notice you're providing rich context (your background, specific job requirements) and asking AI to help you ANALYZE, not to make decisions for you.

**Tutor checkpoint:** Tutors will circulate to ensure students are providing adequate context and asking analytical questions (not "write my CV" requests).

---

### Stage 2: BUILD (30 minutes)

**Step 3: CV Restructuring Exercise**

You'll experiment with context engineering to restructure your CV. This is where pilot vs. passenger mindset becomes critical.

**Passenger Approach (DO NOT DO THIS):**
```
❌ "Here's my CV. Make it better."
```

**Pilot Approach (DO THIS):**
```
✓ "I'm applying for [role] at [company]. Based on the job description emphasizing [key requirement], I want to restructure my CV to highlight my most relevant experiences first.

Here are my top 3 experiences demonstrating [key requirement]:
1. [Specific experience with context]
2. [Specific experience with context]
3. [Specific experience with context]

Help me:
1. Craft a professional summary that positions me for this specific role
2. Reorganize my experience section to lead with relevant projects
3. Identify metrics I could add to quantify my impact in each experience
4. Suggest skills section items that align with the job requirements"
```

**Your deliverable:** A restructured CV section (doesn't need to be complete CV, but demonstrate strategic restructuring).

**Apply the 30-Second Test:** Would someone reviewing this for 30 seconds recognize it as thoughtfully tailored to the job, or as generic AI output?

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Generic phrases ("results-oriented professional")
- Vague claims without specifics
- Skills listed without context or examples
- Format that could apply to any job

**Green Flags to Achieve:**
- Specific metrics ("Increased club membership by 40%")
- Clear connection between your experience and job requirements
- Evidence you understand the company/role
- Authentic voice that sounds like you

---

**Step 4: Cover Letter Drafting**

Now apply the Explore-Build-Connect-Refine framework to draft a cover letter opening.

**Context Engineering Exercise:**

First, gather strategic context:
- What does this company value? (Check their website's About/Mission pages)
- Why are YOU genuinely interested in this role? (Be honest)
- What's your most relevant achievement/experience?

Then use this prompt structure:

```
I'm writing a cover letter for [role] at [company]. Here's the strategic context:

Company values/mission: [What you learned from research]
My genuine interest: [Your authentic reason for interest]
Most relevant experience: [Specific achievement/project]
Key requirement to address: [From job posting]

I want to write an opening paragraph that:
1. Immediately shows I understand what the company needs
2. Signals my most relevant qualification
3. Demonstrates genuine interest (not generic)

Help me brainstorm 3 different approaches for the opening paragraph. For each, explain what makes it effective or where it might fall flat.
```

**Your deliverable:** Draft opening paragraph that YOU write (not AI writes for you), informed by AI's brainstorming.

**Critical difference:**
- Passenger: AI writes paragraph → You submit it
- Pilot: AI suggests approaches → You analyze them → You write paragraph incorporating insights

### Stage 3: CONNECT (20 minutes)

**Step 5: Elevator Pitch Practice with AI Roleplay**

Craft a 60-second elevator pitch for a career fair setting. Then use AI to practice delivering it.

**First, draft your pitch covering:**
1. Who you are (name, current status)
2. What you're studying and why it matters
3. What kind of role you're seeking
4. What makes you a strong candidate
5. A question or conversation starter

**Then, use this prompt for roleplay practice:**

```
I'm going to share my 60-second elevator pitch for a career fair. After I share it, roleplay as a [job title you're targeting] from [industry] who is attending the career fair. Ask me 2-3 follow-up questions that a recruiter in this role might ask.

After I answer your questions, provide feedback on:
1. Whether my pitch was clear and memorable
2. How well I handled follow-up questions
3. Where I could strengthen my responses
4. Any jargon or unclear phrasing I should revise

Here's my pitch: [paste your draft]
```

**Your deliverable:**
1. Written elevator pitch
2. Evidence you practiced with AI roleplay (save the conversation)
3. One revision you made based on AI feedback

**Judgment Check:** Does your pitch sound like YOU, or does it sound like an AI-generated professional profile? Test it by reading aloud—does it flow naturally?

---

### Stage 4: REFINE (10 minutes)

**Step 6: Quality Control and Verification**

Apply the 30-Second Test to all three deliverables (CV section, cover letter opening, elevator pitch).

**Use this final prompt:**

```
I'm about to submit application materials for [role]. Please review these materials as if you're a hiring manager looking for reasons to reject my application. Be harsh and direct.

Materials:
[CV section]
[Cover letter opening]
[Elevator pitch]

Identify:
1. Any generic phrasing that suggests AI generation without human judgment
2. Claims I make that lack specific supporting evidence
3. Places where I assume knowledge the reader might not have
4. Jargon or buzzwords that weaken credibility
5. Anything that sounds inauthentic or doesn't match my actual experiences
```

**Then critically:**
- Verify any facts (company information, industry details, skill claims)
- Ensure every achievement you mentioned is something you can actually discuss in an interview
- Check that your materials reflect YOUR voice and judgment

**Your deliverable:** Revised materials with a brief note explaining what you changed after AI critique and why.

### Tutorial Deliverable

By the end of tutorial, you should have (in a shared document or notebook):

1. **Target Job Posting:** Link/description of role you analyzed
2. **Explore Stage Output:** AI-assisted skill gap analysis showing competencies and gaps
3. **Build Stage Output:**
   - Restructured CV section with strategic emphasis
   - Cover letter opening paragraph demonstrating judgment
4. **Connect Stage Output:**
   - 60-second elevator pitch
   - Evidence of AI roleplay practice
5. **Refine Stage Output:**
   - What you changed after AI critique
   - How materials pass 30-Second Test

**Quality Indicator:** Someone reading your materials should be able to tell:
- You used AI assistance (this is transparent and acceptable)
- You demonstrated pilot mindset (strategic direction, judgment, authentic voice)
- You avoided workslop (specific examples, clear reasoning, genuine insight)

## Tutor Note

Circulate throughout Stage 2 (BUILD) especially. Watch for:
- **Passenger mode indicators:** Students asking AI to "write" or "generate" rather than "help me analyze" or "suggest approaches"
- **Poor context engineering:** Vague prompts without specific background information
- **Workslop acceptance:** Students accepting AI outputs without applying judgment or personalizing

**Intervention prompts if you see these issues:**
- "Tell me what context you provided AI before getting this output."
- "Read this aloud to me—does it sound like you?"
- "What judgment call did YOU make here, vs. what AI suggested?"
- "Walk me through: What did AI suggest, and why did you choose this approach over alternatives?"

**Goal:** Students leave tutorial with genuine skill development, not just AI-generated documents.
