## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**
- **Context engineering:** Curating what AI sees (not just what you tell it) using Goldilocks principle, minimum effective dose, and attention budget awareness
- **Workslop:** AI-generated content that looks polished but lacks substance—41% of workers encounter it, 50% judge senders as less capable, 1 in 10 job seekers rejected when discovered
- **Pilot vs. Passenger:** Pilots actively steer AI with judgment; passengers abdicate thinking and produce workslop
- **Explore-Build-Connect-Refine:** Four-stage framework for AI-assisted career development
- **The 30-Second Test:** Would someone recognize your work as thoughtful or AI-generated filler?

**What good work looks like:**
- AI-assisted materials that sound authentically like YOU (not generic templates)
- Evidence of strategic thinking: you set direction, AI enhances execution
- Specific, concrete content (not vague business jargon)
- All facts verified against primary sources

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Mentorship Program rubric—"Quality of Preparation" and "Depth of Reflection" both depend on avoiding workslop and demonstrating judgment in how you use AI tools.

## Activity 1: Context Engineering Practice (25 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Learning to engineer effective context is essential for your Mentorship Program preparation forms. When preparing for mentor meetings, you'll use AI to help draft questions and discussion topics. Poor context = generic questions that waste your mentor's time. Good context = specific, thoughtful questions that demonstrate preparation and earn mentor respect.

**The Challenge:**
You'll write the same CV bullet point THREE ways using different context engineering approaches, then evaluate which produces the best output. This demonstrates why context matters more than prompt phrasing.

### Round 1: The Passenger Approach (5 min)

**Your Task:**
Choose one experience from your background (academic project, volunteer work, club leadership, part-time job). Ask AI to write a CV bullet point using a MINIMAL, vague prompt.

**Example Prompt (Passenger Style):**
```
Write a CV bullet point about my group project.
```

**What to Expect:**
- Generic, templated output
- No specific achievements or context
- Could apply to anyone's group project
- Obvious AI generation

**Your Turn:**
1. Open your AI tool
2. Write a vague, minimal prompt about one of YOUR experiences
3. Copy AI's output to a document
4. Label it "Passenger Approach"

### Round 2: The Goldilocks Approach (10 min)

**Your Task:**
Now provide AI with strategic context using the Goldilocks principle (not too rigid, not too vague, just right).

**Example Prompt (Goldilocks Style):**
```
I need a CV bullet point for a business administration application.

Context:
- Experience: Led a team of 4 students analyzing Vietnamese coffee shop consumer preferences
- Key achievement: Our recommendations helped a local shop increase customer retention by identifying underserved demographic (students seeking quiet study space)
- Skills demonstrated: Data analysis (surveys, Excel), teamwork, business application of research

Tone: Professional but approachable; emphasize both analytical skills and real-world impact
Format: Start with strong action verb, quantify where possible, keep under 25 words
```

**What to Expect:**
- Specific, tailored output
- Incorporates your actual achievements
- Still sounds professional, less obviously AI-generated

**Your Turn:**
1. Rewrite your prompt including:
   - Specific context about your experience
   - Key achievement or outcome
   - Skills you want to highlight
   - Tone and format guidance (the Goldilocks zone)
2. Generate new output
3. Label it "Goldilocks Approach"

### Round 3: Minimum Effective Dose (5 min)

**Your Task:**
Test the minimum effective dose principle. What's the SMALLEST amount of high-quality context that produces excellent results?

**Experiment:**
Remove some context from your Round 2 prompt. What can you cut while still getting good output?

**Example:**
```
CV bullet point for business program application:

Led 4-student team analyzing coffee shop consumer preferences. Result: Identified underserved demographic (students seeking study space), recommendations increased customer retention.

Emphasize: data analysis + business impact. Professional tone, <25 words, action verb start.
```

**Your Turn:**
1. Streamline your Round 2 prompt
2. Test if shorter context still produces quality output
3. Label it "Minimum Dose Approach"

### Pair Evaluation (5 min)

**With Your Partner:**
1. Exchange all three outputs (Passenger, Goldilocks, Minimum Dose)
2. Apply the **30-Second Test** to each:
   - Does this sound like a thoughtful human wrote it?
   - Or does it sound AI-generated?
   - Would you bet your professional reputation on this bullet point?
3. Discuss: Which approach produced the best result? Why?

**Class Discussion:**
- Tutor will ask: "Which approach worked best for most pairs?"
- What did you learn about context engineering?
- Did anyone find Minimum Dose worked as well as Goldilocks?

**Key Takeaway:**
Context engineering isn't about writing longer prompts—it's about providing STRATEGIC information that guides AI to your desired outcome. You're developing judgment about what information matters.

## Activity 2: Workslop Detection Challenge (20 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Your Mentorship Program reflection forms will be evaluated for depth and authenticity. Workslop reflections earn low marks because they lack genuine insight. This activity trains you to recognize the difference between substantive reflection and AI-generated filler—essential for both producing quality work and evaluating your own outputs.

**The Challenge:**
You'll read four cover letter excerpts. Two are workslop (AI-generated with no human refinement). Two are piloted (AI-assisted but human-refined). Can you identify which is which?

### The Four Excerpts

**Excerpt A:**
"I am writing to express my strong interest in the Management Trainee position at VinGroup. Throughout my academic career, I have consistently demonstrated leadership, analytical thinking, and a commitment to excellence. I am particularly drawn to VinGroup's innovative approach to business and its reputation as a leading conglomerate in Vietnam. I am confident that my skills and experiences make me an ideal candidate for this role, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your organization's continued success."

**Excerpt B:**
"When VinGroup launched VinFast's electric vehicles, I spent a weekend at the showroom in Hanoi just to understand the customer experience. I noticed your sales staff emphasized 'Vietnamese innovation' over technical specs—a strategic choice that resonated with national pride. This aligns with my research in my Consumer Behavior course, where I analyzed how local brands compete with multinationals by leveraging cultural values. I want to join VinGroup's Management Trainee program because I'm fascinated by how you balance global business practices with Vietnamese market realities."

**Excerpt C:**
"As a second-year business student at National Economics University, I have developed a strong foundation in business principles, analytical thinking, and teamwork. Through my coursework and extracurricular activities, I have gained valuable experience in project management, data analysis, and cross-functional collaboration. I am eager to apply these skills in a real-world setting and believe that VinGroup's Management Trainee program offers the perfect opportunity for professional growth and development. I am particularly interested in learning from industry leaders and contributing to meaningful projects that drive business impact."

**Excerpt D:**
"My professor once said, 'In Vietnam, relationships are currency.' I tested this during our BBA market research project. Instead of sending email surveys (5% response rate), I spent two weeks at morning coffee shops interviewing small business owners face-to-face (78% response rate, richer qualitative data). This experience taught me that business strategy must adapt to cultural context—a principle I see VinGroup applying through your ecosystem approach, from real estate to retail. I want to learn how your management trainees navigate the tension between scalable processes and localized relationships."

### Your Task (5 min)

**Individually:**
1. Read all four excerpts
2. Identify which TWO are workslop
3. For each workslop excerpt, write down specific evidence:
   - What makes it feel AI-generated?
   - What's missing that a human would include?
   - How does it fail the 30-Second Test?

### Pair Discussion (5 min)

**With Your Partner:**
1. Compare your workslop identifications
2. Did you agree? If not, debate the evidence
3. For the piloted excerpts, identify what makes them stronger:
   - Specific details vs. generic claims
   - Personal voice vs. templated language
   - Genuine insight vs. surface-level statements

### Class Debrief (10 min)

**Tutor Reveals Answers:**
- Excerpts A and C are workslop
- Excerpts B and D are piloted

**Evidence Breakdown:**

**Excerpt A (Workslop):**
- "Express my strong interest" = templated opening
- "Consistently demonstrated" = vague claim with no evidence
- "Innovative approach" = generic praise, no specifics
- "Ideal candidate" = every cover letter says this
- Zero personalization, could be sent to any company
- No evidence the writer knows anything about VinGroup specifically

**Excerpt C (Workslop):**
- "Strong foundation in business principles" = meaningless filler
- Lists generic skills without examples
- "Eager to apply these skills" = every student says this
- "Perfect opportunity for growth" = cliché
- "Learning from industry leaders" = vague, unspecific
- Entire paragraph could be copied to any trainee program

**Excerpt B (Piloted):**
- Specific VinFast showroom visit = personal initiative
- Strategic observation about sales approach = analytical thinking
- Connection to actual coursework = demonstrates relevance
- Shows genuine knowledge of company strategy
- Authentic voice with specific details

**Excerpt D (Piloted):**
- Memorable professor quote = personal touch
- Specific comparison: email vs. face-to-face survey = real project detail
- 5% vs. 78% response rate = quantified evidence
- Cultural insight about relationships in Vietnam = thoughtful
- Connection to VinGroup's ecosystem strategy = research-backed
- Demonstrates both practical experience and strategic thinking

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What patterns did you notice in workslop vs. piloted content?
2. If you received Excerpt A or C as a hiring manager, how would you feel?
3. How can you ensure YOUR cover letters don't sound like A and C?

**Key Takeaway:**
Workslop is characterized by: generic claims, templated language, lack of specific details, vague praise, absence of genuine insight. Piloted content includes: specific examples, personal voice, evidence of research, concrete details, authentic connection to opportunity. The difference is YOUR thinking and judgment.

## Activity 3: Explore-Build-Connect-Refine Application (35 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** This activity directly models how you'll prepare for your Mentorship Program. Each stage of the framework (Explore-Build-Connect-Refine) maps to specific mentorship activities: EXPLORE = identifying discussion topics, BUILD = drafting professional materials, CONNECT = preparing for meetings, REFINE = quality-checking your preparation and reflection forms. Practicing now ensures your first mentor meeting goes well.

**The Challenge:**
You'll work through all four stages of the framework to prepare ONE career development artifact: a 60-second elevator pitch tailored to your field of interest.

### Stage 1: EXPLORE (8 min)

**Objective:** Use AI to map possibilities and surface gaps in your self-understanding.

**Your Task:**
Interview AI about career pathways related to your interests. The goal is expanding your awareness, not getting AI to decide for you.

**Suggested Prompts:**

```
I'm a second-year business student in Vietnam interested in [marketing/finance/consulting/entrepreneurship/sustainability/etc.].

What are 5 different career pathways in this field that combine analytical skills with creative problem-solving?
```

```
I have experience in [list 2-3 things: coursework, projects, volunteer work]. Based on these experiences, what competencies could I claim on a CV or in an interview?
```

```
What skills do employers in [your target industry] in Vietnam prioritize in entry-level candidates? Compare Vietnamese companies vs. multinational companies if there are differences.
```

**Your Task:**
1. Choose 1-2 prompts above (or write your own EXPLORE prompts)
2. Generate AI responses
3. Document 2-3 insights that surprised you or expanded your thinking
4. Identify one gap: What skill do employers want that you need to develop?

**Example Insight:**
"I thought marketing was mostly creativity, but AI showed me data analytics is now essential—5 out of 5 job descriptions mentioned A/B testing, customer segmentation, or marketing analytics. Gap: I need to build quantitative marketing skills."

### Stage 2: BUILD (10 min)

**Objective:** Use AI to practice and iterate your elevator pitch.

**Your Task:**
Draft a 60-second elevator pitch (approximately 100-120 words) that introduces you to a potential mentor or employer in your target field.

**Structure:**
1. Who you are (name, year, program)
2. What you're interested in (be specific—not just "business")
3. What relevant experience or skills you bring
4. What you're seeking (mentorship, advice, internship opportunity)

**Pilot Approach:**

**Step 1 - Brain Dump (2 min):**
Write rough notes answering the four structure points above. Don't worry about polish.

**Step 2 - AI First Draft (3 min):**
```
I need a 60-second elevator pitch for [context: career fair / informational interview / mentor meeting].

About me:
[Paste your rough notes]

Tone: [Professional but approachable / Confident but humble / Enthusiastic about learning]
Audience: [Recruiter from consulting firm / Senior manager in FMCG / Startup founder]

Draft a pitch that sounds conversational (like I'm actually speaking), includes one specific detail that makes me memorable, and ends with a clear ask.
```

**Step 3 - Refine for Voice (5 min):**
Read AI's draft out loud. Identify:
- Phrases that don't sound like YOU
- Jargon you wouldn't naturally use
- Sentences that are too long or complex for speaking
- Generic statements that could apply to anyone

Rewrite to sound authentically like you're talking to someone.

**Your Deliverable:**
One polished elevator pitch (practice saying it out loud—does it take ~60 seconds?).

### Stage 3: CONNECT (7 min)

**Objective:** Practice adapting your pitch for different audiences.

**Your Task:**
Test your elevator pitch with AI roleplaying different professional audiences.

**Suggested Prompt:**
```
Roleplay scenario: You are a [senior manager at a consulting firm / startup founder / HR recruiter at a multinational company].

I'm going to deliver my elevator pitch to you. After I share it, you will:
1. Ask 2-3 follow-up questions that person would realistically ask
2. Provide feedback on what resonated vs. what could be stronger

Here's my pitch:
[Paste your refined pitch from BUILD stage]
```

**Your Task:**
1. Run this simulation with at least ONE professional persona
2. Note what questions they asked—are you prepared to answer those in a real interaction?
3. Note their feedback—what adjustments would make your pitch stronger?

**Pair Practice:**
- Deliver your pitch to your partner (out loud, as if they're the professional)
- Partner provides feedback:
  - Did it sound natural or rehearsed/robotic?
  - What was the most memorable detail?
  - Was the ask clear?
- Switch roles

### Stage 4: REFINE (10 min)

**Objective:** Apply quality control to ensure your pitch passes the 30-Second Test.

**The 30-Second Test:**
If a busy professional heard your pitch, would they think:
- "This person has thought carefully about their career and knows what they want" (PASS)
- "This sounds like a generic student pitch / AI template" (FAIL)

**Your Task:**

**Refinement Checklist:**
- [ ] **Specificity Test:** Is there at least one specific detail (project, company, insight) that makes you memorable?
- [ ] **Voice Test:** If someone who knows you heard this, would they recognize it as YOUR voice?
- [ ] **Jargon Test:** Have you eliminated business jargon you wouldn't naturally use?
- [ ] **Clarity Test:** Is your ask crystal clear? (Not "I'd love to learn more" but "Could I schedule a 20-minute informational interview?")
- [ ] **Length Test:** When spoken aloud at conversational pace, is it 50-70 seconds? (Allows for natural pauses)
- [ ] **Authenticity Test:** Does this pitch reflect genuine interest or generic career aspirations?

**AI-Assisted Pressure Test:**
```
Review this elevator pitch as a skeptical hiring manager would. What weaknesses or areas for improvement would you identify? Be critical.

[Paste your pitch]
```

**Your Task:**
1. Run your pitch through the refinement checklist
2. Get AI critique
3. Make final adjustments
4. Practice delivering it one more time to ensure it feels natural

**Final Deliverable:**
A polished, authentic elevator pitch you could confidently deliver this week at your first Mentorship Program meeting.

## Reflection & Action Planning (10 minutes)

**Individual Reflection (5 min):**

Answer these questions in your notes (these will help with your Mentorship Program reflection forms):

1. **Context Engineering:** What surprised you about the difference between your Passenger approach and Goldilocks approach in Activity 1?

2. **Workslop Awareness:** Before today, had you ever produced workslop without realizing it? What will you do differently now?

3. **Framework Application:** Which stage of Explore-Build-Connect-Refine do you think is your biggest gap?
   - [ ] EXPLORE: I don't know enough about career options and what employers want
   - [ ] BUILD: I struggle to create professional materials (CV, cover letters, pitches)
   - [ ] CONNECT: Networking and professional communication intimidate me
   - [ ] REFINE: I have trouble judging whether my work is good enough

4. **Pilot vs. Passenger:** Thinking about your AI use for schoolwork so far this semester, are you typically a pilot or passenger? What's one specific change you'll make?

**Action Planning (5 min):**

Based on today's tutorial, identify your immediate next steps:

**Before Your First Mentor Meeting:**
- [ ] Use EXPLORE stage to research your mentor's company and role
- [ ] Prepare 3-5 thoughtful questions using context engineering (not generic questions)
- [ ] Draft your elevator pitch and practice delivering it
- [ ] Run all preparation materials through the 30-Second Test

**This Week:**
- [ ] Experiment with AI for one course assignment using pilot mindset
- [ ] Document what produces quality output vs. workslop
- [ ] Read this week's required readings if you haven't yet (context engineering article especially)

**Throughout Mentorship Program:**
- [ ] Before each meeting: EXPLORE + BUILD to prepare materials
- [ ] During each meeting: CONNECT authentically (don't just read scripted questions)
- [ ] After each meeting: REFINE your reflection to ensure depth, not workslop

**For Personal Development Plan:**
- [ ] Use EXPLORE to research career pathways and identify skill gaps (informs SWOT analysis)
- [ ] Use BUILD to draft goal statements and action plans
- [ ] Use REFINE to ensure final plan reflects YOUR authentic thinking, not AI templates

## Key Takeaways

**What You Learned Today:**

1. **Context engineering beats prompt engineering:** The Goldilocks principle, minimum effective dose, and attention budget awareness transform AI from generic template generator to strategic thought partner.

2. **Workslop is a career killer:** 41% of professionals encounter it, 50% judge senders as less capable, 1 in 10 job seekers rejected—your reputation depends on avoiding it.

3. **The 30-Second Test is your quality control:** Before submitting any AI-assisted work, ask: Would someone recognize this as thoughtful human work?

4. **Explore-Build-Connect-Refine is your framework:** Each stage has specific AI applications; judgment is required at every stage to be a pilot, not passenger.

5. **Practice builds judgment:** You won't master AI use today—but every experiment (like the three CV approaches) builds your ability to recognize what works.

**Remember:**
- AI is a tool that amplifies your capabilities—but only if YOU provide strategic direction
- Your Mentorship Program begins this week: apply everything you learned today
- Bring questions to next lecture if you encounter challenges

**Resources for Continued Learning:**
- Week 2 required readings (especially the Chremos & Repetto framework article)
- Office hours if you want feedback on AI-assisted materials before submitting
- Your mentor (ask them: "How do you use AI in your work? What mistakes do you see people make?")

## Homework / Preparation for Next Week

**Required:**
1. Complete Week 2 readings if not yet done
2. Prepare for first Mentorship Program meeting using Explore-Build-Connect-Refine
3. Bring questions about AI use to next lecture

**Recommended:**
1. Experiment: Use AI to help with one assignment this week, documenting your process (What context did you provide? How did you refine outputs? Did you produce workslop or quality work?)
2. Update your CV with one new bullet point using context engineering principles
3. Practice your elevator pitch with a friend or family member

**Next Week Preview:**
Week 3 focuses on Reflection and Reflective Learning (Gibbs' Cycle, Kolb's Cycle). We'll learn structured frameworks for extracting insights from experiences—including your Mentorship Program meetings and today's tutorial. The reflection skills you develop next week are essential for your Reflective Essay (10%) and will make your Mentorship Program reflections much stronger.
