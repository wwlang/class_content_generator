    topic: "Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model"

    question: |
      What are the three phases in Zimmerman's cyclical model of self-regulated learning?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Forethought, Performance, and Self-Reflection"
        feedback: "Correct! Zimmerman's cyclical model consists of three phases: Forethought (goal setting and strategic planning), Performance (self-control and self-observation), and Self-Reflection (self-judgment and self-reaction). These phases cycle continuously."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Planning, Execution, and Evaluation"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these terms are similar in meaning, Zimmerman's specific terminology is Forethought, Performance, and Self-Reflection. The precise terms matter for understanding the theoretical framework."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Preparation, Action, and Review"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are general learning process stages, but not Zimmerman's specific three-phase model. The model uses Forethought, Performance, and Self-Reflection phases."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Goal-Setting, Monitoring, and Adjustment"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While goal-setting occurs in the Forethought phase and monitoring occurs in Performance, these don't represent Zimmerman's three phases. The complete model is Forethought, Performance, and Self-Reflection."

    general_feedback: |
      Zimmerman's three-phase cyclical model: (1) **Forethought Phase**—occurs before learning, includes goal setting, strategic planning, and self-efficacy beliefs; (2) **Performance Phase**—occurs during learning, includes self-control strategies (attention focusing, self-instruction) and self-observation (self-recording, self-experimentation); (3) **Self-Reflection Phase**—occurs after learning, includes self-judgment (self-evaluation, causal attribution) and self-reaction (self-satisfaction, adaptive/defensive responses). The cycle repeats continuously—reflection informs next forethought phase. See Week 4 slides 6-11.

    topic: "Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model"

    question: |
      A student sets a specific goal ("I will master self-regulated learning concepts by Friday"), chooses active learning strategies (concept mapping and self-testing), and believes their effort will lead to success. Which phase of Zimmerman's model is this student demonstrating?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Forethought Phase, because goal setting, strategic planning, and self-efficacy beliefs all occur before learning begins"
        feedback: "Correct! This student is demonstrating the Forethought Phase. Goal setting (specific goal by Friday), strategic planning (choosing concept mapping and self-testing), and self-efficacy beliefs (belief that effort leads to success) are all components of the Forethought Phase that occur before beginning the learning activity."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Performance Phase, because the student is actively engaging with learning strategies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While the student HAS chosen strategies, they haven't yet implemented them. The Performance Phase occurs DURING learning when students use self-control and self-observation. This scenario describes preparation BEFORE learning begins—that's the Forethought Phase."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Self-Reflection Phase, because the student is evaluating their capabilities"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Self-Reflection occurs AFTER learning, involving self-judgment about achievement and self-reaction to outcomes. This student is preparing BEFORE learning—that's Forethought. They're not reflecting on completed learning; they're planning future learning."

      - key: "D"
        text: "All three phases simultaneously, because self-regulated learning is holistic"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While the three phases form a continuous cycle, they are temporally distinct: Forethought occurs BEFORE learning, Performance DURING, and Self-Reflection AFTER. This scenario describes activities that occur before learning begins—only the Forethought Phase."

    general_feedback: |
      The **Forethought Phase** occurs before learning begins and includes two main components: (1) **Task Analysis**—goal setting (specific, proximal goals) and strategic planning (selecting appropriate methods); (2) **Self-Motivation Beliefs**—self-efficacy (confidence in capability), outcome expectations (belief effort leads to results), task interest/value (why it matters), and goal orientation (learning vs. performance goals). This phase sets up the learning cycle. Students strong in forethought plan systematically before studying; students weak in forethought dive into studying without preparation. See Week 4 slide 9.

    topic: "Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model"

    question: |
      During a study session, a student tracks how much time they spend on each topic, notes which concepts require more review, and experiments with different note-taking formats to see which works best. This student is demonstrating which component of self-regulated learning?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Self-observation within the Performance Phase"
        feedback: "Correct! Self-observation is a component of the Performance Phase occurring DURING learning. It includes self-recording (tracking time, noting difficult concepts) and self-experimentation (testing different note-taking approaches). This metacognitive monitoring helps students understand what's working and adjust strategies in real-time."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Self-judgment within the Self-Reflection Phase"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Self-judgment occurs AFTER learning and involves evaluating whether goals were achieved and attributing causes. This scenario describes activities DURING the study session (tracking time, noting difficulties, experimenting)—that's self-observation in the Performance Phase, not post-learning reflection."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Strategic planning within the Forethought Phase"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Strategic planning occurs BEFORE learning begins, when students select which methods to use. This scenario describes activities DURING the study session—tracking progress and experimenting with approaches in real-time. That's self-observation in the Performance Phase."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Metacognitive knowledge about learning strategies"
        feedback: "Partially correct but not the best answer. While self-observation does involve metacognition, the specific Zimmerman model component this describes is self-observation within the Performance Phase. Self-observation includes self-recording and self-experimentation—exactly what the scenario describes."

    general_feedback: |
      **Self-observation** is a component of the Performance Phase, occurring DURING learning. It includes: (1) **Self-recording**—systematically tracking aspects of learning (time spent, topics covered, progress toward goals, difficulties encountered); (2) **Self-experimentation**—trying different strategies to see what works best for you (testing note-taking formats, study locations, time intervals). Self-observation provides data for the Self-Reflection Phase—you can't effectively reflect on what worked if you didn't observe during learning. This monitoring distinguishes self-regulated learners from passive students who study without awareness of effectiveness. See Week 4 slide 10.

    question: |
      What are the four steps in the University of Waterloo's self-directed learning process?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Assess Readiness to Learn, Set Learning Goals, Engage in Learning Process, Evaluate Learning"
        feedback: "Correct! Waterloo's four-step SDL process: (1) Assess Readiness to Learn—evaluate attitudes, abilities, and characteristics; (2) Set Learning Goals—create learning contracts specifying what, how, evidence, and when; (3) Engage in Learning Process—identify resources, select strategies, monitor progress; (4) Evaluate Learning—self-reflection and external feedback."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Plan, Act, Observe, Reflect"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these are general action research cycle steps, they don't match Waterloo's specific four-step SDL framework. The SDL process is: Assess Readiness, Set Goals, Engage, Evaluate."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Identify Needs, Develop Strategies, Implement Plans, Review Outcomes"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are similar concepts but not Waterloo's specific terminology. The four steps are: Assess Readiness to Learn, Set Learning Goals, Engage in Learning Process, and Evaluate Learning."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Prepare, Execute, Monitor, Adjust"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While self-directed learning involves these activities, Waterloo's specific four steps are: Assess Readiness to Learn, Set Learning Goals, Engage in Learning Process, and Evaluate Learning."

    general_feedback: |
      **Waterloo's Four-Step SDL Process** provides practical structure for self-directed learning: **Step 1: Assess Readiness to Learn**—evaluate your attitudes (motivation, curiosity), abilities (time management, learning strategies), and characteristics (self-discipline, persistence) to identify what support you need. **Step 2: Set Learning Goals**—create learning contracts with four elements (learning goals, strategies/resources, evidence of accomplishment, timeline). **Step 3: Engage in Learning Process**—identify diverse resources, select appropriate strategies, actively monitor progress. **Step 4: Evaluate Learning**—combine self-reflection (internal evaluation) with external feedback (validation), then plan actions for next cycle. The cycle repeats continuously. See Week 4 slides 14-19.

    topic: "University of Waterloo's Self-Directed Learning Process"

    question: |
      A student writes: "I will understand digital marketing career pathways in Vietnam [goal] by conducting mentor meetings, LinkedIn research, and informational interviews [strategies] as demonstrated by my ability to describe three specific career paths with required competencies [evidence] by Week 8 of the semester [timeline]." What makes this an effective learning contract?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "It includes all four required learning contract elements: specific learning goal, diverse strategies/resources, measurable evidence criteria, and realistic timeline"
        feedback: "Correct! Effective learning contracts require four elements: (1) Learning goal—what specifically will be learned (digital marketing career pathways in Vietnam); (2) Strategies/resources—how it will be learned with multiple approaches (mentor, LinkedIn, informational interviews); (3) Evidence of accomplishment—how achievement will be measured (describe three paths with competencies); (4) Timeline—by when (Week 8). This example includes all four elements with appropriate specificity."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "It focuses on a single learning goal rather than multiple goals, allowing deeper focus"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While focusing on a single goal is good practice, what makes this an effective learning contract isn't the number of goals but the presence of all four required elements: learning goal, strategies/resources, evidence of accomplishment, and timeline. The question is about learning contract structure, not goal quantity."

      - key: "C"
        text: "It emphasizes understanding over skills development, which is more appropriate for academic learning"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Learning contracts work equally well for understanding (conceptual knowledge) and skills development (practical capabilities). What makes this effective isn't the type of learning but having all four required elements: goal, strategies, evidence, and timeline."

      - key: "D"
        text: "It includes mentor involvement, which is required for all learning contracts in this course"
        feedback: "Partially correct but incomplete. While mentor involvement strengthens contracts (especially for Mentorship Program assessment), what fundamentally makes this an effective learning contract is including all four required elements: learning goal, strategies/resources (which happens to include mentor), evidence of accomplishment, and timeline. The structure matters most."

    general_feedback: |
      **Learning contracts** have four essential elements: (1) **Learning Goals**—specific, measurable objectives answering "What will I learn?"; (2) **Strategies & Resources**—diverse approaches answering "How will I learn it?" (should include human resources like mentors, information resources like courses/books, and experiential resources like practice opportunities); (3) **Evidence of Accomplishment**—measurable criteria answering "How will I know I've learned it?" (must be objectively assessable, not vague feelings); (4) **Timeline**—specific deadlines answering "By when?" (should include milestone checkpoints, not just final deadline). Learning contracts create accountability by making vague intentions ("I want to improve...") into specific, measurable commitments. See Week 4 slide 17.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "University of Waterloo's Self-Directed Learning Process"

    question: |
      According to Waterloo's SDL framework, assessing readiness to learn involves evaluating three dimensions: attitudes, abilities, and characteristics. Which of the following correctly matches examples to these dimensions?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Attitudes: Curiosity and motivation; Abilities: Time management and learning strategies; Characteristics: Self-discipline and persistence"
        feedback: "Correct! **Attitudes** refer to mindsets and orientations (curiosity about learning, motivation to take initiative, openness to new experiences). **Abilities** are learnable skills (time management, learning strategy knowledge, information literacy). **Characteristics** are personal qualities (self-discipline, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity). Understanding these three dimensions helps identify SDL readiness and what support is needed."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Attitudes: Intelligence and talent; Abilities: Study skills; Characteristics: Personality type"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Intelligence/talent aren't attitudes (which are mindsets like curiosity and motivation). Study skills are abilities, which is correct. Personality type isn't a characteristic in this framework (which focuses on qualities like self-discipline and persistence). The correct matching is: Attitudes = curiosity/motivation; Abilities = time management/learning strategies; Characteristics = self-discipline/persistence."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Attitudes: Interest in the subject; Abilities: Prior knowledge; Characteristics: Learning style preference"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While subject interest relates to attitudes, prior knowledge is content background (not an ability to self-direct), and learning style preference isn't part of SDL readiness assessment (especially given that learning styles lack empirical support). The framework focuses on: Attitudes = curiosity/motivation; Abilities = time management/strategies; Characteristics = self-discipline/persistence."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Attitudes: Confidence; Abilities: Academic performance; Characteristics: Cultural background"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Confidence relates to self-efficacy (a motivation factor) but isn't the primary attitude assessed. Academic performance is an outcome, not an ability for self-direction. Cultural background may influence SDL but isn't a characteristic assessed. The three dimensions are: Attitudes = curiosity/motivation; Abilities = time management/learning strategies; Characteristics = self-discipline/persistence."

    general_feedback: |
      **Step 1: Assess Readiness to Learn** involves honest self-evaluation across three dimensions: (1) **Attitudes**—your mindsets and orientations toward learning: Are you curious? Motivated? Open to learning? Do you see learning as personally relevant or just compliance? (2) **Abilities**—learnable skills for self-direction: Do you have time management skills? Learning strategy knowledge? Information literacy? Can you evaluate source quality? (3) **Characteristics**—personal qualities supporting SDL: Are you self-disciplined (work without external pressure)? Persistent (continue when challenged)? Tolerant of ambiguity (comfortable when path isn't fully clear)? Low readiness means you need more scaffolding; high readiness means you can operate more independently. SDL readiness is **developable**, not fixed. See Week 4 slide 16.

    topic: "Metacognition and Evidence-Based Learning Strategies"

    question: |
      According to Stanton et al. (2021), what are the three components of metacognition?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive monitoring, and metacognitive control"
        feedback: "Correct! The three components of metacognition are: (1) Metacognitive knowledge—what you know about how you learn (self-knowledge, task knowledge, strategy knowledge); (2) Metacognitive monitoring—assessing your current understanding and calibration accuracy; (3) Metacognitive control—adjusting strategies based on monitoring. These three components work together to make learning processes conscious and improvable."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Thinking about thinking, learning about learning, and planning about planning"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While 'thinking about thinking' is a general definition of metacognition, these aren't the three specific components identified by research. Stanton et al. identify: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive monitoring, and metacognitive control."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Self-awareness, self-assessment, and self-improvement"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these relate to metacognition, they aren't the specific three components from the metacognition research framework. The three components are: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive monitoring, and metacognitive control."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Cognitive strategies, metacognitive strategies, and resource management strategies"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are categories of learning strategies in some frameworks, but not the three components of metacognition. Metacognition's three components are: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive monitoring, and metacognitive control."

    general_feedback: |
      **Metacognition** means "thinking about thinking"—awareness and control of your cognitive processes. The three components: (1) **Metacognitive Knowledge**—what you know about learning: self-knowledge ("I learn concepts better through examples"), task knowledge ("Understanding theories requires elaboration"), strategy knowledge ("Self-testing reveals gaps better than rereading"); (2) **Metacognitive Monitoring**—assessing current understanding in real-time: "Do I really understand this or just feel familiar?" Includes calibration accuracy—knowing what you actually know vs. what you think you know; (3) **Metacognitive Control**—adjusting strategies based on monitoring: "This isn't working—I'll try a different approach." These create a feedback loop: knowledge informs monitoring, monitoring triggers control, control builds knowledge. See Week 4 slide 23.

    topic: "Metacognition and Evidence-Based Learning Strategies"

    question: |
      Why do cognitive scientists and educational psychologists consider learning styles (VARK, Kolb) to be an educational myth?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Research has found no evidence supporting the 'meshing hypothesis'—that matching instruction to learning styles improves learning outcomes"
        feedback: "Correct! The 'meshing hypothesis' claims that matching instruction to students' learning styles (visual, auditory, etc.) enhances learning. Despite decades of research, no empirical evidence supports this. Pashler et al. (2008) reviewed all learning styles research and found 'virtually no evidence' for the hypothesis. Studies directly testing matched vs. mismatched instruction show NO DIFFERENCE in learning outcomes. People have learning preferences (comfort), but preferences don't equal effectiveness."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Everyone has the same learning style, so the concept of different styles is meaningless"
        feedback: "Incorrect. People DO have learning preferences—they feel more comfortable with certain approaches. The problem isn't that preferences don't exist; it's that matching instruction to preferences doesn't improve learning effectiveness. Research shows evidence-based strategies work for everyone regardless of preferences."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Learning styles change too frequently to be useful for instructional planning"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The issue isn't that learning styles change frequently (though some models suggest they can). The fundamental problem is that NO EVIDENCE shows matching instruction to supposed learning styles improves learning. The meshing hypothesis lacks empirical support across decades of research."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Brain imaging studies have proven that all students process information identically"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Brain imaging shows individual differences in processing, but that's not why learning styles are considered a myth. The issue is that matching instruction to supposed learning styles doesn't improve learning outcomes—the 'meshing hypothesis' lacks empirical support despite extensive research testing it."

    general_feedback: |
      **The learning styles myth** is the belief that matching instruction to students' learning styles (VARK: Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic; or Kolb's four styles) improves learning. **The meshing hypothesis** is the claim that visual learners learn better from visual instruction, auditory learners from auditory instruction, etc. **The evidence:** After decades of research, **NO empirical support** exists for the meshing hypothesis (Pashler et al., 2008). Studies comparing matched vs. mismatched instruction show **NO DIFFERENCE** in learning outcomes. **What's true instead:** You have learning **preferences** (comfort), not learning **styles** (effectiveness). Multiple modalities benefit everyone. Evidence-based strategies (retrieval practice, spaced practice) work regardless of preferences. **Why it persists:** Feels intuitively right, confirms self-perceptions, widely promoted in popular education books despite being scientifically debunked. See Week 4 slide 24.

    topic: "Metacognition and Evidence-Based Learning Strategies"

    question: |
      A student studies Week 4 content by closing all notes and writing everything they remember about Zimmerman's three-phase model, then checking accuracy and restudying what they missed. Which evidence-based learning strategy is this student using, and why is it effective?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Retrieval practice—actively recalling information from memory strengthens retention more than passively restudying material"
        feedback: "Correct! This is retrieval practice (also called the testing effect). Actively retrieving information from memory (writing what you remember without notes) strengthens neural pathways more effectively than passive restudying. Each successful retrieval makes future retrieval easier. Research shows retrieval practice produces better long-term retention than rereading, even though rereading feels easier and creates illusions of competence. This strategy has HIGH effectiveness ratings."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Spaced practice—distributing study over multiple sessions separated by time intervals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While spacing study sessions over time IS an evidence-based strategy with high effectiveness, this scenario describes what happens WITHIN a single study session—closing notes and testing recall. That's retrieval practice. Spaced practice would be: study Monday, review Wednesday, test Friday—distributing practice over time."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Elaboration—asking 'why' and 'how' questions to create meaningful connections"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Elaboration involves asking questions that force deeper processing ('Why does self-reflection connect to forethought?' 'How does this apply to my mentorship?'). This scenario describes testing yourself by recalling information from memory without notes—that's retrieval practice, not elaboration."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Interleaving—mixing different topics during study rather than blocking by topic"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Interleaving means mixing topics (20 min Zimmerman, 20 min Waterloo, 20 min metacognition, repeat) rather than mastering one topic completely before moving to the next. This scenario describes testing yourself on content by recalling from memory—that's retrieval practice."

    general_feedback: |
      **Retrieval practice** (self-testing) means actively recalling information from memory rather than passively restudying. Methods include: self-quizzing without notes, flashcards (testing yourself, not just reviewing), practice problems without solution guides, teaching concepts to someone else (revealing gaps). **Why effective:** The "testing effect"—each successful retrieval strengthens memory more than restudying. Retrieving information creates stronger neural pathways than recognizing familiar text. **Common mistake:** Students reread notes (passive recognition) instead of testing themselves (active retrieval). Rereading creates **illusions of competence**—information feels familiar, but you can't recall it independently. Rated HIGH effectiveness by Dunlosky et al. (2013). See Week 4 slide 25.

    topic: "Metacognition and Evidence-Based Learning Strategies"

    question: |
      Why is spaced practice (distributed practice) more effective than massed practice (cramming) for long-term retention?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Spacing forces memory consolidation and reconsolidation—partially forgetting between sessions requires active reconstruction, which strengthens learning"
        feedback: "Correct! Spaced practice works because spacing study across multiple sessions separated by time forces memory consolidation (initial strengthening) and reconsolidation (reconstructing partially forgotten information). When you space practice, you partially forget between sessions, then must actively reconstruct understanding—this reconsolidation process strengthens long-term retention. Cramming produces short-term familiarity but weak long-term retention because information never undergoes consolidation/reconsolidation cycles."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Spacing allows more total study time compared to cramming in a single session"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Spaced practice is effective even with EQUAL total study time. Four 1-hour sessions (spaced) produces better retention than one 4-hour session (massed) with identical total time. The benefit comes from spacing intervals forcing consolidation/reconsolidation, not from more total hours."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Spacing prevents cognitive fatigue that occurs during long study sessions"
        feedback: "Partially correct but incomplete. While avoiding fatigue is a benefit of shorter sessions, the MAIN reason spaced practice enhances learning is that spacing forces memory consolidation and reconsolidation. You partially forget between sessions, then must actively reconstruct—this strengthens retention. Preventing fatigue is a secondary benefit."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Spacing matches students' natural learning style preferences better than cramming"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Spaced practice works for ALL learners regardless of preferences—it's not about matching learning styles (which lack empirical support). Spaced practice is effective because spacing forces memory consolidation and reconsolidation cycles. Most students actually PREFER cramming (it feels efficient), but spacing is more effective despite preferences."

    general_feedback: |
      **Spaced practice** (distributed practice) means studying across multiple sessions separated by time rather than one long session. Example: Study Monday 1 hour, review Wednesday 1 hour, test Friday 1 hour, final review next Monday = 4 hours spaced vs. 4-hour Sunday cramming session = 4 hours massed. **Why effective:** Spacing forces **memory consolidation** (initial strengthening after learning) and **reconsolidation** (reconstructing partially forgotten information). When you space practice, you partially forget between sessions, then must actively reconstruct understanding—this reconsolidation strengthens long-term retention. **Cramming** produces short-term familiarity ("I just studied this") but weak long-term retention—information never consolidates deeply. Rated HIGH effectiveness. See Week 4 slide 25.

    topic: "Metacognition and Evidence-Based Learning Strategies"

    question: |
      A student learning about self-regulated learning asks themselves: "Why does the self-reflection phase connect back to the forethought phase?" and "How does this apply to my mentorship meeting preparation?" Which evidence-based learning strategy is this student using?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Elaboration—asking 'why' and 'how' questions to create meaningful connections and deeper processing"
        feedback: "Correct! Elaboration means asking questions that force deeper processing: 'Why?' questions explore reasons and causes. 'How?' questions explore mechanisms and applications. Elaboration also includes connecting new information to prior knowledge ('How does this relate to what I already know about reflection?') and generating your own examples ('How does SRL apply to my mentorship?'). This creates meaningful connections rather than superficial memorization, leading to better understanding and retention. Rated MODERATE effectiveness."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Retrieval practice—actively recalling information from memory to strengthen retention"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Retrieval practice involves testing yourself by recalling information without notes. While asking questions CAN prompt retrieval, these specific questions ('Why does X connect to Y?' 'How does this apply?') are designed to deepen understanding by creating connections—that's elaboration, not retrieval."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Metacognitive monitoring—assessing current understanding to identify gaps"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While elaboration involves metacognition, these specific questions are designed to DEEPEN understanding by creating meaningful connections, not primarily to ASSESS understanding. Metacognitive monitoring questions would be: 'Do I really understand this?' 'Can I explain this without notes?' The 'why' and 'how' questions in this scenario represent elaboration."

        text: "Interleaving—mixing different topics to force discrimination between concepts"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Interleaving means alternating between different topics or problem types during study (20 min Topic A, 20 min Topic B, 20 min Topic C, repeat) rather than mastering one completely before moving to next. This scenario describes asking questions to deepen understanding within a topic—that's elaboration."

    general_feedback: |
      **Elaboration** means asking questions that force deeper processing rather than superficial memorization. Techniques: (1) **Elaborative interrogation**—asking "Why?" questions: "Why does this happen?" "Why is this true?" "Why does X connect to Y?" (2) **Self-explanation**—asking "How?" questions: "How does this work?" "How does this apply to [situation]?" "How would I use this?" (3) **Connecting to prior knowledge**: "How does this relate to what I already know?" (4) **Generating your own examples**: "What's a concrete example from my experience?" Elaboration creates meaningful associations and deeper understanding rather than rote memorization. Rated MODERATE effectiveness by Dunlosky et al. (2013). See Week 4 slide 25.

    question: |
      Your Personal Development Plan requires SMART goals with action plans, progress monitoring approaches, and reflection mechanisms. How do Zimmerman's SRL model and Waterloo's SDL process support creating an effective PDP?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Zimmerman's forethought phase guides goal-setting and planning; performance phase structures monitoring; self-reflection phase provides evaluation approach. Waterloo's learning contracts provide the specific format for each goal."
        feedback: "Correct! The frameworks integrate: **Zimmerman's model** provides the psychological process—forethought phase (goal setting, strategic planning) informs your PDP goal creation and action plans; performance phase (self-observation, self-monitoring) structures how you'll track progress; self-reflection phase (self-judgment, adaptive responses) guides your quarterly reviews. **Waterloo's learning contracts** provide the practical format—each PDP SMART goal is essentially a learning contract with: goal, strategies/resources, evidence criteria, timeline. Together they transform vague development intentions into structured, accountable plans. See Week 4 slides 12, 20."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "SRL and SDL are theoretical frameworks with no direct application to the PDP assessment"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SRL and SDL frameworks DIRECTLY support PDP development. Your PDP requires: goal-setting (Zimmerman's forethought), action plans (Waterloo's strategies), monitoring approaches (Zimmerman's self-observation), and reflection (Zimmerman's self-reflection phase). Learning contracts provide the exact format for PDP SMART goals. Today's tutorial had you practice learning contracts specifically because they ARE your PDP structure."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Zimmerman's model applies only to academic learning, while the PDP focuses on professional development"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SRL principles apply to ALL types of learning—academic, professional, personal. The three-phase cycle (forethought-performance-reflection) works whether you're learning course content, developing Excel skills, or building presentation confidence. Your PDP includes academic, professional, AND personal development goals—SRL frameworks support all three domains."

      - key: "D"
        text: "The PDP should include only Waterloo's four steps, not Zimmerman's phases, because SDL is more practical"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both frameworks complement each other. Waterloo's SDL process provides practical structure (four steps) while Zimmerman's SRL model explains the psychological processes within each step (how to do forethought effectively, what performance monitoring involves, how to reflect adaptively). Your PDP benefits from both: Waterloo's structure + Zimmerman's depth."

    general_feedback: |
      **PDP Integration:** Your Personal Development Plan (40% of grade) requires: (1) **SMART Goals**—use learning contract format (Waterloo): specific goal, diverse strategies/resources, measurable evidence, realistic timeline with checkpoints; (2) **Action Plans**—Zimmerman's forethought phase guides strategic planning: What strategies will you use? What resources needed? (3) **Progress Monitoring**—Zimmerman's performance phase structures self-observation: How will you track progress? What will you self-record? (4) **Reflection Mechanisms**—Zimmerman's self-reflection phase guides evaluation: How often will you reflect? What criteria will you use for self-judgment? (5) **Adaptive Responses**—Both frameworks emphasize adjustment based on feedback. Your PDP isn't one-time planning—it's continuous self-regulated, self-directed development. See Week 4 slides 12, 20, 28.
