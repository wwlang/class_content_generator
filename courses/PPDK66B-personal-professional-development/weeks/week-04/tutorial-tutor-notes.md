## Why This Activity Matters (Key Message for Students)

**Opening statement:** "Today's tutorial is the most practical session of the course. You're creating two deliverables you'll use IMMEDIATELY: a learning strategy audit that diagnoses what's holding you back, and a learning contract that structures your next mentor meeting AND Section 4 of your Personal Development Plan. Unlike other weeks where we build foundations, today you're building tools you'll use THIS WEEK for Mentor Meeting #2."

**Emphasize throughout session:**
- Learning contracts are used in medical schools (Johns Hopkins), MBA programs (Wharton), and executive coaching—this is a professional development standard
- Mentor Meeting #2 Pre-Meeting Form (due 48 hours before meeting) requires a draft learning contract—today's work IS that draft
- PDP Section 4 evaluates whether you have concrete learning strategies and monitoring systems—your contract provides the structure
- Evidence-based strategies (retrieval, spacing, elaboration, interleaving) have HUNDREDS of peer-reviewed studies supporting them—these aren't opinions, they're facts

## Valid Student Approaches (5-7 Expected Patterns)

Students may legitimately identify different gaps and create different types of learning contracts:

### 1. Weak Forethought Phase → Learning Contract on Goal-Setting Skills
- **Profile:** Student jumps into tasks without planning, then wastes time or misses deadlines
- **Audit Evidence:** "I rated myself 2/5 on forethought—I just open assignments and start, no strategy"
- **Learning Goal Example:** "Develop project planning skills: scope analysis, backward scheduling, milestone setting"
- **Strategies:** Study SMART goals framework, practice creating project timelines, use Trello/Asana for task breakdown
- **Valid because:** Addresses root cause (weak forethought) with structured skill development

### 2. Weak Performance Phase (Distraction) → Learning Contract on Deep Work
- **Profile:** Student knows what to study but can't focus—phone, social media, environment distractions
- **Audit Evidence:** "I rated myself 1/5 on active vs. passive—90% of study time is passive scrolling or rereading"
- **Learning Goal Example:** "Build deep work capacity: sustain focused work for 90 minutes without distraction"
- **Strategies:** Implement Newport's deep work protocols (phone in another room, time-blocking, batch shallow tasks)
- **Valid because:** Targets self-control strategies from Zimmerman's performance phase

### 3. Weak Self-Reflection Phase → Learning Contract on Metacognitive Monitoring
- **Profile:** Student studies but doesn't know if they understand; surprised by poor test performance
- **Audit Evidence:** "I rated myself 2/5 on metacognitive monitoring—I think I know it, then fail the test"
- **Learning Goal Example:** "Improve calibration: accurately judge my understanding before exams"
- **Strategies:** Use retrieval practice (self-testing), track prediction vs. actual test scores, review mistakes systematically
- **Valid because:** Develops self-judgment accuracy through structured feedback loops

### 4. Low Retrieval Practice Use → Learning Contract on Active Study Methods
- **Profile:** Student uses passive strategies (highlighting, rereading) exclusively
- **Audit Evidence:** "I rated myself 1/5 on retrieval practice—I've never used flashcards or self-quizzing"
- **Learning Goal Example:** "Replace passive review with active retrieval for all courses"
- **Strategies:** Create Anki flashcard decks, practice problems before looking at solutions, teach concepts to study partner
- **Valid because:** Direct application of evidence-based strategy to current coursework

### 5. Cramming Habit → Learning Contract on Spaced Practice
- **Profile:** Student consistently crams night before tests; performs okay short-term but forgets quickly
- **Audit Evidence:** "I rated myself 1/5 on spaced practice—I start studying 1 day before every test"
- **Learning Goal Example:** "Develop sustainable study schedule: 30 min/day for 2 weeks before exams instead of 8-hour cram sessions"
- **Strategies:** Create 2-week study calendar, use spaced repetition app, schedule daily review sessions
- **Valid because:** Replaces low-evidence strategy (cramming) with high-evidence strategy (spacing)

### 6. Career Skill Development → Learning Contract on Presentation/Data Analysis/Communication
- **Profile:** Student identifies specific professional skill needed for career path
- **Audit Evidence:** "I want to work in consulting—I need data visualization skills but rated myself 3/10"
- **Learning Goal Example:** "Master Excel data visualization: create professional charts, pivot tables, dashboards"
- **Strategies:** Complete DataCamp course (spaced over 6 weeks), practice with real datasets, apply to group project
- **Valid because:** Aligns with PDP career goals, uses SDL framework for self-directed skill acquisition

### 7. Multiple Weak Areas BUT Strategic Prioritization
- **Profile:** Student has several gaps (weak forethought, low retrieval use, cramming habit)
- **Valid approach:** Choose ONE gap that's most urgent based on upcoming assessments/mentor meeting
- **Tutor guidance:** "Which gap, if fixed in the next 4 weeks, would have the biggest impact on your PDP or next assessment?"
- **Learning Contract Focus:** Single, achievable improvement (not trying to fix everything at once)
- **Valid because:** Demonstrates strategic thinking and realistic self-assessment

## Facilitation Guidance

### Quick Review (5 min)

**Structure:**
- Project the four key concepts on screen:
  1. Zimmerman's Cyclical Phase Model (forethought → performance → self-reflection)
  2. Waterloo's SDL Framework (assess → set goals → engage → evaluate)
  3. Learning Styles Myth (meshing hypothesis has no evidence)
  4. Evidence-Based Strategies (retrieval, spacing, elaboration, interleaving)

**Quick Recall Questions (cold call or volunteers):**
- "Name one thing that happens in Zimmerman's forethought phase" → Expect: goal-setting, strategic planning, self-efficacy
- "Why doesn't matching instruction to learning styles work?" → Expect: meshing hypothesis unsupported, content determines modality
- "Name one HIGH-EVIDENCE learning strategy" → Expect: retrieval practice or spaced practice

**Don't re-teach:** This is recall check, not new lecture. If major confusion, briefly clarify but move on.

**Transition:** "Today you apply these frameworks to YOUR learning. By end of class, you'll have a learning contract ready for Mentor Meeting #2."

### Part 1: Learning Strategy Audit (30 min total)

#### Step 1: Current Habits Inventory (10 min - Individual Work)

**Before they start:**
- Display the 5 categories on screen: Retrieval Practice, Spaced Practice, Elaboration, Active vs. Passive, Metacognitive Monitoring
- Emphasize: "Be HONEST—this is diagnostic, not graded. Lying to yourself helps no one."
- Set timer for 10 minutes, make it visible

**During individual work:**
- Circulate and spot-check for common issues:

**Issue 1: Vague Evidence**
- Student writes: "I'm good at studying"
- Intervention: "Give me a SPECIFIC example from last week—what did you do to prepare for Quiz 3?"
- Push for: "I reread slides 3 times Tuesday night" or "I made flashcards and tested myself daily for 5 days"

**Issue 2: Over-Optimistic Self-Ratings**
- Student rates 4-5/5 on everything without strong evidence
- Intervention: "Everyone has growth areas. What's ONE strategy you DON'T use consistently?"
- Redirect: "What would you rate yourself if I compared you to top students at Stanford or Wharton?"

**Issue 3: Defensive Attributions**
- Student blames teachers/tests for poor performance instead of strategies
- Intervention: "Assume the test was fair—what could you have done differently in your PREPARATION?"
- Frame: "We're looking for controllable factors, not external excuses"

**Issue 4: Confusion About Categories**
- Student doesn't understand "elaboration" or "metacognitive monitoring"
- Quick clarification:
  - Elaboration = asking "why/how," connecting to examples
  - Metacognitive monitoring = knowing whether you understand WHILE you're learning

**If entire class struggles:** Pause at 5 min, clarify one common confusion, resume work.

---

#### Step 2: Identify Weakest Zimmerman Phase (5 min - Individual)

**Before they start:**
- Display Zimmerman's model on screen with bullet points for each phase
- Remind: "This isn't about being bad at learning—it's about finding your growth edge"

**During individual work:**
- Look for students who check boxes in MULTIPLE phases → They're identifying symptoms, not root cause
- Intervention: "If you had to pick ONLY ONE phase as weakest, which would it be? That's where you start."

**Common valid patterns:**
- **Forethought weakness:** "I don't set goals or plan before studying" (very common in Vietnamese context where compliance > autonomy)
- **Performance weakness:** "I get distracted or use passive strategies" (most common overall—execution problem)
- **Self-reflection weakness:** "I don't review what I learned or adjust based on results" (common in students who cram and move on)

**Red flags:**
- Student writes "I'm perfect in all three phases" → Gently challenge with real scenario
- Student writes rambling paragraph instead of choosing ONE → Redirect to decision-making

---

#### Step 3: Identify ONE Habit to Replace (5 min - Individual)

**Before they start:**
- Explain the replacement principle: "Don't just ADD evidence-based strategies on top of bad habits—REPLACE ineffective habits with effective ones"
- Example: "Instead of saying 'I'll also try flashcards,' say 'I'll STOP rereading my notes 5 times and START testing myself with flashcards'"

**During individual work:**
- Check that replacement strategy is SPECIFIC and IMPLEMENTED THIS WEEK
- Weak: "I'll study better" → Push for: "I'll create flashcards for Week 5 readings and quiz myself Friday"
- Weak: "I'll try retrieval practice" → Push for: "After lecture tomorrow, I'll close my notebook and write down everything I remember"

**Validate realistic starting points:**
- Student chooses to implement ONE strategy in ONE course this week = GOOD
- Student plans elaborate system for all courses starting Monday = TOO AMBITIOUS, likely to fail

---

#### Step 4: Pair Share (10 min - Pairs)

**Setup:**
- "Find someone near you—ideally someone you DON'T always work with"
- "Each person gets 4 minutes to share, then 1 minute for partner feedback. I'll call time at 5 min to switch."

**During pair work:**
- Circulate and listen for quality of feedback
- Intervene if feedback is too general: "Be more specific—what EXACTLY should they change in their plan?"
- Highlight good examples: "I like how [Student A] suggested breaking the goal into smaller weekly milestones"

**If pairs finish early:** Have them discuss: "Which Zimmerman phase do you think most students at this university are weakest in? Why?"

**Transition:** "Now you understand your current habits and gaps—let's design a structured plan to improve..."

---

### Part 2: Learning Contract Creation (40 min total)

#### Step 1: Choose Learning Goal (5 min - Individual)

**Before they start:**
- Show examples of GOOD vs. BAD goals on screen:
  - ✅ Good: "Deliver confident 10-min presentation without reading slides"
  - ❌ Bad: "Be better at communication"
  - ✅ Good: "Analyze financial statements to identify investment opportunities"
  - ❌ Bad: "Learn about finance"
- Emphasize: "Specific and measurable is NOT optional—it's required"

**During individual work:**
- Check that goals connect to PDP or career path
- If student is stuck: "What's one skill that would make you more competitive for internships in your field?"
- If goal is too broad: "Break that down—what's ONE specific aspect of [broad skill] you could develop in 6-8 weeks?"

**Common valid goal categories:**
1. **Presentation/communication skills** (delivery, storytelling, visual design)
2. **Technical skills** (Excel, data analysis, programming, financial modeling)
3. **Professional skills** (networking, time management, project planning)
4. **Discipline-specific skills** (market research, case analysis, design thinking)
5. **Meta-learning skills** (note-taking, retrieval practice, focus/concentration)

**Red flags:**
- Goal requires resources student doesn't have access to (expensive software, specialized mentors)
- Goal is too long-term for a 6-8 week contract ("become fluent in Python" for a beginner)
- Goal is about fixed traits, not skills ("be more confident" without specific skill to build)

---

#### Step 2: Assess Current Level (10 min - Individual)

**Before they start:**
- Explain Waterloo Step 1: "Before you plan HOW to learn, assess WHERE you are now—this creates a baseline for measuring progress"
- Template includes: Current rating (1-10), specific evidence, readiness (motivation/knowledge/resources), barriers

**During individual work:**
- Check for HONEST baseline ratings—students often inflate current level
- Test honesty: "If I asked you to demonstrate this skill RIGHT NOW, what could you do? What couldn't you do?"
- Validate realistic barriers: "You identified [barrier]—how will you overcome it? Or should you choose a different goal?"

**Common honest current levels:**
- **3-4/10:** "I've done this once or twice with heavy guidance, can't do independently yet"
- **5-6/10:** "I can do basic version, but lack sophistication/polish"
- **7-8/10:** "I'm competent, want to reach advanced/expert level"

**Red flags:**
- Student rates themselves 1/10 on everything (learned helplessness) → Encourage: "What CAN you do? Start there."
- Student rates themselves 9/10 but wants to learn the skill → Inconsistency, probe further
- Student identifies major barriers but no plan to address them → May need different goal

**Readiness assessment guidance:**
- **Motivation < 3/5:** Challenge goal choice—"If you're not motivated, why learn this? Or what would increase motivation?"
- **Resources < 3/5:** Problem-solve: "What resources DO you have? Can you access what you need through university/mentor/online?"
- **Knowledge (how to learn it) < 3/5:** That's okay—mentor meeting will help

---

#### Step 3: Create Learning Contract (15 min - Individual)

**Before they start:**
- Display filled example on screen (different from tutorial handout examples):

```
WHAT: Improve business email writing in English
Current: 4/10 | Target: 7/10
WHY: Internship applications require professional English correspondence

HOW I WILL LEARN IT:
1. Study 20 example emails from Harvard Business Communication course
   Frequency: 5 emails/week | Duration: 30 min/session
2. Write 3 practice emails/week (customer inquiry, meeting request, follow-up)
   Frequency: 3x/week | Duration: 45 min/email
3. Get feedback from mentor + English tutor
   Frequency: Weekly | Duration: 15 min review

Evidence-Based Strategies:
☑ Retrieval Practice: Write emails from memory, check examples after
☑ Spaced Practice: Review examples Mon/Wed/Fri, write Tue/Thu/Sat
☑ Elaboration: Analyze WHY example emails are effective

Resources: HBR email templates (online), mentor feedback, Grammarly

TIMELINE: 6 weeks (Oct 1 - Nov 15)
- Week 2: Analyze 10 examples, write 3 practice emails
- Week 4: Write 10 emails with feedback, identify patterns in errors
- Week 6: Write 5 emails at target quality level

EVIDENCE:
- Mentor rates email quality 7/10 or higher
- Successfully send internship inquiry email, receive positive response
- Self-rating improvement from 4/10 to 7/10 with specific examples
```

**During individual work:**
- Circulate and check for specificity in ALL sections
- **Most common weakness: Vague "HOW" section**
  - Weak: "I'll practice and study"
  - Strong: "I'll watch 2 YouTube tutorials/week, practice 30 min daily, film myself and review"

**Quality checkpoints:**
- Activities are ACTIVE, not passive (doing/practicing, not just reading/watching)
- Timeline has concrete dates (not "soon" or "when I have time")
- Evidence includes external validation (mentor/peer feedback, performance test), not just self-rating
- At least TWO evidence-based strategies are explicitly incorporated

**Intervention examples:**
- Student writes "I'll read about [skill]" → "Reading is passive. How will you PRACTICE the skill?"
- Student writes "I'll try to improve" → "What SPECIFICALLY will you do on Monday? On Tuesday?"
- Student's timeline is 12 weeks → "Contract should be 4-8 weeks. What can you achieve in 6 weeks?"

---

#### Step 4: Quality Check (5 min - Individual)

**Setup:**
- "Use the checklist in your tutorial handout—be your own quality auditor"
- "If you check NO on any item, revise NOW before peer review"

**During quality check:**
- This is self-directed—don't intervene unless student asks for help
- If student raises hand: "Which checklist item are you stuck on?" → Provide targeted guidance

**Watch for students who rush through without genuine checking:**
- If you see someone check all boxes in 30 seconds → "Walk me through your evidence-based strategies checklist—which two did you choose?"

---

#### Step 5: Peer Review (10 min - Groups of 3)

**Setup:**
- "Form groups of 3—diversity is good, find people with DIFFERENT learning goals if possible"
- "Each person presents for 2 minutes (WHAT, WHY, HOW), then receives 1 minute of feedback from each peer"
- "Feedback should be SPECIFIC: What's working? What needs more clarity?"

**Timing management:**
- Set timer for 3 min per person (2 min present + 1 min feedback) × 3 people = 9 min
- Call out time: "First presenter, go" ... "Feedback time" ... "Second presenter, go"

**During peer review:**
- Circulate between groups, listen to quality of feedback
- Model good feedback if you hear weak examples:
  - Weak: "Looks good"
  - Strong: "Your timeline is realistic, but I don't see how you'll measure progress at Week 2—add a milestone"

**Highlight excellent examples:**
- If you hear a particularly well-designed contract: "Everyone, [Student X] has a really specific evidence section—take a look at how they included external validation"

**Common peer feedback themes to reinforce:**
- "Is the goal specific enough to hand to someone else and they'd know what to do?"
- "Are the strategies ACTIVE or PASSIVE?"
- "Is the timeline realistic given other commitments?"

**Transition:** "Now you have a solid draft—let's prepare for your mentor meeting..."

---

### Part 3: Mentor Meeting #2 Preparation (10 min)

**Setup:**
- "Your learning contract IS your Mentor Meeting #2 preparation—now add context and questions"
- "Pre-Meeting Form is due 48 hours before meeting—draft it NOW while fresh"

**During individual work:**
- Check that summary paragraphs are CONCISE (100-150 words, not 500)
- Check that questions are OPEN-ENDED and SPECIFIC
  - Weak: "Do you think this is good?"
  - Strong: "What resources would you recommend for developing [skill] in [industry]?"

**Intervention if needed:**
- Student's questions are all yes/no → "Rephrase as open-ended: Instead of 'Should I...?', try 'What's your experience with...?'"
- Student's questions are vague → "Add context: 'Given my goal of [X], what do you suggest for [Y]?'"

**Emphasize:** "Your mentor's time is valuable—come with a DRAFT for them to refine, not a blank page for them to fill"

---

### Closing: Class Sharing (5 min)

**Setup:**
- "I need 3-4 volunteers to share: What skill are you developing? Which evidence-based strategy are you using? What's your biggest concern?"
- Select for VARIETY: different skill types, different strategies, different concerns

**During sharing:**
- After each student shares (60-90 seconds), ask class: "Who else is working on a similar skill?" [show of hands]
- Build community: "You can form study partnerships—[Student A] and [Student B] are both working on presentation skills"

**Wrap up:**
- "These learning contracts are YOUR tools—use them, don't file them away"
- "Mentor Meeting #2 happens in next 2 weeks—schedule it THIS WEEK"
- "Try ONE evidence-based strategy TOMORROW, not 'someday'"

---

## Common Student Questions & Responses

### "What if my learning goal changes after talking to my mentor?"

**Response:** "That's EXACTLY what should happen! Your contract is a DRAFT for discussion, not a final commitment. Mentor Meeting #2 is where you refine it based on their expertise. After the meeting, revise your contract and submit the updated version in your Post-Meeting Reflection Form."

**Why this matters:** Students often think contracts are rigid—emphasize iterative refinement.

---

### "Can I have more than one learning goal?"

**Response:** "You CAN, but you SHOULDN'T for this contract. Research on goal-setting shows that focusing on ONE goal dramatically increases success rates. Master one skill in 6-8 weeks, THEN start another. Your PDP will have multiple goals across 1-3-5 years, but your learning contract should be laser-focused on ONE."

**If they push back:** "Which goal, if achieved, would have the BIGGEST impact on your career in the next year? Start there."

---

### "What if I don't know HOW to learn this skill?"

**Response:** "That's totally normal—that's WHY you have a mentor! In your Pre-Meeting Form, ask: 'What resources or strategies did you use when developing [similar skill]?' Your mentor's expertise is the shortcut. Also, low 'Knowledge' score on readiness assessment just means you need guidance—it doesn't mean you can't learn the skill."

**Action:** "Write that as one of your discussion questions for Mentor Meeting #2."

---

### "Is 6-8 weeks enough to actually improve?"

**Response:** "Yes—IF your goal is specific and realistic. You won't become an expert in 6 weeks, but you CAN move from 3/10 to 6/10, or 5/10 to 8/10. The key is FOCUSED, DELIBERATE practice using evidence-based strategies. Research shows that 30 minutes of daily, effortful practice produces measurable skill gains in 4-6 weeks."

**Reference lecture:** "Remember the evidence on spaced practice—distributed effort over time beats cramming."

---

### "What if I fail to stick to my learning contract?"

**Response:** "That's a self-reflection moment! Ask yourself: Why did I fail? (Zimmerman's causal attribution)
- Was the goal too ambitious? → Adjust to smaller scope
- Did I lack motivation? → Was this the right goal to begin with?
- Did I not plan specific actions? → Strengthen the HOW section
- Did life get in the way? → Build buffer time into next contract

Learning contracts aren't pass/fail—they're tools for continuous improvement. If you fail, you LEARN what doesn't work, then design a better contract."

**Normalize failure:** "Professional athletes and executives revise goals constantly—it's called adaptive expertise."

---

### "Do I HAVE to use retrieval practice and spaced practice specifically?"

**Response:** "You have to use AT LEAST TWO evidence-based strategies, but you can choose which ones fit your skill. If you're learning a physical skill (presentation delivery), retrieval practice might be 'practice without notes,' and spacing might be 'practice 3x/week instead of 10 hours the day before.' If you're learning a cognitive skill (financial analysis), retrieval = self-testing on problems, elaboration = explaining steps out loud. Choose strategies that MATCH your goal."

**Why it matters:** "The evidence is clear—highlighting and rereading DON'T work. Retrieval, spacing, elaboration, and interleaving DO work. Use what works."

---

## Materials Needed

### Instructor Should Prepare:
1. **Projected slides/board:** Zimmerman's model, Waterloo framework, evidence-based strategies summary
2. **Example learning contract** (filled-in template showing high-quality specificity)
3. **Timer** (visible to students for time-boxed activities)
4. **Tutorial handout** (if not already distributed—students can also work from digital version)

### Students Should Have:
1. **Tutorial handout** (printed or digital PDF)
2. **Laptop/notebook** for drafting learning contract
3. **Lecture notes** from Week 4 lecture (for reference on evidence-based strategies)

### Optional Supports:
1. **Learning contract template** as fillable PDF (easier for typing)
2. **Example contracts from past students** (with permission, anonymized)
3. **Link to Anki/Quizlet tutorials** for students choosing retrieval practice strategies

## Assessment Connection Reminders (Say Throughout Session)

### Connect to Mentorship Program (20%):
- "Your Pre-Meeting Form for Meeting #2 is assessed on preparation quality—today's contract IS that preparation"
- "Post-Meeting Reflection Form will ask: 'How did mentor feedback improve your learning contract?'—have a draft to improve"

### Connect to PDP (40%):
- "PDP Section 4 requires learning strategies and monitoring approaches—this contract provides the template"
- "Rubric criterion: 'Demonstrates evidence-based approach to skill development'—literally using today's strategies"

### Connect to Reflective Essay (10%):
- "Metacognitive awareness (knowing HOW you learn) will deepen your analysis of field trip and guest speaker experiences"
- "When you reflect on what you learned from Ms. Ha Linh, you'll apply the same self-regulated learning framework"

### Connect to Final Oral Exam (30%):
- "When you present your PDP, examiners will ask: 'How will you develop these skills?'—your learning contract shows you know HOW to learn"

---

## Tutor Self-Reflection After Session

**Debrief questions for your own improvement:**

1. **Participation:** Did all students engage, or did some disengage? If disengaged, why? (Too abstract? Didn't see relevance?)

2. **Quality of contracts:** How many students created SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE contracts vs. vague plans? What intervention would help?

3. **Evidence-based strategy adoption:** Did students genuinely incorporate retrieval/spacing/elaboration, or just check boxes? How to make it real?

4. **Time management:** Did you stay on schedule? Which phase took longer than expected? Adjust timing for next cohort.

5. **Common sticking points:** Where did most students get stuck? (Choosing goal? Assessing current level? Creating timeline?) Address in future sessions.

**Next week preparation:**
- Week 5 involves FOUR self-assessment tools (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, Holland Code)
- Students need laptops and ~60 min to complete assessments
- Ensure computer lab is booked OR students bring devices
- CliftonStrengths requires access codes—confirm distribution before Week 5

## Success Indicators for This Tutorial

**You'll know this session worked if:**

✅ **Immediate (end of class):**
- 90%+ of students have completed a specific learning contract (not vague intentions)
- Students can articulate which Zimmerman phase is their weakest and WHY
- At least 3 students share learning contracts with confidence and specificity

✅ **Short-term (next 2 weeks):**
- Pre-Meeting Forms for Meeting #2 include well-developed learning contracts (not rushed, vague submissions)
- Students report trying at least ONE evidence-based strategy and noticing a difference

✅ **Long-term (Week 11 PDP submission):**
- PDP Section 4 (Learning Strategies) shows clear influence of today's tutorial
- Students include retrieval/spacing/elaboration/interleaving in their development plans
- PDPs demonstrate understanding that learning is a PROCESS (Zimmerman's cycle), not a one-time event

**If these indicators aren't met:** Revisit emphasis on specificity, provide more worked examples, increase accountability for implementation.
