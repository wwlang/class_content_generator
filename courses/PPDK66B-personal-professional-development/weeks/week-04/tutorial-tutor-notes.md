## Why This Activity Matters (Opening Message)

**Opening statement (1-2 minutes):**

"Today's tutorial is one of the most practical sessions of this course. You're creating a tool that professionals use throughout their careers: a learning contract.

Learning contracts are used in:
- Medical education (Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic residency programs)
- MBA programs (Wharton, Harvard Business School executive education)
- Corporate leadership development (McKinsey, Deloitte)
- Professional coaching worldwide

This isn't just an academic exercise. The learning contract you create today:
1. Structures your Mentor Meeting #2 or #3 discussion
2. Becomes part of your Personal Development Plan (Part 2: Skills Gap Analysis)
3. Gives you a template you'll use for the rest of your career when you need to teach yourself anything

By the end of today, you'll have a concrete, actionable plan for developing ONE skill over the next 4-12 weeks. Not vague intentions—a plan with specific strategies, timelines, and success metrics."

---

## Part 1: Selecting Your Learning Goal (15 minutes)

### Facilitation Guidance

**Instructions to students:**
1. "Review the skills you've been thinking about for your PDP—look at your notes from Week 1 (Future of Work AI skills), Week 2 (Career Skills), Week 3 (reflection on what you need to improve)."

2. "Choose ONE skill using these criteria: (1) Relevant to 1-3 year career goals, (2) Feasible in 4-12 weeks, (3) Measurable—you can define 'before' and 'after' levels, (4) Resources available."

3. "Rate your current level honestly on a 1-5 scale."

**Walk around and observe:**
- Are students choosing appropriately scoped goals?
- Are they being honest about current levels (not inflating)?

### Common Student Questions & Responses

**Q: "Can I choose a soft skill like leadership or communication?"**
A: "Yes, but make it specific. Not 'improve leadership' but 'develop meeting facilitation skills: run effective team meetings with clear agendas and outcomes.' The contract works best when you can observe concrete behavioral changes."

**Q: "My skill will take years to master. Does that mean I can't use it?"**
A: "No—define an intermediate milestone. If the ultimate goal is 'become fluent in Japanese,' your 12-week contract might be 'complete JLPT N5 level: basic conversation and 800 kanji.' You're not finishing the skill, you're defining meaningful progress."

**Q: "What if I have three equally important skills?"**
A: "Choose ONE for today. You can create additional learning contracts later—in fact, your PDP will likely have 3-5 learning contracts total. Today is about learning the process with one example."

### What Good Work Looks Like (Examples)

**Strong goal choices:**
- "Develop data visualization skills using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn)"
- "Build Excel proficiency: pivot tables, VLOOKUP, conditional formatting, basic macros"
- "Improve public speaking: deliver 10-minute presentations without notes with natural eye contact"
- "Learn financial statement analysis: read and interpret income statements, balance sheets, cash flow"

**Weak goal choices (redirect these):**
- "Get better at studying" → Too vague. "What specific study skill? Time management? Note-taking? Retrieval practice?"
- "Become a great leader" → Too broad. "What specific leadership behavior in what context?"
- "Learn everything about marketing" → Too large. "Which aspect of marketing? Social media? Analytics? Strategy?"

---

## Part 2: SDL Step 1 - Assess Readiness (15 minutes)

### Facilitation Guidance

**Key message:** "Before investing time in learning something, assess whether you're READY. This prevents wasted effort."

**Instructions:**
1. "Answer the four readiness questions in Part 2 of your handout."
2. "Be brutally honest—especially about motivation and resources."
3. "If you discover you're NOT ready (missing prerequisites, no resources), choose a different skill OR plan a 'pre-learning phase' to address gaps."

### Walk Around & Check For

**Knowledge Assessment Quality:**
- Are students SPECIFIC about what they know? (Good: "I can create basic bar charts in Excel." Bad: "I know some Excel.")
- Are they identifying actual prerequisites? (Good: "I need to understand what 'statistical significance' means before learning data analysis." Bad: "I don't know what I need to know.")

**Motivation Assessment Quality:**
- Do they articulate WHY this skill matters for career goals?
- Is the motivation intrinsic (skill supports their values/interests) or purely extrinsic (job postings require it)? Both are valid, but extrinsic-only motivation tends to fade.

**Resource Assessment Quality:**
- Are they identifying SPECIFIC resources? (Good: "LinkedIn Learning subscription through university, 'Storytelling with Data' book from library, mentor has data viz expertise." Bad: "The internet.")
- Have they thought about costs? Time requirements?

### Common Student Issues & Interventions

**Issue:** Student discovers they're missing critical prerequisites
**Intervention:** "That's great self-awareness! You have two options: (1) Choose a more foundational skill for this contract (e.g., if Python is too advanced, start with Excel), OR (2) Make your contract a two-phase plan—Phase 1: Build prerequisites (Weeks 1-4), Phase 2: Main skill development (Weeks 5-12)."

**Issue:** Student has weak motivation ("I should learn this but don't really care")
**Intervention:** "Be honest with yourself. If the motivation isn't there, this contract will fail. Either: (1) Find the connection to something you DO care about (How does this skill support your actual career vision?), OR (2) Choose a different skill you're genuinely motivated to learn."

**Issue:** Student identifies zero resources
**Intervention:** "Spend 5 minutes Googling. Find one specific online course, one YouTube channel, one textbook, one person who could mentor you. If you truly can't find ANY resources, this might not be a feasible skill right now."

---

## Part 3: Learning Contract Creation (25 minutes)

### Facilitation Guidance

**Key message:** "The learning contract is your blueprint. Someone else should be able to pick this up and know EXACTLY what you're doing, how, when, and how success is measured."

**Instructions:**
1. "Complete all 8 fields of the learning contract template in Part 3."
2. "Focus on specificity—numbers, dates, measurable outcomes."
3. "Your timeline should apply spacing principles—spread learning over weeks, not cram into weekends."

### Walk Around & Provide Formative Feedback

**Check each field for quality:**

**1. Learning Goal (single sentence)**
- Good: "Develop intermediate data visualization skills using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries"
- Weak: "Learn Python" (too broad—Python for what? Web dev? Data science? Automation?)
- Weak: "Improve my technical skills" (not specific enough)

**2. Why This Matters**
- Good: "Data storytelling is essential for business analyst roles; visualizations will strengthen my internship applications and help me stand out"
- Weak: "It seems useful" (lacks connection to career goals)
- Weak: "Job postings require it" (purely extrinsic—okay but probe for intrinsic motivation too)

**3. Current Level**
- Good: "Beginner—I can create basic charts in Excel but have never used Python for visualization or written any Python code"
- Weak: "I'm not very good" (not specific enough to measure progress)
- Good honesty indicator: Students who rate themselves 1-2/5 are often being realistic; students who rate themselves 4/5 but have no evidence may be overconfident

**4. Target Level**
- Good: "Intermediate—create professional multi-chart dashboards with customized colors/labels/layouts, present data insights clearly, choose appropriate chart types for different data"
- Weak: "Become really good at it" (not measurable)
- Check: Is the gap between current and target reasonable for the timeline? (Beginner to Expert in 4 weeks = unrealistic)

**5. Learning Strategies (minimum 3)**
- Good diversity: "Complete DataCamp course (structured learning) + work through 10 Kaggle datasets (practice) + recreate 5 charts from The Economist (imitation of excellence)"
- Weak: Single strategy only ("Watch YouTube videos")
- Check: Do strategies include ACTIVE learning (practice, creation, teaching) or only PASSIVE consumption (watching, reading)?

**6. Resources Needed**
- Good: "DataCamp subscription ($25/month), Python installed (free), 'Storytelling with Data' book (library), mentor feedback"
- Weak: "Online tutorials" (not specific enough)
- Check: Do they have realistic access to these resources? Have they addressed costs?

**7. Timeline with Phases**
- Good: "6 weeks total: Weeks 1-2 (Matplotlib basics—bar charts, line plots, scatter plots), Weeks 3-4 (Seaborn intermediate—heatmaps, multi-chart layouts), Weeks 5-6 (3 portfolio projects)"
- Weak: "I'll work on it when I have time" (no structure)
- Check: Does the timeline apply SPACING (distributed over time) or CRAMMING (everything in 1-2 intensive periods)?

**8. Success Evidence (minimum 3 pieces)**
- Good: "Portfolio of 5 publication-quality visualizations + positive mentor feedback on design choices + successfully use Python viz in Marketing Analytics group project"
- Weak: "Finish the DataCamp course" (completion ≠ mastery)
- Weak: "Feel more confident" (not observable/measurable)
- Check: Does evidence demonstrate PERFORMANCE (can you DO it?) or just EXPOSURE (did you watch/read about it)?

### Common Student Questions & Responses

**Q: "How do I know if my timeline is realistic?"**
A: "Ask yourself: How many hours per week can I dedicate? Multiply by number of weeks. Is that enough practice time? Also, check online—how long do courses/certifications in this skill typically take? If unclear, discuss with your mentor."

**Q: "What if I don't have a mentor who knows this skill?"**
A: "Resources beyond your assigned mentor: (1) Instructors in relevant courses, (2) Alumni working in that field (NEU career services can connect you), (3) Online communities (Reddit, Stack Overflow, industry forums), (4) Peers who already have the skill."

**Q: "Can my success evidence just be 'complete the course'?"**
A: "That can be PART of your evidence, but not ALL of it. Completion shows you consumed content, not that you can apply it. Add: 'Create 3 projects using the skill' or 'Teach the concept to a peer' or 'Use it in a real-world context (internship, group project, freelance work).'"

## Part 4: Learning Approach Design (20 minutes)

### Facilitation Guidance

**Key message:** "Now that you have WHAT you'll learn, design HOW you'll learn it using evidence-based strategies from today's lecture."

**Instructions:**
1. "Identify which evidence-based strategies you'll use: retrieval practice, spacing, elaboration, self-explanation, interleaving, teaching others."
2. "Plan how you'll apply Zimmerman's SRL cycle—what does forethought, performance, self-reflection look like for this learning goal?"
3. "Identify obstacles and mitigation strategies—what might go wrong, and how will you prevent/overcome it?"

### Walk Around & Provide Formative Feedback

**1. Evidence-Based Strategies Application**

Look for SPECIFIC plans, not vague intentions:

- Retrieval Practice: "After each DataCamp module, close the platform and try to write code from memory. Check after 10 minutes."
- Spacing: "Study 1 hour Monday, 1 hour Wednesday, 1 hour Friday for 6 weeks—not 18 hours crammed into one weekend."
- Teaching Others: "Every Friday, explain this week's concept to my roommate using only a whiteboard—no notes."
- Elaboration: "After learning each chart type, ask: Why would I use this instead of alternatives? When would this mislead viewers?"

**Common weakness:** Students list the strategies but don't explain HOW they'll use them.
**Intervention:** "You checked 'retrieval practice'—great. Now tell me: When specifically will you test yourself? What will you do—practice problems, flashcards, teaching aloud?"

**2. SRL Cycle Application**

Check that students plan all three phases:

- **Forethought:** "Before each study session: Set specific goal for that session, choose which strategy (DataCamp vs. Kaggle practice vs. portfolio project), prime self-efficacy ('I struggled yesterday but I can figure this out')"
- **Performance:** "During session: Pomodoro timer (25-min blocks), track which concepts I struggle with, if stuck >15 min consult Stack Overflow or mentor"
- **Self-Reflection:** "After session: Can I explain today's concept without notes? What worked (visual flowcharts)? What didn't (passive video watching)? Adjust next session accordingly."

**Common weakness:** Students skip self-reflection or make it vague ("think about what I learned").
**Intervention:** "Self-reflection needs structure. What specific questions will you ask yourself? How will you test if you learned it? What will you adjust based on the evaluation?"

**3. Obstacles & Mitigation**

Strong students anticipate realistic obstacles:

- "Lose motivation after Week 2" → "Schedule accountability check-ins with study partner every Friday; track progress visually on chart"
- "Procrastinate on practice projects" → "Schedule project time in calendar like appointments; work in library (environmental commitment)"
- "Get stuck and give up" → "Join Stack Overflow, Reddit data viz community; schedule 'office hours' with mentor/instructor for help"

**Common weakness:** Students list obstacles but no mitigation, or they list only external obstacles ("professor assigns too much work").
**Intervention:** "You identified a real obstacle. Now: What's ONE thing you can do to prevent or overcome it? Make it an action YOU control, not something you hope others will do."

---

## Part 5: Peer Review & Refinement (15 minutes)

### Facilitation Guidance

**Structure:**
1. Pair students up (or groups of 3 if odd number)
2. Students exchange learning contracts
3. Each student reviews their partner's contract using the checklist in handout
4. Provide 2-3 specific suggestions

**Instructions:**
"You're quality-checking each other's contracts. Use the peer review checklist. Look for:
- Specificity vs. vagueness
- Realistic timeline
- Success evidence that demonstrates mastery
- Use of evidence-based strategies

Provide at least 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions. NOT 'this is good'—that's not helpful. Find ways to make it stronger."

### Walk Around & Listen

**What to listen for (these indicate effective peer review):**

- "Your target level is clear, but your success evidence is just 'finish the course.' Can you add a project that demonstrates you can actually DO it?"
- "Your timeline seems aggressive—beginner to advanced in 4 weeks for a complex skill. Consider making target 'intermediate' or extending to 8 weeks."
- "You said you'll use retrieval practice, but I don't see where you'll actually test yourself. Can you add weekly self-quizzes?"
- "Your resources section just says 'online courses'—which specific one? Can you research and add the actual course name?"

**What to redirect (these are weak peer feedback):**

- "This looks good!" → "What specifically is strong? And what's one thing that could be improved?"
- "I don't understand your goal" → "Can you help them make it more specific? What questions would you ask to clarify?"
- Students just agreeing with everything → "Your job is to find at least 2-3 ways to strengthen the contract. Push each other to be more specific."

### Common Peer Review Patterns

**Pattern 1: Students are too nice ("everything is perfect!")**
**Intervention:** "Remember, you're helping your partner create something they'll use for months. Be a critical friend. Find 2 things that could be clearer, more specific, or more realistic."

**Pattern 2: Students focus only on grammar/formatting**
**Intervention:** "Formatting is fine. Focus on CONTENT: Are the goals specific enough? Is the timeline realistic? Will the success evidence actually prove mastery?"

**Pattern 3: One student dominates feedback time**
**Intervention:** "Make sure you're balancing time—each person should get equal feedback. Set a timer if needed."

---

## Part 6: Reflection & Next Steps (10 minutes)

### Facilitation Guidance

**Instructions:**
"Take the final 10 minutes to reflect and plan your next steps."

**Four reflection questions (in handout):**
1. How does this learning contract connect to your Personal Development Plan?
2. What's the FIRST action you'll take this week?
3. How will you share this with your mentor?
4. What did you learn about self-managed learning today?

**Check that students:**
- Identify specific PDP sections this supports (Part 2: Skills Gap Analysis, Part 3: SMART Goals if applicable, Part 5: Implementation)
- Name a CONCRETE first action with a timeline ("Tuesday 3-4pm: Install Python and complete first DataCamp module")
- Plan to discuss in specific mentor meeting ("I'll share in Meeting #2 and ask for resource recommendations and timeline feedback")

---

## Assessment & Submission

**What students submit:**
1. Completed Learning Contract (8 fields from Part 3)
2. Learning Approach Plan (Part 4—strategies, obstacles, SRL application)
3. Brief Reflection (Part 6—100-150 words)

**Submission:** Course management system, within 24 hours

**Grading (if graded separately):**
- Completion and specificity of contract fields (50%)
- Application of evidence-based strategies and SRL cycle (30%)
- Quality of reflection and connection to PDP (20%)

**Formative Feedback Points:**
- Provide 1-2 specific comments per contract highlighting strengths and suggesting refinements
- Look for common weaknesses across class (vague goals, weak success evidence, no spacing) and address in next lecture

---

## Common Student Challenges & Interventions

### Challenge 1: "I don't know what skill to choose"

**Symptoms:** Student is still on Part 1 after 20 minutes; hasn't selected a goal

**Intervention:**
"Let's narrow it down. What's your ideal job 3 years from now?" [Student answers]

"Okay, search LinkedIn for 3 job postings in that role. What skills appear in all 3 postings?" [Student identifies common skills]

"Pick ONE of those skills that you don't currently have. That's your learning goal."

**Alternative:** "What did you struggle with in your last group project or assignment that frustrated you? Often our frustrations reveal skill gaps worth addressing."

### Challenge 2: "My timeline is unrealistic but I don't realize it"

**Symptoms:** Contract shows "Learn advanced Python in 2 weeks" or "Become fluent in Spanish in 4 weeks"

**Intervention:**
"Let's reality-check this. How many hours per week can you dedicate to this skill?" [Student answers: "Maybe 3 hours"]

"So 3 hours/week × 2 weeks = 6 total hours. Can you go from zero to advanced in 6 hours?" [Student realizes: "Probably not"]

"What's a realistic milestone for 6-8 weeks given your time? Maybe 'beginner to intermediate' or 'complete foundations module'?"

### Challenge 3: "My success evidence is all about completion, not mastery"

**Symptoms:** Evidence fields say "Finish course," "Get certificate," "Read book"

**Intervention:**
"Those show you consumed content. But can you DO the skill afterward? Let's add performance evidence.

What could you CREATE that demonstrates mastery? A project? Portfolio piece? Presentation? Teaching it to someone?

What FEEDBACK could you collect? From your mentor? Peer review? Instructor evaluation?

Where could you APPLY it? Group project? Internship task? Personal project?"

**Prompt student to add:** "Create 3 sample projects" or "Receive 4/5 average rating from mentor on skill demonstration" or "Successfully apply skill in Marketing Analytics group assignment."

### Challenge 4: "I'm choosing a skill just because it's easy, not because I need it"

**Symptoms:** Student picks something they're already good at or something unrelated to career goals

**Intervention:**
"You rated yourself 4/5 current level for Excel—you're already strong there. What skill would stretch you more? What gap, if filled, would have the biggest impact on your career goals or PDP?"

**Alternative intervention:** "This skill (photography hobby) seems fun, but how does it connect to your career vision (becoming an accountant)? Is there a more strategic skill that supports your 3-year goals?"

**Clarify:** "You CAN choose a personal interest skill, but your PDP is career-focused. For today's contract, prioritize a skill that supports your professional development."

### Challenge 5: "I'm trying to learn too many things in one contract"

**Symptoms:** Contract lists 5-7 different skills or a single massive skill ("become a full-stack developer")

**Intervention:**
"Learning contracts work best when focused on ONE specific, achievable skill. You've listed: Python, Excel, R, PowerBI, and SQL. Pick the MOST important one for this contract.

Once you master that, create another contract for the next skill. Don't try to learn everything simultaneously—you'll spread yourself too thin and master nothing."

---

## Extension Activities (For Students Who Finish Early)

**Option 1: Create a Visual Learning Timeline**
"Use any tool (hand-drawn, Excel, Canva, timeline software) to visualize your 6-12 week learning journey: phases, milestones, checkpoints, self-testing moments, portfolio projects. This can become part of your PDP."

**Option 2: Research Resources & Create Annotated Bibliography**
"Find 5 high-quality resources for your skill (courses, books, YouTube channels, forums, mentors). For each, write 2-3 sentences: What it covers, why it's valuable, when you'll use it."

**Option 3: Draft Mentor Meeting #2 Questions**
"Based on your learning contract, write 5 questions you'll ask your mentor in Meeting #2:
- Resource recommendations?
- Timeline feedback?
- How did they develop this skill?
- Common mistakes to avoid?
- Who else can help?"

---

## Closing (Final 5 minutes)

**Invite 2-3 volunteers to share their learning contract (30 seconds each):**

"Who wants to share their learning goal and one specific strategy you'll use?"

**Listen for variety:** Try to get mix of technical skills, soft skills, and different evidence-based strategies

**After each share, affirm:** "Great—I love how specific your success evidence is" or "That's a smart obstacle mitigation plan" or "Your timeline applies spacing well."

**Final message:**
"You now have a professional-grade learning contract. This isn't homework you'll forget about—this is a tool you'll use:
- THIS WEEK when you meet with your mentor
- NEXT MONTH in your PDP submission
- FOR YEARS whenever you need to teach yourself something new

The ability to strategically teach yourself anything is the ultimate career superpower in the AI era. You just practiced that superpower."

**Remind about submission:**
"Submit your completed contract to [course management system] within 24 hours. Bring a copy to your next mentor meeting."
