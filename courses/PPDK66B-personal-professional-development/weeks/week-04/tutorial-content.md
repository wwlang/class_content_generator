# Week 4 Tutorial: Learning Strategy Audit & Learning Contract Development

**Course:** PPDK66B Personal & Professional Development
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Directly prepares for Mentor Meeting #2 (learning goals discussion) — supports PDP Section 4 (learning strategies and monitoring), and builds metacognitive awareness for Reflective Essay analysis. Aligns with LO4: Implement self-managed learning strategies including metacognitive monitoring, strategic goal-setting, and adaptive adjustment techniques.

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**
- **Zimmerman's Cyclical Phase Model:** Forethought (goal-setting, planning) → Performance (self-control, self-observation) → Self-Reflection (self-judgment, self-reaction) → cycle repeats
- **Waterloo's SDL Framework:** Assess readiness → Set learning goals → Engage in learning → Evaluate learning (creates structured autonomy)
- **Learning Styles Myth:** The meshing hypothesis (matching instruction to VARK/Kolb style) has no empirical support; content determines optimal modality, not learner preference
- **Evidence-Based Strategies:** Retrieval practice (HIGH), spaced practice (HIGH), elaboration (MODERATE), interleaving (MODERATE) — these work for all learners

**What good work looks like:**
- Honest identification of ineffective study habits (not defensive rationalization)
- Specific, measurable learning goals with clear evidence criteria
- Actionable learning contracts that include evidence-based strategies
- Commitment to replacing low-evidence techniques (highlighting, rereading) with high-evidence techniques (retrieval, spacing)

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Mentorship Program Rubric (20%) — Pre-Meeting Preparation Forms are assessed on quality of preparation, specificity of questions, and evidence of self-directed learning. Today's learning contract becomes the foundation for Meeting #2 preparation.

## Main Activity: Learning Strategy Audit & Learning Contract Creation

**Assessment Connection:** This activity directly prepares you for THREE assessments:

1. **Mentor Meeting #2 (Part of 20%):** Your Pre-Meeting Form (due 48 hours before meeting) requires a draft learning contract and discussion questions about self-directed learning. Today's work IS that draft.

2. **Personal Development Plan (40%):** Section 4 requires you to describe your learning strategies, monitoring approaches, and how you'll track progress toward goals. Your learning contract template provides this structure.

3. **Reflective Essay (10%):** Metacognitive awareness (knowing HOW you learn) deepens your analysis of the field trip and guest speaker experiences. Today's audit reveals your learning patterns.

**The Task:**
Complete two interconnected exercises:
1. **Learning Strategy Audit** - Evaluate your current study habits against evidence-based practices
2. **Learning Contract** - Create a structured plan for ONE PDP-related skill using the Waterloo framework

**Deliverable:**
A 2-page document containing:
- Part 1: Learning Strategy Audit (identify what you're doing, what works, what doesn't)
- Part 2: Learning Contract for ONE skill development goal (WHAT, HOW, WHEN, EVIDENCE)

**Success Criteria:**
- Audit shows honest assessment of current habits with specific examples (not vague claims)
- Learning contract is specific and measurable (could hand to someone else and they'd know exactly what to do)
- Strategies section includes at least TWO evidence-based techniques from today's lecture
- Timeline is realistic with concrete milestones (not "work hard every day")

## Part 1: Learning Strategy Audit (30 minutes)

### Instructions

**Step 1: Current Habits Inventory (10 min - Individual Work)**

For each category below, rate yourself honestly (1-5 scale) and provide specific evidence:

**A. Retrieval Practice**
- **How often do you test yourself BEFORE exams?**
  - 1 = Never, I only reread notes
  - 5 = I actively quiz myself after every study session
- **Rating: ___/5**
- **Specific Evidence:** (e.g., "Last week I studied for the Quiz 3 by reading slides 4 times but never tested myself" or "I use Quizlet flashcards for vocabulary weekly")

**B. Spaced Practice**
- **How do you distribute study time?**
  - 1 = I cram the night before tests
  - 5 = I start studying 2+ weeks early with daily sessions
- **Rating: ___/5**
- **Specific Evidence:**

**C. Elaboration**
- **How deeply do you process information?**
  - 1 = I memorize definitions without understanding connections
  - 5 = I constantly ask "why/how" and connect to real examples
- **Rating: ___/5**
- **Specific Evidence:**

**D. Active vs. Passive Strategies**
- **What percentage of study time is ACTIVE (writing, speaking, practicing) vs. PASSIVE (reading, highlighting)?**
  - 1 = 90%+ passive
  - 5 = 90%+ active
- **Rating: ___/5**
- **Specific Evidence:**

**E. Metacognitive Monitoring**
- **How accurately do you judge your understanding?**
  - 1 = I often think I know something, then fail the test
  - 5 = I can accurately predict which questions I'll get right/wrong
- **Rating: ___/5**
- **Specific Evidence:**

**Step 2: Identify Your Weakest Phase in Zimmerman's Model (5 min - Individual Reflection)**

Review Zimmerman's three phases. Which is YOUR weakest?

**Forethought Phase (Planning BEFORE learning):**
- [ ] I rarely set specific learning goals before studying
- [ ] I don't plan HOW I'll study, I just "start studying"
- [ ] I lack confidence in my ability to learn difficult material (low self-efficacy)

**Performance Phase (Execution DURING learning):**
- [ ] I get easily distracted (phone, social media, environment)
- [ ] I use ineffective strategies (passive reading, highlighting)
- [ ] I don't monitor whether I'm understanding as I go

**Self-Reflection Phase (Evaluation AFTER learning):**
- [ ] I don't review what I learned or didn't learn after study sessions
- [ ] When I do poorly, I blame external factors (teacher, test difficulty) instead of my strategies
- [ ] I don't adjust my approach based on results

**My Weakest Phase:** ___________________

**Why this phase is weak (specific example):**
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

**Step 3: Identify ONE Ineffective Habit to Replace (5 min - Individual)**

Look at your audit. Pick ONE specific habit that's holding you back.

**Ineffective Habit I Will STOP:**
_________________________________________________________

**Evidence-Based Strategy I Will START (choose from lecture):**
- [ ] Retrieval Practice (self-testing, flashcards, explaining without notes)
- [ ] Spaced Practice (study plan spread over 2+ weeks)
- [ ] Elaboration (ask why/how, connect to examples)
- [ ] Interleaving (mix topics during practice)

**My Replacement Strategy:**
_________________________________________________________

**How I'll implement it THIS WEEK (be specific):**
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

---

**Step 4: Pair Share (10 min - Pairs)**

Partner with someone near you. Each person shares (4 min each):
1. Your lowest-rated category from the audit (what's your biggest gap?)
2. Your weakest Zimmerman phase (forethought/performance/self-reflection)
3. The ONE habit you're going to replace this week

**Pair Feedback:**
- Does your partner's replacement strategy align with their gap?
- Is the implementation plan specific enough?
- What's one suggestion to make it more concrete?

**Partner's Name:** ___________________
**Their Suggestion:**
_________________________________________________________

**Step 4: Quality Check Against Evidence-Based Criteria (5 min - Individual)**

Review your learning contract. Does it include:

**Specificity Check:**
- [ ] Learning goal is concrete (not vague)
- [ ] Activities include specific actions (not "study more")
- [ ] Timeline has actual dates (not "soon")
- [ ] Evidence criteria are measurable (can objectively check if achieved)

**Evidence-Based Strategies Check:**
- [ ] I've included at least TWO high-evidence strategies (retrieval/spacing/elaboration/interleaving)
- [ ] I'm doing ACTIVE practice, not just passive reading/watching
- [ ] I've planned for spaced practice (distributed over time, not crammed)

**Realistic Feasibility Check:**
- [ ] Time commitment is realistic given my other courses/commitments
- [ ] Target improvement is achievable in 4-8 weeks (not "become expert overnight")
- [ ] I have access to needed resources
- [ ] I've identified accountability partners

**Zimmerman Alignment Check:**
- [ ] **Forethought:** I've set specific goals and planned strategies
- [ ] **Performance:** I've described what I'll DO during learning
- [ ] **Self-Reflection:** I've built in progress checks and evaluation criteria

**If you answered NO to any item, revise your learning contract before moving to next step.**

**Step 5: Peer Review (10 min - Small Groups of 3)**

Share your learning contract with 2 peers. Each person presents (2 min), then receives feedback (1 min).

**When You Present:**
- Explain WHAT you're learning and WHY (career connection)
- Describe HOW you'll learn it (highlight evidence-based strategies)
- Share your biggest concern or question

**When You Give Feedback:**
- Is the goal specific enough? (or still too vague?)
- Are the strategies ACTIVE or PASSIVE?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- What's ONE suggestion to strengthen it?

**Feedback Received from Peer 1 (Name: ______________):**
_________________________________________________________

## Key Takeaways

**From Today's Tutorial:**

1. **Most students use LOW-EVIDENCE strategies** (highlighting, rereading, cramming) because they feel easy—but evidence-based strategies (retrieval, spacing, elaboration) are far more effective

2. **Learning contracts transform vague intentions into concrete plans** - specificity is everything (WHAT, HOW, WHEN, EVIDENCE)

3. **Self-regulated learning is a teachable skill** - Zimmerman's cycle (forethought → performance → self-reflection) applies to all learning contexts

4. **Your weakest Zimmerman phase is your growth opportunity** - identify it, strengthen it, improve all learning outcomes

5. **Mentor Meeting #2 is about refinement, not creation** - bring a DRAFT learning contract for discussion, not a blank page

**Remember:** The evidence-based strategies feel HARDER at first (desirable difficulty)—that struggle is what strengthens memory and understanding. Embrace it.

---

**Questions? Concerns? Confusion?**

- Attend office hours this week if you need help refining your learning contract
- Bring draft to Mentor Meeting #2 preparation—your mentor will provide expert guidance
- Use the tutorial Slack/discussion board to share resources and tips with classmates

**Good luck! See you Week 5 for self-assessment deep dive!**
