# Week 4 Tutorial: Self-Managed Learning in Action

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Mentorship Program (20%) and Personal Development Plan (40%) - this activity practices creating learning contracts and applying self-regulated learning frameworks essential for both assessments.

---

## Quick Review (5 minutes)

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Zimmerman's Three-Phase SRL Model:** (1) Forethought Phase (goal setting, strategic planning, self-efficacy beliefs), (2) Performance Phase (self-control strategies, self-observation), (3) Self-Reflection Phase (self-judgment, self-reaction). The cycle repeats continuously—learning from each iteration.

- **Waterloo's Four-Step SDL Process:** (1) Assess Readiness to Learn (attitudes, abilities, characteristics), (2) Set Learning Goals (learning contracts with goals, strategies, evidence, timeline), (3) Engage in Learning Process (identify resources, select strategies, monitor progress), (4) Evaluate Learning (self-reflection and external feedback).

- **Evidence-Based Learning Strategies (HIGH effectiveness):** (1) Retrieval Practice—actively recalling information from memory strengthens retention more than rereading, (2) Spaced Practice—distributing study over time beats cramming. (MODERATE effectiveness): Elaboration (asking why/how, connecting to prior knowledge), Interleaving (mixing topics during study).

- **Learning Styles Myth:** No evidence supports matching instruction to learning styles (VARK, Kolb). You have learning preferences (comfort), not learning styles (effectiveness). Use evidence-based strategies instead.

**What good work looks like:**
- Learning contracts with specific, measurable goals and clear evidence criteria
- Realistic strategies using multiple resources (mentors, research, practice opportunities)
- Honest self-assessment identifying strengths and development needs
- Evidence-based learning strategies chosen based on research, not comfort

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Section 2 (Mentorship Program) and Section 3 (Personal Development Plan)

## Main Activity: Learning Contract Design Workshop (75 minutes)

**Assessment Connection:** Personal Development Plan (40%) and Mentorship Program (20%) - learning contracts are core components of your PDP SMART goals and mentorship preparation. This activity practices the exact format required for both assessments.

**The Task:**
Create three comprehensive learning contracts for goals you're considering for your Personal Development Plan. Each contract must follow the four-element format from today's lecture and integrate self-regulated learning principles.

**Deliverable:**
- Three completed learning contracts (one professional skill, one academic competency, one personal development area)
- Written reflection (300 words) connecting learning contracts to Zimmerman's SRL cycle and evidence-based strategies
- Peer feedback received and given (documented on feedback form)

**Success Criteria:** (from PDP Rubric)
- Goals are specific, measurable, and aligned with self-assessment insights
- Strategies include multiple resources and evidence-based learning approaches
- Evidence criteria are clear and measurable (you'll know definitively if achieved)
- Timelines are realistic and include milestone checkpoints
- Demonstrates metacognitive awareness of learning processes

### Activity Structure

**Phase 1: Individual Draft (20 minutes)**

Create three learning contracts using the template below. Choose goals from different development areas:

1. **Professional Skill:** e.g., "Develop data analytics capabilities for business decision-making"
2. **Academic Competency:** e.g., "Master academic writing at university standard"
3. **Personal Development:** e.g., "Build confidence in public speaking and presentations"

**Learning Contract Template:**

```
GOAL: [What specifically will I learn/develop?]
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

STRATEGIES & RESOURCES: [How will I learn it? Must include 3+ approaches]
1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

EVIDENCE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT: [How will I know I've achieved it? Must be measurable]
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

TIMELINE: [By when? Include checkpoint milestones]

**Guidance for Each Contract Element:**

**GOAL - Must be SMART:**
- **Specific:** Not "improve communication," but "develop ability to deliver confident 10-minute professional presentations with Q&A"
- **Measurable:** Include quantifiable indicators ("present 8 times," "feedback scores average 4+/5")
- **Achievable:** Realistic given your starting point and available time
- **Relevant:** Aligned with career goals and self-assessment insights (MBTI, VIA, Holland Code)
- **Time-bound:** Clear deadline with interim checkpoints

**STRATEGIES & RESOURCES - Minimum 3, diverse types:**
- **Human resources:** Mentor meetings, peer practice groups, professional role models, instructor feedback
- **Experiential resources:** Join clubs/organizations, volunteer for presentations, seek practice opportunities
- **Information resources:** Online courses (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera), books, articles, video tutorials
- **Practice/Application:** Regular scheduled practice, real-world application opportunities

**Pro tip:** Include at least one strategy involving your mentor—this strengthens Mentorship Program alignment.

**EVIDENCE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT - Must be objectively assessable:**
- **Quantitative indicators:** "Complete 10 practice presentations," "Pass Excel certification exam"
- **Performance standards:** "Deliver presentation receiving average feedback score of 4+/5 from 3 evaluators"
- **Product demonstrations:** "Create portfolio of 5 data visualizations demonstrating analytics capabilities"
- **Third-party validation:** "Mentor confirms competency development," "Instructor assesses writing as meeting university standard"

**Avoid vague evidence:** "Feel more confident," "Understand better," "Improve skills"—these aren't measurable.

**TIMELINE - Work backwards from PDP deadline:**
- Your PDP is due Week 11 (November 28, 2025)
- For 1-year goals: completion by May-August 2026
- Include quarterly checkpoints: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- Build in buffer time for setbacks

**SRL APPLICATION - Connect to Zimmerman's model:**
- **Forethought strategies:** "Before each practice session, I'll set specific improvement goal based on previous feedback"
- **Performance monitoring:** "During practice, I'll record myself and self-assess using rubric; track progress in learning journal"
- **Self-reflection:** "After each presentation, I'll complete reflection using Gibbs' Cycle within 24 hours; monthly review with mentor"

**EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES - Choose appropriate ones:**
- **Retrieval Practice for presentations:** Practice without notes, teach concepts to others, self-quiz on content
- **Spaced Practice for skill development:** Distribute practice sessions (weekly presentations rather than cramming before assessment)
- **Elaboration for understanding:** Connect new presentation techniques to successful examples I've observed; explain why techniques work
- **Interleaving for complex skills:** Mix different aspects (content development, delivery, visual design) rather than mastering one then moving to next

**Phase 2: Peer Review & Feedback (30 minutes)**

**Groups of 3 students - Rotate roles:**

**Round 1 (10 min): Student A presents → Students B & C give feedback**
**Round 2 (10 min): Student B presents → Students A & C give feedback**
**Round 3 (10 min): Student C presents → Students A & B give feedback**

**As Presenter:**
- Share one learning contract (choose your strongest one)
- Explain your goal, why it matters for your development, and how strategies connect to SRL

**As Peer Reviewer - Use this feedback framework:**

**1. GOAL CLARITY (Is it SMART?):**
- ✅ Strengths: What's clear and measurable about this goal?
- 🔍 Questions: What needs more specificity? Is the scope realistic?
- 💡 Suggestions: How could this be more measurable/specific?

**2. STRATEGY DIVERSITY (Are resources varied and evidence-based?):**
- ✅ Strengths: Which strategies are particularly strong?
- 🔍 Questions: Are strategies appropriate for the goal? Are evidence-based learning principles incorporated?
- 💡 Suggestions: What additional resources could strengthen this? Are mentor interactions included?

**3. EVIDENCE QUALITY (Can achievement be objectively assessed?):**
- ✅ Strengths: What's measurable about the evidence criteria?
- 🔍 Questions: Could someone else assess whether goal was achieved using these criteria?
- 💡 Suggestions: How could evidence be more concrete/observable?

**4. SRL INTEGRATION (Are self-regulated learning principles applied?):**
- ✅ Strengths: How does this learning contract demonstrate metacognitive awareness?
- 🔍 Questions: Are all three SRL phases addressed? Are monitoring approaches specific?
- 💡 Suggestions: What self-regulation strategies could enhance this plan?

**Document feedback on peer review form—you'll submit this with your contracts.**

---

**Phase 3: Revision & Reflection (25 minutes)**

**Individual Work:**

**Step 1: Revise learning contracts (15 minutes)**
- Incorporate peer feedback—strengthen specificity, add strategies, clarify evidence
- Ensure all three contracts demonstrate distinct development areas
- Check that mentor integration appears in at least two contracts

**Step 2: Write reflection (10 minutes - 300 words)**

Address these prompts:

**Paragraph 1 (100 words): Self-Regulated Learning Application**
- How do your learning contracts incorporate Zimmerman's three-phase cycle?
- Which SRL phase do you find easiest to apply? Which is most challenging? Why?
- Give one specific example of how you'll use self-observation during the performance phase.

**Paragraph 2 (100 words): Evidence-Based Strategies**
- Which evidence-based learning strategies will you use most frequently? Why those specifically?
- Give one concrete example of how you'll apply retrieval practice or spaced practice to one of your goals.
- Why are these strategies more effective than passive approaches (rereading, highlighting) for your development?

**Paragraph 3 (100 words): Metacognitive Awareness**
- What did you learn about your learning through creating these contracts?
- Where did you struggle most in this activity? What does that reveal about your current SDL readiness?
- How will you monitor your metacognitive accuracy (knowing what you actually know vs. what you think you know) as you work toward these goals?

## Tutorial Closing & Next Steps (10 minutes)

**Tutor-Led Discussion Questions:**

1. **Connection to Mentorship:** How will learning contracts structure your mentorship preparation and follow-up? What's one way you'll use this format before your next meeting?

2. **PDP Integration:** Your Personal Development Plan requires SMART goals with action plans. How do today's learning contracts translate directly to your PDP requirements?

3. **Evidence-Based Learning:** What's ONE evidence-based strategy you'll implement in ALL your courses starting this week? How will you track whether it improves your learning?

4. **Metacognitive Insight:** What surprised you about designing learning contracts? Was it easier or harder than expected? What does that tell you about your current self-directed learning capabilities?

## Optional Extension: Self-Assessment Tools

**For students who want deeper self-knowledge to inform learning contracts:**

**Assess your SDL Readiness:**
- **Attitudes:** Rate 1-5: How curious are you about learning new things? How motivated to take initiative?
- **Abilities:** Rate 1-5: How strong are your time management skills? Learning strategy knowledge? Information literacy?
- **Characteristics:** Rate 1-5: How self-disciplined? Persistent when challenged? Comfortable with ambiguity?

**Low scores (1-2):** You need more structure—use mentor meetings frequently, schedule regular check-ins, create detailed action plans with short intervals.

**Medium scores (3):** You can self-direct with periodic support—monthly mentor check-ins, milestone reviews, peer accountability partners.

**High scores (4-5):** You can operate more independently—use mentors for strategic guidance, seek feedback at key milestones, adjust plans autonomously.

**This assessment informs HOW MUCH scaffolding your learning contracts should include.**
