## Part 1: Selecting Your Learning Goal (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Review Your Preliminary PDP Goals

Think about the skills or knowledge areas you want to develop for your career. Consider:

- **Technical/Hard Skills:** Excel, Python, data analysis, graphic design, video editing, financial modeling, etc.
- **Transferable/Soft Skills:** Public speaking, leadership, negotiation, time management, writing, etc.
- **AI-Era Skills:** Prompt engineering, AI tool mastery, critical evaluation of AI outputs, human-AI collaboration
- **Domain Knowledge:** Industry-specific knowledge (marketing frameworks, accounting principles, supply chain, etc.)

### Step 2: Choose ONE Skill for Today's Contract

**Selection Criteria:**

1. **Relevance:** This skill should support your 1-year or 3-year career goals
2. **Feasibility:** You can make meaningful progress in 4-12 weeks
3. **Measurability:** You can define clear "before" and "after" levels
4. **Resources Available:** You have access to learning materials, tools, or mentors

**Write your chosen skill here:**

```
My chosen skill: _________________________________________________
```

### Step 3: Quick Self-Assessment

Before creating your learning contract, assess your current relationship with this skill:

**Current Level (1-5 scale):**
- 1 = No knowledge/experience
- 2 = Beginner (basic familiarity)
- 3 = Intermediate (can perform with guidance)
- 4 = Advanced (can perform independently)
- 5 = Expert (can teach others)

**My current level: _____ / 5**

**Why I want to develop this skill (2-3 sentences):**

## Part 2: SDL Step 1 - Assess Readiness to Learn (15 minutes)

Answer these questions honestly to evaluate your readiness:

### Knowledge Assessment

**1. What do I already know about this skill/topic?**

(List specific knowledge, experiences, or related skills you already have)

```
Example: "I know basic Excel formulas (SUM, AVERAGE) from high school. I've created
simple charts for class presentations. I understand the concept of spreadsheets
but have never used pivot tables or macros."
```

Your answer:

---

**2. What foundational knowledge or prerequisites do I need?**

(Identify any gaps that might prevent you from learning effectively)

```
Example: "I need basic understanding of data types (numbers, text, dates). I should
understand what 'data analysis' means conceptually before diving into advanced Excel."
```

Your answer:

---

### Motivation Assessment

**3. Why am I motivated to learn this? What outcomes do I expect?**

(Be specific about how this supports your career goals)

```
Example: "70% of business analyst job postings require advanced Excel skills. Learning
this will make me more competitive for summer internships. I expect to analyze datasets
faster and create professional-looking reports that impress employers."
```

Your answer:

---

### Resource Assessment

**4. What resources are available to me?**

Check all that apply and identify specific resources:

- [ ] **University resources:** _____________________________________________
- [ ] **Online courses/platforms:** _____________________________________________
- [ ] **Books/textbooks:** _____________________________________________
- [ ] **Mentors/experts I can ask:** _____________________________________________
- [ ] **Software/tools/equipment:** _____________________________________________
- [ ] **Peers/study groups:** _____________________________________________
- [ ] **Financial resources (if needed):** _____________________________________________

### Readiness Verdict

Based on your answers above, rate your readiness to learn this skill:

- [ ] **High Readiness:** I have prerequisite knowledge, strong motivation, and good resources
- [ ] **Moderate Readiness:** I'm missing 1-2 elements but can address gaps quickly
- [ ] **Low Readiness:** I need to build foundations first or find better resources

**If Low Readiness:** Consider choosing a different skill for this contract, or plan a "pre-learning" phase to build prerequisites.

## Part 3: SDL Step 2 - Set Learning Goals (25 minutes)

### Define Your Target Level

**In 4-12 weeks, what specific level do you want to reach?**

Be concrete. Instead of "I want to be good at Excel," specify:

```
Example: "I want to independently create pivot tables to analyze sales data,
use VLOOKUP to merge datasets, apply conditional formatting to highlight trends,
and build interactive dashboards with 5+ charts that tell a data story."
```

Your target level:

---

- **Peer/Expert Feedback:** Who will evaluate your work
- **Performance Evidence:** Tangible demonstrations of mastery

---

## Part 6: Peer Review & Refinement (15 minutes)

### Pair up with a classmate and exchange learning contracts.

**Peer Review Checklist:**

As you review your partner's contract, provide feedback on:

- [ ] **Specificity:** Is the target level specific and measurable, or vague?
  - ❌ Vague: "Get better at public speaking"
  - ✅ Specific: "Deliver 10-minute presentations without notes, with varied vocal tone and natural eye contact"

- [ ] **Feasibility:** Is the timeline realistic given the target level and resources?

- [ ] **Resources:** Are the resources specific enough? Do they need to add any?

- [ ] **Evidence:** Will the success evidence actually demonstrate mastery?
  - ❌ Weak: "Complete the online course" (completion ≠ mastery)
  - ✅ Strong: "Use the skill in 3 real projects; receive positive feedback from mentor"

- [ ] **Evidence-Based Strategies:** Did they incorporate spacing, retrieval practice, or other high-utility strategies?

**Provide 2-3 specific suggestions for improvement:**

1.

## Part 7: Reflection & Next Steps (10 minutes)

### Individual Reflection

**1. How does this learning contract connect to your Personal Development Plan?**

(Which section of your PDP will this support? Skills Gap Analysis? SMART Goals? Implementation Plan?)

---

**2. What's the FIRST action you'll take this week to begin?**

(Be specific—what will you do, when, and for how long?)

---

**3. How will you share this learning contract with your mentor?**

(In which meeting will you discuss it? What feedback will you seek?)

---

**4. What did you learn about self-managed learning today?**

(Reflect on the four-step SDL process—which step was most challenging? Most valuable?)

---

## Deliverables

### Submit to Course Management System:

1. **Completed Learning Contract** (from Part 3)
2. **Learning Approach Plan** (from Part 4—strategies, obstacles, SRL application)
3. **Brief Reflection** (100-150 words on how this connects to your PDP and what you learned today)

**Due:** End of tutorial session (or within 24 hours if instructor allows)

---

## Extension Activity (Optional)

### For those who finish early:

**Create a visual timeline of your learning plan.**

Use any tool you like (hand-drawn, Excel, Canva, Google Slides, timeline software) to visualize:

- Your learning phases over time
- Key milestones and checkpoints
- Self-testing moments (retrieval practice)
- Feedback collection points
- Final demonstration of mastery

This visual can become part of your PDP Implementation & Accountability section (Part 5).

## Tips for Success

1. **Be honest about your current level.** Overestimating helps no one and leads to frustration.

2. **Make success evidence OBSERVABLE.** "I will feel more confident" is not measurable. "I will deliver 3 presentations and receive average rating of 4/5 from peers" is measurable.

3. **Build in accountability.** Learning contracts work best when someone else knows about them. Share yours with your mentor, a study partner, or a friend.

4. **Use this contract in your PDP.** Don't create a learning contract and then forget about it. This should become part of your Personal Development Plan submission.

5. **Review and adjust.** After your first checkpoint (Week 2-3 of learning), evaluate whether your timeline and strategies are working. Adjust if needed—that's the Self-Reflection phase in action!
