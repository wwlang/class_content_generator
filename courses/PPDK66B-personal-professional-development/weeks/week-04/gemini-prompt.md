<instructions>
1. Create a presentation slide deck with exactly 30 slides
2. The first slide in the lecture content IS the title slide - add course name (Personal & Professional Development), university (National Economics University), and campus (IBD Campus) to it
3. Reproduce the exact wording from the lecture content for each slide, preserving all text as written
4. Generate creative visuals for each slide: pictures, infographics, icons, and diagrams that reinforce the slide's message
5. Use a minimum 18pt font for all text. Reference text and footer text is allowed to be smaller
6. Add a footer to every content slide (not the title slide) with: course name, university, topic, and slide number
7. Place academic citations (e.g., Zimmerman, 2002) in the slide footer when referenced in content
8. Leave speaker notes sections empty
9. The final slide is a References slide - format it cleanly with the full APA citations provided

# Self-Managed Learning

**Week 4: Taking Control of Your Learning**

### Slide 2 (Layout: big-number)
# 3x

**Students who use evidence-based learning strategies outperform peers by up to 300%**

Yet most students use ineffective techniques like rereading and highlighting.

*(Dunlosky et al., 2013)*

### Slide 3 (Layout: content)
## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Zimmerman's three-phase model of self-regulated learning to plan, monitor, and evaluate your academic work
2. **Implement** the University of Waterloo's four-step self-directed learning process for structured goal achievement

### Slide 6 (Layout: section-break)
# SEGMENT 1

## Self-Regulated Learning Theory

*The science of taking control of your learning*

### Slide 7 (Layout: framework)
## Self-Regulated Learning Definition

**"The degree to which students are metacognitively, motivationally, and behaviorally active participants in their own learning process."**
*(Zimmerman, 2002)*

**Three key elements:**

1. **Metacognitive:** Awareness and control of thinking processes
2. **Motivational:** Self-efficacy beliefs and goal orientation
3. **Behavioral:** Selecting and using strategies; seeking help when needed

**SRL is cyclical, not linear—continuous adjustment based on feedback.**

### Slide 8 (Layout: framework)
## The Cyclical Phase Model

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   FORETHOUGHT   │──┐
│  Goal Setting   │  │
│   Planning      │  │
└─────────────────┘  │
         ↓           │
┌─────────────────┐  │
│  PERFORMANCE    │  │
│  Self-Control   │  │
│ Self-Observation│  │
└─────────────────┘  │
         ↓           │
┌─────────────────┐  │
│ SELF-REFLECTION │  │
│ Self-Judgment   │  │
│  Self-Reaction  │  │
└─────────────────┘  │
         │           │
         └───────────┘
```

**The cycle repeats continuously—learning from each iteration.**

### Slide 9 (Layout: content)
## Forethought Phase: Before You Start

**Task Analysis:**
- **Goal setting:** Specific, proximal goals (not vague, distant ones)
- **Strategic planning:** Selecting appropriate learning methods

**Self-Motivation Beliefs:**
- **Self-efficacy:** Confidence in your capability to learn this material
- **Outcome expectations:** Belief that effort will lead to desired results
- **Task interest/value:** Why this matters for your goals
- **Goal orientation:** Learning goals vs. performance goals

**Example:** "I'll master Zimmerman's three phases [goal] by creating a concept map and teaching it to a peer [strategy] because it's essential for my PDP [value]."

### Slide 10 (Layout: content)
## Performance Phase: While You're Learning

**Self-Control Strategies:**
- **Imagery:** Creating mental pictures to understand concepts
- **Self-instruction:** Talking yourself through processes
- **Attention focusing:** Eliminating distractions; deep work blocks
- **Task strategies:** Using proven techniques (we'll cover these in Segment 3)

**Self-Observation:**
- **Self-recording:** Tracking time, strategies used, progress
- **Self-experimentation:** Testing which approaches work best for you

**Example:** During study session, eliminate phone [attention focusing], use Pomodoro technique [task strategy], track which concepts require more review [self-recording].

### Slide 11 (Layout: content)
## Self-Reflection Phase: After Learning

**Self-Judgment:**
- **Self-evaluation:** Did I achieve my goal? To what extent?
- **Causal attribution:** Why did I succeed or struggle?
  - Adaptive: "I succeeded because I used active strategies"
  - Maladaptive: "I succeeded because it was easy" or "I failed because I'm not smart"

**Self-Reaction:**
- **Self-satisfaction/affect:** Emotional response to performance
- **Adaptive responses:** Adjusting strategies for next time
- **Defensive responses:** Avoiding challenges to protect self-image

**Example:** "I mastered two phases but struggled with self-reflection details [evaluation]. I need more elaboration and examples [attribution]. Next time I'll create more self-test questions [adaptive response]."

### Slide 12 (Layout: framework)
## Using SRL in Your Mentorship Program

| Phase | Before Meeting | During Meeting | After Meeting |
|-------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Forethought** | Set meeting goals; prepare questions; review previous reflections | | |
| **Performance** | | Focus attention; take notes; ask clarifying questions; self-monitor understanding | |
| **Self-Reflection** | | | Evaluate: Did I achieve goals? Why/why not? What will I do differently next meeting? |

**Your mentorship preparation forms align with this cycle—use them strategically.**

### Slide 13 (Layout: content)
## 🤝 Pair-Share: SRL Self-Assessment

**With a partner (3 minutes):**

1. Which phase of the SRL cycle is your **strongest**? Give an example.
2. Which phase is your **weakest**? Why?
3. What **one** specific change could strengthen your weakest phase?

**Be ready to share insights with the class.**

### Slide 14 (Layout: section-break)
# SEGMENT 2

## Self-Directed Learning in Practice

*From theory to actionable steps*

### Slide 15 (Layout: framework)
## University of Waterloo's Four-Step Process

```
STEP 1: Assess Readiness to Learn
    ↓
STEP 2: Set Learning Goals
    ↓
STEP 3: Engage in the Learning Process
    ↓
STEP 4: Evaluate Learning
    ↓
(Cycle repeats)
```

**Each step includes specific actions and tools.**

**SDL isn't "figure it out alone"—it's structured autonomy with support.**

### Slide 16 (Layout: content)
## Step 1: Assess Readiness to Learn

**Three dimensions to assess:**

**1. Attitudes:** Are you curious? Motivated? Open to learning?
**2. Abilities:** Do you have foundational skills? Time management? Learning strategies?
**3. Characteristics:** Are you self-disciplined? Persistent? Comfortable with ambiguity?

**Honest self-assessment identifies gaps so you can seek support.**

**Key insight:** SDL readiness can be developed—low readiness now doesn't mean you can't do SDL with appropriate scaffolding.

### Slide 17 (Layout: content)
## Step 2: Set Learning Goals (Learning Contracts)

**Learning Contract Components:**

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Learning goals** | What will I learn? | "I will understand digital marketing career pathways and required competencies" |
| **Strategies/Resources** | How will I learn it? | "Mentorship meetings, LinkedIn research, informational interviews" |
| **Evidence of accomplishment** | How will I know I learned it? | "I can describe 3 career paths with pros/cons and required skills" |
| **Timeline** | By when? | "By Week 8 mentorship meeting" |

**Learning contracts create accountability and clarity.**

### Slide 18 (Layout: content)
## Step 3: Engage in the Learning Process

**Active engagement strategies:**

**Identify diverse resources:**
- Human resources: mentors, peers, professionals, instructors
- Information resources: articles, books, online courses, podcasts
- Experiential resources: field trips, guest speakers, practice opportunities

**Select appropriate strategies:**
- Match strategies to learning goals (we'll cover evidence-based strategies in Segment 3)
- Use active approaches (testing, elaborating, discussing) over passive ones (rereading, highlighting)

**Monitor progress continuously:**
- Are you moving toward your goal? How do you know?
- What's working? What's not? What adjustments are needed?

### Slide 19 (Layout: content)
## Step 4: Evaluate Learning

**Self-reflection (internal evaluation):**
- Did I achieve my learning goals? To what extent?
- What strategies were most/least effective?
- What surprised me? What challenged me?
- How does this learning connect to my broader development goals?

**External feedback (seeking validation):**
- Share learning with mentor/peers and ask for feedback
- Test yourself formally (practice questions, teach someone else)
- Apply knowledge in real situations and assess results

**Action planning:**
- What will I do differently next time?
- What new learning needs emerged?
- How will I apply what I learned?

### Slide 20 (Layout: framework)
## Four-Step Process Applied to Your PDP

**Your Personal Development Plan follows this structure:**

| Step | PDP Component |
|------|---------------|
| **1. Assess Readiness** | SWOT analysis; self-assessment results (MBTI, VIA, EI) |
| **2. Set Goals** | SMART goals with 1-year, 3-year, 5-year milestones |
| **3. Engage** | Action plans; mentor meetings; skill development activities |
| **4. Evaluate** | Quarterly reviews; mentor feedback; progress tracking |

**Your PDP IS a learning contract with yourself about who you're becoming.**

### Slide 21 (Layout: content)
## 🤝 Pair-Share: Learning Contract Practice

**With your partner (3 minutes):**

Create a mini learning contract for **one** goal from your eventual PDP:

1. **Learning goal:** What specifically will you develop?
2. **Strategies/Resources:** How? (Must include at least 2 sources/approaches)
3. **Evidence:** How will you know you've achieved it?
4. **Timeline:** By when? (Be realistic)

**Share with your partner and give each other feedback on specificity.**

### Slide 22 (Layout: section-break)
# SEGMENT 3

## Metacognition & Evidence-Based Learning Strategies

*What actually works (and what doesn't)*

### Slide 23 (Layout: framework)
## Metacognition: Thinking About Thinking

**"Thinking about one's own thinking"** *(Flavell, 1979)*

**Three components (Stanton et al., 2021):**

1. **Metacognitive knowledge:** What you know about how you learn
   - Self-knowledge: "I learn concepts better through examples than definitions"
   - Task knowledge: "Understanding theories requires elaboration and application"
   - Strategy knowledge: "Self-testing reveals gaps better than rereading"

2. **Metacognitive monitoring:** Assessing your current understanding
   - "Do I really understand this, or does it just feel familiar?"
   - Calibration: Accuracy of self-assessment

3. **Metacognitive control:** Adjusting strategies based on monitoring
   - "This isn't working—I'll try a different approach"

### Slide 24 (Layout: content)
## Critical Evaluation: The Learning Styles Myth

**The claim:** Matching instruction to students' learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) improves learning.

**The evidence:** After decades of research, **no empirical support exists** for this "meshing hypothesis."

**Why it persists despite being debunked:**
- Feels intuitively right
- Confirms people's preferences
- Widely promoted in popular education literature

**What's true instead:**
- You have learning **preferences** (comfort), not learning **styles** (effectiveness)
- Multiple modalities benefit everyone, regardless of preference
- Evidence-based strategies work for all learners

**Bottom line:** Stop choosing strategies based on "your learning style." Use evidence-based strategies instead.

*(Pashler et al., 2008; Newton & Salvi, 2020; Stanton et al., 2021)*

### Slide 25 (Layout: framework)
## What Actually Works: Evidence-Based Strategies

**HIGH EFFECTIVENESS (Dunlosky et al., 2013):**

1. **Retrieval Practice (Self-Testing)**
   - Quiz yourself without notes; use flashcards; teach someone else
   - Why it works: Retrieving strengthens memory more than restudying

2. **Spaced Practice (Distributed Practice)**
   - Study across multiple sessions over time instead of cramming
   - Why it works: Spacing forces memory consolidation and reconsolidation

**MODERATE EFFECTIVENESS:**

3. **Elaboration**
   - Ask "why" and "how" questions; connect to what you know; use examples
   - Why it works: Creates meaningful connections and deeper processing

4. **Interleaving**
   - Mix different topics/problems during study instead of blocking by topic
   - Why it works: Forces discrimination between concepts and builds flexible understanding

### Slide 26 (Layout: content)
## Applying to Your Learning This Week

**To learn Week 4 content effectively:**

**✅ DO (Evidence-Based):**
- **Retrieval practice:** Close this lecture, write everything you remember about Zimmerman's model, then check accuracy
- **Spaced practice:** Review today's content tomorrow for 15 minutes, then again Friday
- **Elaboration:** Connect SRL concepts to your mentorship experiences—give specific examples
- **Self-testing:** Create 5 practice questions about today's content and answer them without notes

**❌ DON'T (Low Effectiveness):**
- Reread slides multiple times hoping content will "sink in"
- Highlight every seemingly important point in readings
- Copy notes verbatim without processing meaning
- Cram all Week 4 review into one Sunday night session

## Integration & Application

*Bringing it all together for your success*

### Slide 28 (Layout: framework)
## How the Frameworks Work Together

```
WATERLOO FOUR-STEP PROCESS (Structure)
    │
    ├──> Step 1: Assess Readiness ──> ZIMMERMAN: Forethought Phase + METACOGNITION: Self-Knowledge
    │
    ├──> Step 2: Set Goals ──> ZIMMERMAN: Goal Setting + Strategic Planning

    ├──> Step 3: Engage ──> ZIMMERMAN: Performance Phase + EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES: Retrieval, Spacing, Elaboration
    │
    └──> Step 4: Evaluate ──> ZIMMERMAN: Self-Reflection Phase + METACOGNITION: Monitoring & Control
```

**Waterloo provides the process. Zimmerman explains the psychology. Evidence-based strategies are the tactics. Metacognition makes it all conscious.**

### Slide 29 (Layout: content)
## Immediate Application: Preparing for Next Mentorship Meeting

**Before Meeting (Forethought + SDL Step 1-2):**
- Reflect on current development needs (metacognitive self-knowledge)
- Set 2-3 specific meeting goals using learning contract format
- Prepare questions using elaboration (connect to your experiences/interests)
- Review previous meeting reflections (self-regulated learning cycle)

**During Meeting (Performance + SDL Step 3):**
- Focus attention completely (self-control)
- Take notes, ask clarifying questions (active engagement)
- Monitor understanding in real-time (metacognitive monitoring)

**After Meeting (Self-Reflection + SDL Step 4):**
- Test yourself: Can you explain mentor's advice without notes? (retrieval practice)
- Evaluate goal achievement and strategy effectiveness (self-judgment)
- Identify action items and integrate into PDP (adaptive responses)
- Schedule follow-up actions using spaced practice

### Slide 30 (Layout: content)
## Before Next Class: Your Action Items

**By Friday (Week 4 Quiz):**
- [ ] Complete all three required readings (Zimmerman, Waterloo, Stanton)
- [ ] Use retrieval practice: summarize each reading from memory, then check accuracy
- [ ] Complete Week 4 quiz (tests understanding of self-regulated learning frameworks)

**By Monday Tutorial:**
- [ ] Create one learning contract for a PDP goal (practice for tutorial activity)
- [ ] Reflect: Which SRL phase is your weakest? What one change will you make?
- [ ] If you have mentorship meeting this week, apply today's frameworks to preparation

**Ongoing:**
- [ ] Experiment with evidence-based strategies: try retrieval practice and spaced review for ALL courses
- [ ] Monitor your metacognitive accuracy: Do you really understand, or just feel familiar?
