$CATEGORY: PPDK66B - Week 4

::Metacognition::According to Stanton et al. (2021), metacognition consists of three components. Which of the following correctly identifies all three components?{
=Metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive monitoring, and metacognitive control #Correct. These three components represent what you know about how you learn, tracking your understanding in real-time, and adjusting strategies based on monitoring.
~Forethought, performance, and self-reflection #Incorrect. These are the three phases of Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model, not the components of metacognition.
~Planning, monitoring, and evaluation #Incorrect. While these are similar concepts, they are not the precise terminology for the three components of metacognition as defined by Stanton et al. (2021).
~Self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-motivation #Incorrect. While these are related to effective learning, they are not the three components of metacognition.
####<b>Metacognition</b> (thinking about how you think and learn) has three components\: (1) <b>Metacognitive Knowledge</b> is what you know about how you learn best, (2) <b>Metacognitive Monitoring</b> is tracking your understanding in real-time, and (3) <b>Metacognitive Control</b> is adjusting your strategies based on monitoring. See Slide 6 for the framework.}

::Metacognition::You are reading a textbook chapter and notice, "Wait, I don't actually understand this paragraph—I need to reread it." Which component of metacognition are you demonstrating?{
~Metacognitive knowledge #Incorrect. Metacognitive knowledge is what you know about how you learn best (e.g., knowing that teaching concepts to others helps you retain them).
=Metacognitive monitoring #Correct. Metacognitive monitoring is tracking your understanding in real-time. Noticing that you don't understand a paragraph while reading is an example of monitoring your comprehension.
~Metacognitive control #Incorrect. Metacognitive control is adjusting your strategies based on monitoring. The decision to reread would be control, but noticing the lack of understanding is monitoring.
~Self-reflection #Incorrect. Self-reflection is a phase in Zimmerman's SRL model that occurs after learning, not during active reading.
####This scenario demonstrates <b>metacognitive monitoring</b>—tracking your understanding in real-time while learning. The recognition that you don't understand something is monitoring. If you then changed your strategy (e.g., switched from reading to self-explanation), that would be <b>metacognitive control</b>. See Slides 6-7 for examples of each component in action.}

::Metacognition::A student is preparing for an Economics exam. Instead of rereading notes, she tests herself with practice questions to check understanding, discovers she can't explain certain concepts, and switches to using self-explanation techniques. This demonstrates strong metacognition because the student is\:{
~Using only metacognitive knowledge to select appropriate strategies #Incorrect. While the student is using knowledge, the scenario demonstrates all three components working together, not just knowledge alone.
=Applying all three components\: testing shows knowledge, discovering gaps shows monitoring, and switching strategies shows control #Correct. The student demonstrates metacognitive knowledge (knowing to test herself), metacognitive monitoring (discovering gaps through self-testing), and metacognitive control (adjusting strategy based on the monitoring).
~Using retrieval practice without any metacognitive awareness #Incorrect. The student is demonstrating metacognitive awareness by monitoring her understanding and adjusting strategies based on what she discovers.
~Relying on fluency illusions to guide her studying #Incorrect. Fluency illusions occur when rereading makes material feel familiar, creating false confidence. This student is avoiding fluency illusions by actively testing her knowledge.
####Strong metacognition integrates all three components. The student shows <b>metacognitive knowledge</b> (understanding that self-testing reveals true comprehension), <b>metacognitive monitoring</b> (discovering through practice questions that she can't explain concepts), and <b>metacognitive control</b> (switching from one strategy to another based on monitoring feedback). See Slide 7 for the contrast between studying with and without metacognition.}

::Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model::In Zimmerman's Cyclical Phase Model of self-regulated learning (2002), which phase occurs BEFORE learning begins and involves goal setting and strategic planning?{
=Forethought phase #Correct. The forethought phase occurs before learning and includes task analysis (goal setting and strategic planning) and self-motivation beliefs (self-efficacy, outcome expectations).
~Performance phase #Incorrect. The performance phase occurs during learning and involves self-control and self-observation strategies.
~Self-reflection phase #Incorrect. The self-reflection phase occurs after learning and involves self-judgment and self-reaction.
~Assessment phase #Incorrect. There is no 'assessment phase' in Zimmerman's model. The model consists of forethought, performance, and self-reflection phases.
####Zimmerman's model has three cyclical phases\: (1) <b>Forethought</b> occurs before learning and includes goal setting, strategic planning, and self-efficacy beliefs; (2) <b>Performance</b> occurs during learning and involves executing strategies while monitoring; (3) <b>Self-Reflection</b> occurs after learning and involves evaluating effectiveness and adapting. The three phases cycle continuously—reflection from one episode informs forethought for the next. See Slide 9 for the cyclical diagram.}

::Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model::A student studying for an accounting exam says\: "This is challenging, but I CAN learn it if I use active practice. My goal is to master double-entry bookkeeping by tonight using Khan Academy videos and practice problems." Which phase and component of Zimmerman's model is this student demonstrating?{
~Performance phase\: self-control strategies #Incorrect. Self-control strategies occur during the learning process (e.g., eliminating distractions, using Pomodoro technique). This student is planning before beginning.
=Forethought phase\: task analysis and self-efficacy beliefs #Correct. The student demonstrates task analysis (setting a specific goal and identifying strategies/resources) and self-efficacy beliefs (confidence that they can learn with focused practice).
~Self-reflection phase\: causal attribution #Incorrect. Causal attribution occurs after learning when analyzing why something succeeded or failed. This student is planning before learning begins.
~Performance phase\: self-observation #Incorrect. Self-observation involves tracking progress during learning (e.g., 'I've completed 6/10 problems and I'm struggling with compound interest'). This student is in the planning stage.
####This scenario demonstrates the <b>forethought phase</b>, which occurs before learning begins. The student shows <b>task analysis</b> by setting a specific goal (master double-entry bookkeeping by tonight) and planning strategies (Khan Academy videos, practice problems). The student also demonstrates <b>self-efficacy beliefs</b> by expressing confidence that active practice will lead to learning despite the challenge. See Slide 10 for details on the forethought phase components.}

::Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model::After a study session, a student reflects\: "Practice problems helped me understand concepts, but I struggled with calculations. Next session, I'll focus more on calculations and work through additional examples." This demonstrates which aspect of self-regulated learning?{
~Performance phase\: self-instruction #Incorrect. Self-instruction involves talking yourself through problems during learning. This student is reflecting after the learning session has ended.
=Self-reflection phase with adaptive reaction, which cycles back to inform the next forethought phase #Correct. The student demonstrates self-evaluation (assessing what worked and what didn't) and an adaptive reaction (planning to adjust strategy). This reflection will inform forethought for the next study session, illustrating the cyclical nature of Zimmerman's model.
~Forethought phase\: strategic planning #Incorrect. While the student is planning for the next session, this occurs as a result of self-reflection after the current session. The cyclical model shows how reflection feeds into the next forethought phase.
~Performance phase\: self-experimentation #Incorrect. Self-experimentation involves trying different methods during learning and noting what works. This student is reflecting after learning to plan adjustments for the future.
####This demonstrates the <b>self-reflection phase</b>, specifically <b>self-evaluation</b> (assessing that practice problems helped with concepts but calculations remain challenging) and <b>adaptive reaction</b> (deciding to adjust strategy for the next session). The cyclical nature of Zimmerman's model means this reflection becomes <b>forethought</b> for the next learning episode. See Slides 12-13 for the self-reflection phase and how it cycles back to forethought.}

::Self-Directed Learning Framework::According to the University of Waterloo's four-step framework for self-directed learning, what are the four steps in order?{
=Assess readiness to learn, set learning goals, engage in the learning process, evaluate learning #Correct. These are the four steps in order\: (1) assess your current knowledge and motivation, (2) create learning goals/contracts, (3) identify resources and use active learning, (4) evaluate through self-reflection, peer feedback, and performance evidence.
~Set goals, assess readiness, engage in learning, evaluate outcomes #Incorrect. The order matters—you must assess readiness before setting goals to ensure you understand your starting point and what resources you need.
~Forethought, performance, self-reflection, adaptation #Incorrect. These are phases from Zimmerman's self-regulated learning model, not the University of Waterloo's self-directed learning framework.
~Identify goals, plan strategies, implement plan, monitor progress #Incorrect. While these are reasonable learning steps, they don't match the specific four-step framework from University of Waterloo.
####The University of Waterloo's <b>self-directed learning (SDL)</b> framework consists of four steps\: (1) <b>Assess Readiness to Learn</b> (what do I know, am I motivated, do I have necessary background); (2) <b>Set Learning Goals</b> (create learning contracts); (3) <b>Engage in the Learning Process</b> (identify resources, apply active learning); (4) <b>Evaluate Learning</b> (self-reflection, peer/expert feedback, performance evidence). See Slide 16 for the complete framework.}

::Self-Directed Learning Framework::What is the key difference between self-regulated learning (SRL) and self-directed learning (SDL)?{
=SRL occurs within structured environments where instructors set goals; SDL occurs outside formal structures where learners set their own goals #Correct. SRL helps you manage learning in contexts like university courses where goals are set by instructors. SDL applies when you independently decide what to learn and manage the entire process yourself.
~SRL is for beginners and SDL is for advanced learners #Incorrect. Both SRL and SDL can be used by learners at any level. The difference is about context (structured vs. self-initiated), not skill level.
~SRL focuses on cognitive strategies while SDL focuses on motivational strategies #Incorrect. Both SRL and SDL involve cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational strategies. The key difference is the context and who sets the learning goals.
~SRL uses Zimmerman's framework while SDL uses the University of Waterloo framework #Incorrect. While these are the frameworks we discussed for each, the fundamental difference is about the learning context (structured vs. self-initiated), not which framework is used.
####<b>Self-Regulated Learning (SRL)</b> occurs within structured environments like university courses, where instructors set learning objectives and you manage how you study. <b>Self-Directed Learning (SDL)</b> occurs when you independently identify learning needs and manage the entire learning process yourself. Example\: Using retrieval practice to study for your economics exam is SRL. Teaching yourself Python for career development is SDL. See Slide 15 for the comparison table.}

::Self-Directed Learning Framework::A student creates this development plan\: "Learning Goal\: Develop intermediate proficiency in data visualization using Python. Current Level\: Beginner—never used Python. Target Level\: Create professional dashboards. Timeline\: 6 weeks. Success Evidence\: Portfolio of 5 visualizations with positive mentor feedback." This student is using which component of the self-directed learning framework?{
~Step 1\: Assess readiness to learn #Incorrect. While the student mentions current level (which relates to readiness), the primary focus is on creating a structured plan with goals, timeline, and success criteria.
=Step 2\: Set learning goals using a learning contract #Correct. This is a learning contract that includes what to learn (data visualization in Python), current and target levels, timeline, and evidence of success—all key components of Step 2 in the SDL framework.
~Step 3\: Engage in the learning process #Incorrect. Step 3 involves actually using resources and applying active learning techniques. This student is still in the planning/goal-setting phase.
~Step 4\: Evaluate learning #Incorrect. While the plan mentions success evidence, the student hasn't yet learned or evaluated—they're creating the learning contract that will guide the process.
####This is a <b>learning contract</b>, which is the key tool in Step 2 of the SDL framework\: Set Learning Goals. A learning contract specifies what you want to learn, why it matters, your current and target levels, learning strategies, resources needed, timeline, and how you'll measure success. See Slide 17 for a complete learning contract example. This tool makes vague goals (like "improve my skills") concrete and actionable.}

::Evidence-Based Learning Strategies::According to Dunlosky et al. (2013), which TWO learning strategies have the strongest evidence (high utility) for improving learning outcomes?{
=Practice testing/retrieval practice and distributed practice/spacing #Correct. These two strategies have the strongest evidence base. Practice testing strengthens memory pathways and reveals knowledge gaps. Distributed practice (spacing) forces memory consolidation and improves long-term retention.
~Highlighting and rereading #Incorrect. These are actually low-utility strategies despite being popular. They are passive activities that create fluency illusions rather than deep learning.
~Summarization and elaborative interrogation #Incorrect. These are moderate-utility strategies (conditional evidence), not high-utility. They can be effective but depend on how they're implemented.
~Interleaving and self-explanation #Incorrect. These are moderate-utility strategies with conditional evidence. Interleaving and elaborative interrogation are useful but don't have the same strength of evidence as retrieval practice and spacing.
####The two <b>high-utility strategies</b> with strong research evidence are\: (1) <b>Practice Testing/Retrieval Practice</b> (actively retrieving information from memory through self-quizzing, flashcards, practice problems) and (2) <b>Distributed Practice/Spacing</b> (spreading study sessions over time instead of cramming). <b>Moderate-utility strategies</b> include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaving. See Slide 21 for the evidence-based strategies.}

::Evidence-Based Learning Strategies::Why is retrieval practice more effective than rereading for long-term learning?{
~Retrieval practice takes less time than rereading #Incorrect. Time efficiency is not the primary reason. Retrieval practice can actually take more effort than passive rereading, but it's the cognitive effort that creates learning.
=Retrieval practice strengthens memory pathways and reveals what you don't actually know, while rereading creates recognition but not recall #Correct. Retrieval practice forces you to actively recall information, which strengthens neural pathways. It also provides metacognitive feedback about what you truly know versus what merely looks familiar. Rereading creates fluency illusions—you recognize content but can't retrieve it on demand.
~Retrieval practice matches your learning style better than rereading #Incorrect. Learning styles are a neuromyth. Retrieval practice is effective for everyone regardless of learning preferences because it engages fundamental memory processes.
~Retrieval practice uses visual processing while rereading uses verbal processing #Incorrect. Both can involve visual and verbal processing depending on the material. The key difference is active retrieval versus passive recognition.
####<b>Retrieval practice</b> (actively recalling information without looking at notes) is more effective than rereading because\: (1) it strengthens memory pathways through effortful recall, (2) it reveals gaps in knowledge, providing metacognitive feedback, and (3) it prevents <b>fluency illusions</b>—the false confidence that comes from recognizing familiar material. Rereading creates recognition (you've seen it before) but not recall (you can retrieve it when needed). See Slide 21 for why retrieval practice is high-utility.}

::Evidence-Based Learning Strategies::A student is preparing for a final exam covering 12 weeks of content. Which approach best applies evidence-based learning strategies?{
~Reread all 12 textbook chapters during Week 1, create summary notes during Week 2, then reread notes multiple times until the exam #Incorrect. This approach relies entirely on low-utility strategies (rereading, summarization without retrieval). It creates fluency illusions but doesn't test actual retrieval ability.
=Take a diagnostic practice test on Day 1 to identify weak areas, study one topic per day using spaced practice and self-testing, then use interleaved practice mixing problem types and full practice exams in Week 2 #Correct. This approach combines multiple evidence-based strategies\: diagnostic testing (metacognitive monitoring), spaced practice (distributed learning), retrieval practice (self-testing), interleaving (mixing topics), and practice exams (retrieval under test conditions). This maximizes learning efficiency.
~Identify your learning style and study using only that modality for all 12 topics #Incorrect. Learning styles are a neuromyth. Matching instruction to learning style preferences doesn't improve outcomes. Using multiple modalities and evidence-based strategies is more effective.
~Cram intensively the night before the exam to ensure the material is fresh in your mind #Incorrect. Cramming violates the spacing principle and interferes with sleep, which is essential for memory consolidation. Distributed practice over time creates better long-term retention.
####The most effective approach applies multiple <b>evidence-based strategies</b>\: (1) <b>Retrieval practice</b> through diagnostic tests and self-testing to identify gaps, (2) <b>Spaced/distributed practice</b> studying over days rather than cramming, (3) <b>Interleaving</b> mixing different topics/problem types to improve transfer, and (4) <b>Practice exams</b> under test conditions. This contrasts with low-utility approaches relying on passive rereading and highlighting. See Slides 21-23 for evidence-based strategies and their application.}
