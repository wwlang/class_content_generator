# Self-Managed Learning
## Learning How to Learn

**Week 4: Personal & Professional Development**
PPDK66B | National Economics University
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Welcome to Week 4. Today we tackle one of the most valuable meta-skills for your career: learning how to learn.

**Key Points:** In the AI era, your ability to continuously learn and adapt is more important than any specific knowledge you have today. The half-life of technical skills is shrinking—what you learn in Year 1 may be outdated by graduation. That's why metacognition and self-regulated learning are essential.

**Example:** Google's internal research found that "learning ability" was the #1 predictor of success in their organization—above technical skills, leadership, or even IQ.

**Transition:** "Let's begin with a startling fact about one of education's most persistent myths..."

# 89%

**of teachers worldwide believe "learning styles" (VARK, Kolb) improve learning outcomes**

**Scientific studies supporting this claim: 0**

*(Newton & Salvi, 2020; Pashler et al., 2008)*
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Let this statistic sit for 3 seconds. Nearly 9 out of 10 educators believe something that science has comprehensively debunked.

**Key Points:** This isn't about teachers being wrong—it's about how persistent intuitive-but-false ideas can be. The "learning styles" myth feels true, which is why it persists despite zero supporting evidence. Today we'll learn what ACTUALLY works for learning.

**Check Understanding:** "How many of you have been told you're a 'visual learner' or 'hands-on learner'?" [show of hands]. "Did that feel true to you?" [most nod yes].

**Example:** You might prefer visual presentations, but that preference doesn't mean you learn BETTER from visuals than from other modalities. The content determines the best method—anatomy requires visuals, language learning requires listening, swimming requires physical practice.

**Transition:** "This is why we need METACOGNITION—thinking critically about how we think and learn. Let's see what we'll cover today..."

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** metacognition and its three components (knowledge, monitoring, control)
2. **Apply** Zimmerman's Cyclical Phase Model of self-regulated learning to your own learning
3. **Distinguish** between self-regulated learning (SRL) and self-directed learning (SDL)
4. **Use** the University of Waterloo four-step SDL framework to create learning contracts
5. **Critically evaluate** the "learning styles" claim using the meshing hypothesis
6. **Implement** evidence-based learning strategies (retrieval practice, spacing, interleaving) in your study habits
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** These aren't just academic concepts—you'll use them this week and throughout your career.

**Key Points:** LO1-2: You'll learn the most widely used model of self-regulated learning (3,317+ citations). LO3-4: You'll create an actual learning contract for a PDP goal. LO5: You'll understand WHY learning styles persist despite lack of evidence. LO6: You'll replace ineffective study habits (highlighting, rereading) with proven strategies.

**Example:** By Friday, you'll prepare for Mentor Meeting #2 using the four-step SDL process. By next week, you'll use retrieval practice instead of passive rereading for your other courses.

**Check Understanding:** "These objectives will appear on this week's quiz—note them down."

**Transition:** "Here's how this connects to your major assessments..."

## How This Prepares You

| Assessment | Weight | Today's Relevance |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Mentorship Program** | 20% | Use SDL framework to prepare for Meeting #2; set learning goals with mentor |
| **Personal Development Plan** | 40% | Learning strategies section; self-monitoring approach; goal achievement plans |
| **Reflective Essay** | 10% | Metacognitive analysis of field trip and guest speaker experiences |
| **Final Oral Exam** | 30% | Demonstrate self-awareness of your learning and development process |

**Self-regulated learning is an explicit PDP rubric criterion**
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** "Your next mentor meeting happens in the next 2 weeks—today's content directly prepares you for it."

**Key Points:** Mentor Meeting #2 focus: Share self-assessment results and discuss career interests. Use the SDL framework to set specific learning goals with your mentor. PDP Part 2: Skills Gap Analysis requires identifying HOW you'll develop each skill—learning contracts provide structure. PDP Part 5: Implementation & Accountability uses Zimmerman's cycle for self-monitoring.

**Example:** Instead of writing "I will improve my Excel skills" in your PDP, you'll create a learning contract: goal, current level, target level, strategies, resources, timeline, success evidence. Then you'll use the three-phase SRL cycle to monitor progress.

# Part 1: Understanding Metacognition

**Thinking About Thinking**
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Transition:** Metacognition is the foundation of all self-managed learning. If you don't understand HOW you think and learn, you can't improve those processes.

## What is Metacognition?

**Metacognition** is awareness and understanding of your own thought processes—essentially, *thinking about how you think and learn.*

### The Three Components (Stanton et al., 2021):

1. **Metacognitive Knowledge**
   What you know about how you learn best

2. **Metacognitive Monitoring**
   Tracking your understanding in real-time

3. **Metacognitive Control**
   Adjusting your strategies based on monitoring
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Flavell (1979) coined the term "metacognition" to describe this higher-order thinking about thinking. It's what separates expert learners from novices.

**Key Points:** Component 1 (Knowledge): You know from experience that teaching concepts to others helps you retain them better. Component 2 (Monitoring): While reading, you notice "Wait, I don't actually understand this paragraph—I need to reread it." Component 3 (Control): Based on monitoring, you change strategy—switching from passive reading to active self-explanation.

**Example:** Poor metacognition: Reading textbook chapter, highlighting sentences, feeling like you understand because material looks familiar, then being surprised when exam is hard. Strong metacognition: Reading chapter, closing book, trying to recall main points, realizing you can't, changing strategy to use retrieval practice and self-testing.

**Check Understanding:** "Think about your last exam. Did you accurately KNOW what you understood vs. didn't understand before the exam? That's metacognitive monitoring."

**Transition:** "Let's see metacognition in action with a concrete example..."

## Metacognition in Action: Exam Preparation

**Scenario:** You're studying for your Economics midterm in 2 weeks.

### WITHOUT Metacognition:
- Reread textbook chapters passively
- Highlight sentences that seem important
- Assume you understand because material looks familiar
- Feel surprised when exam questions are harder than expected
- **Result:** Overconfident going in, underperform on exam

### WITH Metacognition:
- Test yourself with practice questions to CHECK understanding
- Monitor: "I can recognize concepts but can't explain them yet"
- Adjust strategy: Switch from rereading to self-explanation
- Control: Use retrieval practice—close book, teach concepts aloud
- **Result:** Accurate calibration, targeted study, better performance
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** This is the difference between feeling prepared and actually being prepared.

**Key Points:** Without metacognition, students rely on "fluency illusions"—when rereading makes material FEEL familiar, they mistake recognition for true understanding. With metacognition, they actively test their knowledge and discover gaps before the exam.

**Example:** Stanton et al. (2021) found that students' predictions of their exam scores were often wildly inaccurate—they thought they knew material but couldn't apply it. Metacognitive monitoring (self-testing, practice problems) reveals true knowledge.

**Research Connection:** This connects to Dunlosky's research on learning strategies—retrieval practice is high-utility because it provides metacognitive feedback. Highlighting is low-utility because it doesn't.

**Check Understanding:** "How many of you have felt confident before an exam, then struggled during it? That's a metacognitive calibration problem."

**These three phases cycle continuously—reflection from one learning episode informs forethought for the next.**
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** This is a CYCLICAL model, not linear. You're constantly moving through these phases.

**Key Points:** Phase 1 (Forethought) happens BEFORE learning—you set goals and plan strategies. Phase 2 (Performance) happens DURING learning—you execute strategies while monitoring your understanding. Phase 3 (Self-Reflection) happens AFTER learning—you evaluate effectiveness and adapt.

**Example:** Studying for an exam: Forethought (decide to study supply/demand using practice problems). Performance (work through problems, notice you're struggling with elasticity calculations). Self-Reflection ("Practice problems helped with concepts but I need more work on calculations—next session I'll focus there").

**Visual Emphasis:** Point to the circular arrows—this isn't "do these three steps once and you're done." After reflection, you cycle back to forethought for the next learning session, armed with insights from the previous cycle.

**Transition:** "Let's break down each phase in detail, starting with Forethought..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="detailed-framework">
<content>
## Phase 1: Forethought (Before Learning)

### Task Analysis
**Goal Setting:** What specifically do you want to learn or achieve?
- ❌ Vague: "Study marketing"
- ✅ Specific: "Master the 4Ps framework and apply it to 3 real company case studies"

**Strategic Planning:** What methods and resources will you use?
- "Read textbook chapter 3, create concept map of 4Ps, analyze Vinamilk marketing mix, complete 5 practice problems"

### Self-Motivation Beliefs
- **Self-Efficacy:** Confidence that you CAN learn this material
- **Outcome Expectations:** Belief that learning this will lead to valuable outcomes
- **Learning Goal Orientation:** Focused on mastery and understanding, not just grades
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Forethought is the PLANNING phase before you begin learning. Poor learners skip this phase and just "start studying" without clear goals.

**Key Points:** Task Analysis breaks learning into manageable components. Goal Setting must be SPECIFIC—"study marketing" is too vague to guide action. Strategic Planning identifies HOW you'll learn—which resources, which techniques, in what order.

**Example:** Student 1 (weak forethought): "I need to study for my accounting exam" [opens textbook, starts reading from page 1, gets bored after 20 minutes]. Student 2 (strong forethought): "My goal is to master journal entries for asset transactions by tonight. I'll use three strategies: watch Khan Academy video, work through 10 practice problems, teach the concept to my roommate. I know this is challenging but I CAN learn it if I use active practice."

**Self-Motivation Beliefs:** These predict effort and persistence. If you believe "I'm just bad at math" (low self-efficacy), you'll give up quickly. If you believe "I can improve with practice" (growth mindset + self-efficacy), you'll persist through difficulty.

**Transition:** "Once you've planned in the Forethought phase, you move to the Performance phase..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="detailed-framework">
<content>
## Phase 2: Performance (During Learning)

### Self-Control Strategies
**Attention Focusing:** Eliminate distractions
- Turn off phone, use Pomodoro Technique (25-min focused blocks)

**Self-Instruction:** Talk yourself through difficult problems
- "Okay, first I identify the variables, then I set up the equation..."

**Task Strategies:** Use specific learning techniques
- Elaborative interrogation, concept mapping, retrieval practice

### Self-Observation Strategies
**Self-Recording:** Track your study time and progress
- "I've completed 6/10 practice problems; I'm struggling with problems involving compound interest"

**Self-Experimentation:** Try different methods and note what works
- "Concept maps work better for me than linear notes for this subject"
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** The Performance phase is where learning actually happens—you're executing your plan while simultaneously monitoring how it's going.

**Key Points:** Self-Control strategies help you STICK with your plan despite distractions or difficulty. Self-Observation strategies help you NOTICE what's working and what isn't IN REAL-TIME.

**Example:** You're studying financial accounting using practice problems (task strategy). You eliminate distractions by putting phone in another room (attention focusing). While working, you notice that you keep making the same error on depreciation calculations (self-observation/self-recording). You talk yourself through the next problem step-by-step to catch the error (self-instruction).

**Research Connection:** Newport's "Deep Work" emphasizes attention focusing. Clear's "Atomic Habits" discusses environmental design for self-control. These aren't new ideas—they're applications of Zimmerman's framework.

**Common Student Error:** Students often execute strategies without self-observation. They study for 3 hours but never check if they're actually learning anything. Self-observation prevents this waste of time.

**Transition:** "After the learning session, you move to the Self-Reflection phase..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="detailed-framework">
<content>
## Phase 3: Self-Reflection (After Learning)

### Self-Judgment
**Self-Evaluation:** How well did I learn this?
- Test yourself: "Can I explain this concept to someone who's never heard of it?"
- Apply it: "Can I use this in a different context?"

**Causal Attribution:** WHY did this succeed or fail?
- ✅ Good attribution: "Success came from using practice problems and spaced repetition" (controllable)
- ❌ Poor attribution: "I'm just naturally good/bad at this subject" (uncontrollable)

### Self-Reaction
**Self-Satisfaction:** Emotional response to performance
- Celebrate successes to reinforce effective strategies

**Adaptive vs. Defensive Reactions:**
- ✅ Adaptive: "This strategy didn't work, so I'll try a different approach next time"
- ❌ Defensive: "This subject is stupid anyway" or giving up entirely
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Self-Reflection is where LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE happens. Without this phase, you repeat the same ineffective strategies forever.

**Key Points:** Self-Evaluation requires actually TESTING your knowledge—not just feeling like you understand. Causal Attribution determines whether you'll improve—attributing success/failure to controllable factors (effort, strategy use) maintains motivation.

**Example:** After studying for 2 hours: Poor reflection: "I read the chapter twice, so I'm probably ready for the quiz." [No self-evaluation, no causal attribution, no plan to adjust]. Strong reflection: "Let me close the book and see if I can recall the main concepts... Okay, I can remember the definitions but I struggled to explain the examples. That tells me I need more elaboration, not just memorization. Next study session, I'll use the 'teach it to someone' technique instead of rereading."

**Causal Attribution Research:** Dweck's work on growth mindset connects here. Students who attribute success to effort and strategy (controllable factors) persist longer and perform better than students who attribute it to innate ability.

**Adaptive vs. Defensive Reactions:** Defensive reactions protect your ego but prevent improvement. Adaptive reactions are uncomfortable (admitting your strategy failed) but lead to better performance.

**Transition:** "Now let's see the full cycle in action with a concrete example..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="application-example">
<content>
## Applying the Full Cycle: Learning Financial Accounting

**FORETHOUGHT PHASE:**
- **Goal:** Master double-entry bookkeeping by end of week
- **Strategy:** Watch 2 Khan Academy videos, work through 10 practice problems, teach concept to roommate
- **Self-Efficacy:** "I struggled with this initially, but I CAN learn it with focused practice"

**PERFORMANCE PHASE:**
- **Self-Control:** Phone in drawer, 25-minute Pomodoro blocks
- **Task Strategy:** Create visual flowchart showing how debits/credits affect each account type
- **Self-Observation:** "I keep confusing asset vs. liability treatments—need to focus here"

**SELF-REFLECTION PHASE:**
- **Self-Evaluation:** Test myself—can solve 8/10 problems correctly, struggle with complex transactions
- **Attribution:** "Visual flowchart helped a lot; teaching revealed gaps in my understanding"
- **Adaptive Reaction:** "Next session: spend more time on complex transactions, create more visual aids"

**➜ This reflection becomes forethought for the next study session—the cycle continues!**
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Let's walk through a real example of how this cycle works in practice.

**Key Points:** Notice how the student is STRATEGIC in Forethought (specific goal, multiple strategies). During Performance, they MONITOR their understanding and notice the confusion with assets vs. liabilities. In Self-Reflection, they EVALUATE their actual knowledge (8/10 is good but not perfect), ATTRIBUTE success to specific strategies (not luck), and ADAPT for next session.

**Example:** This is dramatically different from typical studying: "I need to learn accounting [vague goal]. I'll read the chapter [single strategy]. I finished reading, so I'm done [no evaluation]. I hope I do okay on the exam [no plan to adjust]."

**Check Understanding:** "Who can tell me: In which phase does the student notice they're confusing assets and liabilities?" [Performance—self-observation]. "In which phase do they decide to create visual aids?" [Self-Reflection—adaptive reaction, which then becomes Forethought for the next cycle].

**Connection to Week 3:** This is applying Gibbs' Reflective Cycle to your OWN learning process. The Self-Reflection phase mirrors Gibbs' "Evaluation" and "Action Plan" stages.

# Part 3: Self-Directed Learning

**University of Waterloo's Four-Step Framework**
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Transition:** Zimmerman's model focuses on self-regulated learning—managing learning WITHIN structured environments like university. Now we'll look at SELF-DIRECTED learning—learning you initiate and manage OUTSIDE formal structures.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework-comparison">
<content>
## Self-Regulated vs. Self-Directed Learning

| Aspect | Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) | Self-Directed Learning (SDL) |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Context** | Within structured environments (courses, programs) | Outside formal structures (self-initiated) |
| **Goals** | Set by instructors/curriculum | Set by the learner |
| **Examples** | Managing study time for exams<br>Choosing note-taking methods<br>Seeking help on assignments | Teaching yourself Python<br>Learning language independently<br>Building portfolio projects |
| **Framework** | Zimmerman's 3-phase cycle | Waterloo's 4-step process |

**Both are critical:** SRL helps you succeed in formal education; SDL helps you continuously adapt throughout your career.
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** These are complementary, not competing frameworks. You need both.

**Key Points:** SRL is about managing learning in contexts where someone ELSE sets the learning objectives (your professors set exam topics). SDL is about managing learning when YOU set the objectives (deciding to learn graphic design because you think it will be valuable).

**Example:** SRL in action: Your professor assigns Chapter 5 for next week's quiz. You use Zimmerman's model to plan when you'll read it, how you'll study (retrieval practice vs. highlighting), and how you'll test your understanding. SDL in action: You notice that many job postings require Tableau skills. You decide to learn it independently—you set the goal, find resources, create a learning plan, and assess your own progress.

**Career Relevance:** In university, 80% of your learning is SRL (managing coursework). In your career, 80% of valuable learning will be SDL (identifying what you need to know and teaching yourself).

**Check Understanding:** "Think about something you taught yourself outside of school—cooking, video editing, a sport. That's self-directed learning. Did you have a structured plan, or did you just explore randomly?"

**Transition:** "Here's a practical framework for structuring SDL..."

## Four Steps to Self-Directed Learning

### Step 1: Assess Readiness to Learn
- What do I already know about this topic?
- Am I motivated to learn this? Why?
- Do I have necessary background knowledge?
- What resources are available?

### Step 2: Set Learning Goals
Create a **learning contract** with:
- What I want to learn (specific knowledge/skills)
- How I will learn it (strategies and resources)
- When I will accomplish it (timeline)
- How I will know I've learned it (evidence)

### Step 3: Engage in the Learning Process
- Identify and use quality resources
- Apply active learning techniques
- Maintain momentum, overcome obstacles

### Step 4: Evaluate Learning
- Self-reflection: Can I apply this in real contexts?
- Peer feedback: What do others observe?
- Expert feedback: What does mentor/instructor say?
- Performance evidence: Can I demonstrate mastery?

*Source: University of Waterloo Centre for Teaching Excellence*
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** This is the most practical, accessible SDL framework available—and it's free and open-access.

**Key Points:** Step 1 (Assess) prevents wasted effort—you check what you already know and whether you're ready. Step 2 (Set Goals) uses learning contracts to make goals specific and measurable. Step 3 (Engage) is where actual learning happens—emphasis on ACTIVE learning. Step 4 (Evaluate) ensures you're actually achieving mastery, not just going through motions.

**Example:** Student wants to learn Excel for job applications. Step 1: "I can do basic formulas but nothing advanced. I'm motivated because 70% of analyst jobs require Excel. I have access to LinkedIn Learning through university." Step 2: [Creates learning contract—see next slide]. Step 3: Completes LinkedIn Learning course, practices with real datasets from Kaggle, builds 3 portfolio dashboards. Step 4: Shows dashboards to mentor for feedback, applies skills in internship application project.

**Connection to Mentorship:** Your mentor meetings should follow this structure. Meeting 1: Assess readiness (share self-assessments, discuss background). Meeting 2-3: Set goals and engage in learning. Meeting 4: Evaluate progress.

**Transition:** "Let's look at the most practical tool: the learning contract..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="practical-tool">
<content>
## Learning Contract Template

**Learning Goal:** Develop intermediate proficiency in data visualization using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Why This Matters:** Data storytelling is essential for business analyst roles; visualizations strengthen internship applications

**Current Level:** Beginner—can create basic charts in Excel; never used Python for visualization

**Target Level:** Intermediate—create professional multi-chart dashboards; customize colors/labels/layouts; present insights clearly

**Learning Strategies:**
- Complete DataCamp "Data Visualization with Python" course
- Work through 10 practice datasets from Kaggle
- Recreate 5 visualizations from The Economist

**Resources Needed:**
- DataCamp subscription ($25/month)
- Python installed on laptop
- "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic
- Mentor feedback

**Timeline:** 6 weeks (Oct 1-Nov 15)
- Weeks 1-2: Basics (Matplotlib fundamentals)
- Weeks 3-4: Intermediate (Seaborn, multi-chart layouts)
- Weeks 5-6: Projects (portfolio pieces)

**Success Evidence:**
- Portfolio of 5 publication-quality visualizations
- Ability to explain design choices
- Positive mentor feedback on dashboard project
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** This is what a complete learning contract looks like. You'll create one in today's tutorial.

**Key Points:** Every field is specific and measurable. "Current Level" honestly assesses starting point (no exaggeration). "Target Level" is ambitious but achievable in 6 weeks. "Learning Strategies" combines structured learning (DataCamp), practice (Kaggle datasets), and deliberate modeling (recreating professional examples). "Success Evidence" defines how you'll KNOW you've achieved the goal.

**Example:** Compare this to a vague PDP goal: "Improve my technical skills." The learning contract forces specificity: WHICH technical skill? WHAT level? WHAT strategies? HOW will you measure success?

**Connection to PDP:** Part 2 of your Personal Development Plan (Skills Gap Analysis) should include learning contracts for each skill you plan to develop. This gives your mentor something concrete to discuss and provide feedback on.

**Tutorial Application:** "In today's tutorial, you'll create a learning contract for ONE goal from your preliminary PDP. Bring your course syllabus or assessment handbook—you'll need to identify a skill or knowledge area you want to develop."

# Part 4: The Learning Styles Neuromyth

**Why It Persists & What Actually Works**
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Transition:** We opened with the statistic that 89% of teachers believe learning styles work. Let's understand WHY this myth persists and what the science actually says.
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="research-evidence">
<content>
## The Learning Styles Claim

**POPULAR BELIEF:**
Matching instruction to students' preferred learning styles (Visual/Auditory/Reading-Writing/Kinesthetic) improves learning outcomes.

**SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS:**
Comprehensively debunked—no credible evidence supports this claim.

### Key Evidence:

**Pashler et al. (2008)** - *Psychological Science in the Public Interest*
"We found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern" required to validate the meshing hypothesis (matching instruction to learning style preferences).

**Newton & Salvi (2020)**
89-90% of teachers worldwide still believe learning styles improve learning, despite lack of evidence—a persistent "neuromyth."

**Coffield et al. (2004)**
Identified 71 different learning styles models with major validity and reliability problems.
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** This isn't a minor debate—this is one of education's most thoroughly researched questions. The verdict is clear.

**Key Points:** The "meshing hypothesis" is the core claim: that visual learners learn BETTER from visual instruction than from auditory instruction (and vice versa). This interaction effect—the key prediction—has never been demonstrated in rigorous research despite decades of studies.

**Example:** If learning styles worked, a student identified as a "visual learner" should perform better on a test when the material was taught visually vs. when taught verbally. This has been tested extensively. Result: Teaching method matters (some methods are more effective than others), but matching the method to "learning style" doesn't improve outcomes.

**Why It Persists:** (1) Face validity—it FEELS intuitively true. (2) Preferences exist—people DO prefer certain modalities. (3) Commercial interests—learning styles assessments and training generate revenue. (4) Confirmation bias—people remember times it seemed to work, forget times it didn't.

**Respectful Tone:** "This isn't about blaming teachers who believe this—it's about how compelling pseudoscience can be when it aligns with intuition."

**Transition:** "Let's clarify what's true vs. what's not..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="myth-vs-reality">
<content>
## Learning Styles: Myth vs. Reality

### THE MYTH (Not Supported by Evidence):
- People have fixed learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- You should study using your preferred style to learn best
- Teachers should match instruction to students' learning styles
- Knowing your learning style helps you learn more effectively

### THE REALITY (Evidence-Based):
- People have learning **preferences**, but matching instruction to preferences doesn't improve learning
- The **content** determines the best method: anatomy requires visuals, languages require listening, swimming requires physical practice
- Using **multiple modalities** for the same content strengthens learning (dual coding theory)
- Effective learning depends on **strategies** (retrieval practice, spacing, interleaving), not preferences

**Bottom line:** Preferences exist but don't predict learning effectiveness. Focus on evidence-based strategies instead.
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Let's be precise about what's debunked vs. what's true.

**Key Points:** Preferences ARE real—you might enjoy visual presentations more than lectures. But enjoying something doesn't mean you learn better from it. A visual learner who studies using only visual materials will learn LESS than someone who uses multiple modalities, even if the latter approach feels less enjoyable.

**Example:** Learning Vietnamese history: You might prefer reading (reading/writing style), but watching historical documentaries (visual), discussing events with classmates (auditory), and visiting historical sites (kinesthetic) will create deeper learning than reading alone—even though it's not your "preferred style."

**Dual Coding Theory:** Allan Paivio's research shows that combining verbal and visual information creates stronger memory traces than either alone. This is the OPPOSITE of learning styles logic (which says stick to your preference).

**Student Concern:** "But I really do learn better from visual presentations!" Response: "You might learn better from visual presentations than from POOR verbal presentations. But the question is: does being a 'visual learner' mean you learn BETTER from visuals than an 'auditory learner' does? Research says no—the quality of instruction matters more than the match to preference."

**Transition:** "So if learning styles don't work, what DOES work?"

## What ACTUALLY Works: Evidence-Based Strategies

*Based on Dunlosky et al. (2013) - Psychological Science in the Public Interest*

### HIGH UTILITY (Strong Evidence):

**1. Practice Testing / Retrieval Practice**
- Self-quizzing, flashcards, practice problems—actively retrieving information from memory
- **Why it works:** Strengthens memory pathways; reveals what you don't actually know
- **How to use:** Close book and write everything you remember; use flashcards; teach concepts without notes

**2. Distributed Practice / Spacing**
- Spreading study sessions over time instead of cramming
- **Why it works:** Spaced repetition forces memory consolidation and long-term retention
- **How to use:** Study 30 min today, 30 min in 3 days, 30 min in a week—NOT 90 min the night before

### MODERATE UTILITY (Conditional Evidence):

**3. Elaborative Interrogation** - Asking "why" and "how" questions
**4. Self-Explanation** - Explaining steps and reasoning while problem-solving
**5. Interleaving** - Mixing different topics or problem types during study
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** These strategies have DECADES of research supporting them. They work for everyone, regardless of "learning style."

**Key Points:** Retrieval Practice is the #1 most powerful technique—yet most students rely on rereading (weak evidence). Spacing Effect has been replicated hundreds of times—yet students cram before exams.

**Example:** Retrieval Practice in action: After reading this lecture, close your notes and try to write down the three phases of Zimmerman's model from memory. Struggle to recall? That struggle is LEARNING. Look it up, then try again in 10 minutes. That's retrieval practice. Compare to: Rereading these slides 5 times. Feels easier, but produces weaker learning.

**Spacing Example:** Learning 50 vocab words for language class. Poor: Study all 50 words for 3 hours Sunday night before Monday quiz. Better: Study 10 words Monday (20 min), 10 words Wednesday (20 min), 10 words Friday (20 min), review all 50 Saturday (20 min), final review Monday morning (20 min). Same total time, vastly better retention.

**Interleaving:** Math example: Instead of doing 20 algebra problems, then 20 geometry problems, alternate: algebra, algebra, geometry, algebra, geometry, geometry, algebra... This is harder (you can't rely on momentum) but creates better transfer.

**Transition:** "Now let's look at strategies that are popular but ineffective..."

## Low-Utility Strategies (Despite Popularity)

These FEEL productive but have weak evidence:

### ❌ Highlighting / Underlining
- **Why popular:** Easy; feels like you're doing something; creates colorful notes
- **Why ineffective:** Passive activity; doesn't require deep processing; students often highlight too much or wrong things
- **Better alternative:** Write summaries in your own words; create questions from highlighted content

### ❌ Rereading
- **Why popular:** Familiar material feels easier; creates illusion of fluency
- **Why ineffective:** Recognition ≠ recall; you can recognize concepts but fail to retrieve them on exams
- **Better alternative:** Read once carefully, then test yourself; reread only sections you couldn't recall

### ❌ Summarization (without training)
- **Why popular:** Feels productive; creates study notes
- **Why ineffective:** Students often copy sentences rather than synthesizing; effectiveness depends on quality
- **Better alternative:** Summarize from memory without looking; use Cornell note-taking method

**Key message:** These aren't harmful, but they're inefficient. 3 hours highlighting = wasted time vs. 1 hour retrieval practice.
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** I'm not saying never highlight or reread. I'm saying don't rely on these as your PRIMARY study strategies.

**Key Points:** Students love these techniques because they're EASY and create visible progress (colorful notes, feeling of fluency). But "feeling productive" ≠ "actually learning." These create "fluency illusions"—you mistake familiarity for knowledge.

**Highlighting Example:** Student highlights 80% of the textbook. Now what? They reread the highlighted parts (also low-utility). They've spent hours but haven't tested whether they can actually recall or apply the information.

**Rereading Illusion:** Material feels easier the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time you read it. This feels like learning, but it's just recognition. The test isn't "do you recognize this concept when you see it?"—it's "can you retrieve and apply it when prompted?"

**Summarization:** Can be effective IF you do it properly (from memory, in your own words, organized hierarchically). But most students just copy-and-condense sentences from the textbook, which is barely better than rereading.

**Not Harmful, Just Inefficient:** If you have limited study time (and you do), spending it on low-utility techniques means NOT spending it on high-utility techniques. Opportunity cost.

**Practical Advice:** "You can highlight while reading—that's fine. But don't STOP there. After highlighting, close the book and test yourself. The testing is where learning happens."

**Transition:** "Let's see how to apply evidence-based strategies to real studying..."

## Applying Evidence-Based Strategies: Final Exam Prep

**Scenario:** 2 weeks to prepare for Microeconomics final exam covering 12 weeks of content.

### INEFFECTIVE APPROACH (Common but Low-Utility):
**Week 1:** Days 1-5: Reread all 12 chapters, highlighting important sections
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days 6-7: Create summary notes from highlighted passages

**Week 2:** Days 8-12: Reread summary notes multiple times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days 13-14: Panic cramming the night before

**Problems:** No retrieval practice (don't know what you've learned), massive cramming violates spacing, passive rereading creates false confidence

### EFFECTIVE APPROACH (Evidence-Based):
**Week 1:** Day 1: Take diagnostic practice test to identify weak areas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days 2-7: Study ONE topic/day using spaced practice—read, self-test, teach to partner

**Week 2:** Days 8-10: Interleaved practice—mix problem types; self-test on prior topics
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days 11-12: Full practice exams under timed conditions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days 13-14: Light review of weak areas; rest well; avoid cramming

**Why this works:** Retrieval practice strengthens memory, spacing enhances retention, interleaving improves transfer, practice tests reveal gaps
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Same 2 weeks, dramatically different outcomes.

**Key Points:** Ineffective approach FEELS productive—you're doing something (reading, highlighting, summarizing). But you're not testing whether you can actually retrieve and apply knowledge. Effective approach is HARDER—testing yourself reveals gaps, which feels uncomfortable. But that difficulty is desirable—it's where learning happens.

**Diagnostic Practice Test (Day 1):** This is metacognitive monitoring. Instead of assuming you know what you need to study, you TEST to find out. Maybe you discover Chapters 3 and 8 are fine, but Chapters 5, 7, and 11 need serious work. Now you can focus your limited time strategically.

**One Topic Per Day (Spaced Practice):** This feels slower than powering through all 12 chapters in 5 days. But spacing is scientifically proven to create better long-term retention. Your brain needs time to consolidate.

**Interleaving (Days 8-10):** Mixing different problem types prevents you from relying on context cues. On the actual exam, you don't know which chapter each question comes from—you need to identify the right framework yourself. Interleaving trains this.

**Practice Exams (Days 11-12):** Simulate test conditions. This is retrieval practice + metacognitive monitoring + test-taking skill development all at once.

**Rest (Days 13-14):** Sleep is when memory consolidation happens. Cramming the night before interferes with sleep, which undermines all your previous preparation.

## Self-Managed Learning in Your PDP

### Part 2: Skills Gap Analysis
- Use **readiness assessment** (SDL Step 1) to identify current skill levels
- Create **learning contracts** (SDL Step 2) for each skill you plan to develop
- Apply **evidence-based strategies** to your development timeline
- *Example:* Learning Python—plan spaced practice sessions over 8 weeks, not intensive weekend workshop

### Part 3: SMART Goals
- Use **Zimmerman's Forethought Phase** for goal-setting and strategic planning
- Build in **self-monitoring checkpoints** (Performance Phase)
- Plan **regular self-evaluation moments** (Self-Reflection Phase)
- *Example:* Goal = "Learn data analytics"—create learning contract with milestones, practice tests, portfolio projects

### Part 5: Implementation & Accountability
- Design timeline using **spacing and interleaving principles**
- Build in **retrieval practice moments**—how will you test skill development?
- Plan **self-reflection cycles** to adjust strategies based on progress
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Your PDP is due in Week 11. Today's content provides the STRUCTURE for how you'll achieve your goals.

**Key Points:** Skills Gap Analysis (Part 2) shouldn't just list skills—it should include HOW you'll develop each one. Learning contracts make this concrete. SMART Goals (Part 3) should incorporate the SRL cycle—not just "I will achieve X by Y date" but "I will achieve X by using strategies A, B, C, monitoring via checkpoint D, and adjusting if needed."

**Example:** Weak PDP entry: "Improve my public speaking skills over the next year." Strong PDP entry: [Complete learning contract with current level = "nervous, monotone, minimal eye contact"; target level = "confident, varied vocal delivery, natural eye contact, engaging stories"; strategies = "Join Toastmasters, present in every class, record myself monthly"; resources = "Toastmasters membership, 'Talk Like TED' book, mentor feedback"; timeline = "12 months with monthly checkpoints"; success evidence = "Deliver 15-minute presentation at student conference without notes, positive peer evaluations"].

**Implementation Section:** Don't just create a Gantt chart of when you'll work on goals. Apply spacing—if learning Excel, spread practice over 8 weeks (3 hours/week) rather than one intensive 24-hour weekend. Build in retrieval practice—monthly self-tests where you try to use skills without notes. Plan reflection checkpoints—quarterly reviews with mentor to evaluate progress and adjust strategies.

**Connection to Mentorship:** Discuss your learning contracts with your mentor in Meeting #2 or #3. Ask: "Does this timeline seem realistic? Am I missing any important resources? How did you develop this skill?"

**Transition:** "One more application: using SRL for mentorship meetings..."

## Using SRL for Mentorship Meetings

### FORETHOUGHT PHASE (Before Meeting):
- **Goal:** What do I want to accomplish in this meeting?
- **Strategic Planning:** Prepare 5 thoughtful questions; review notes from last meeting; complete commitments I made
- **Self-Efficacy:** "I'm prepared and will make the most of this hour"

### PERFORMANCE PHASE (During Meeting):
- **Self-Control:** Active listening, taking notes, asking follow-up questions
- **Self-Observation:** Notice which advice resonates most; identify gaps in my understanding
- **Task Strategies:** Use elaborative questions—"Can you give me an example?" "How did you handle that?"

### SELF-REFLECTION PHASE (After Meeting):
- **Self-Evaluation:** What were the 3 most valuable insights? What action items?
- **Causal Attribution:** "My preparation made this meeting more productive than last time"
- **Adaptive Reaction:** "Next meeting, I'll ask more about career transitions—that advice was helpful"

**Continuous cycle:** Reflection from Meeting 1 becomes forethought for Meeting 2—you improve with each interaction!
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** You have 4 required mentor meetings this semester. Most students treat these casually. High performers treat them strategically.

**Key Points:** Forethought = Pre-Meeting Preparation Form (required 48 hours before). Performance = Active engagement during the meeting itself. Self-Reflection = Post-Meeting Reflection Form (required 48 hours after). But instead of treating these forms as bureaucratic requirements, use them as SRL tools.

**Example:** Meeting 1 (weak approach): Show up, answer mentor's questions, nod politely, say "thank you," leave. No preparation, no goals, passive participation, no follow-up. Meeting 1 (strong approach): BEFORE—read mentor's bio, prepare 5 specific questions about their career transitions, identify 2 things from self-assessments to discuss. DURING—take notes, ask follow-up questions ("You mentioned X—can you elaborate?"), seek specific advice. AFTER—identify 3 action items, schedule them in calendar, email mentor thanking them and confirming next steps.

**Progression Across Meetings:** Your questions should become MORE sophisticated. Meeting 1: "How did you choose marketing?" (basic). Meeting 2: "You mentioned that project X was a turning point—what specific skills did you develop there?" (elaborative interrogation). Meeting 3: "I'm trying to decide between Brand Management and Digital Marketing—based on my CliftonStrengths results, which do you think aligns better?" (applying self-knowledge).

**Rubric Connection:** Mentorship Program rubric has "Professional Development Progress" (20%)—visible growth trajectory across 4 meetings. Using the SRL cycle ensures you're not just having 4 similar conversations but actually DEVELOPING across the semester.

**Transition:** "Let's wrap up with key takeaways..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="key-takeaways">
<content>
## Key Takeaways

1. **Self-regulated learning is a SKILL you can develop**—it's not a fixed trait

2. **Use Zimmerman's three phases continuously:**
   Forethought (plan) → Performance (do + monitor) → Self-Reflection (evaluate + adjust)

3. **Metacognition**—thinking about your thinking—is the foundation of effective learning

4. **Learning styles are a neuromyth**; focus on evidence-based strategies:
   - Retrieval practice (HIGH utility)
   - Spacing / distributed practice (HIGH utility)
   - Elaboration, self-explanation, interleaving (MODERATE utility)

5. **Create learning contracts for your PDP goals**—define what, why, how, when, and how you'll measure success

6. **Apply the SRL cycle to mentorship meetings** to maximize learning from each interaction
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** Let's consolidate what we've covered in 90 minutes.

**Key Points:** Read each takeaway, pause for 3 seconds to let it sink in. Emphasize #1—this is good news! You're not born a good or bad learner; you can develop these skills. #4 is the most surprising for students—encourage them to try evidence-based strategies THIS WEEK in their other courses.

**Check Understanding:** "Can someone explain why learning styles are a myth?" [Look for answer about the meshing hypothesis—that matching instruction to preferences doesn't improve outcomes]. "Can someone give me an example of retrieval practice?" [Self-testing, flashcards, teaching without notes, practice problems].

**Call to Action:** "This week, try ONE evidence-based strategy in one of your other courses. Replace rereading with retrieval practice. Replace cramming with spaced practice. Track whether you notice a difference."

**Transition:** "Let's preview what's next and what you need to do this week..."

## Next Steps

### Week 5: Self-Discovery Through Assessment
Explore MBTI, VIA Character Strengths, CliftonStrengths, and Holland Code to understand your personality, values, and career preferences

### This Week's Actions:
1. **Tutorial:** Create a learning contract for one PDP goal using the four-step SDL process
2. **Self-Assessment:** What are your current learning strategies? Which evidence-based strategies will you adopt?
3. **Apply SRL cycle:** Use Forethought-Performance-Reflection for this week's study in other courses
4. **Reading:**
   - Zimmerman (2002) - Self-regulated learning overview
   - University of Waterloo - Self-directed learning guide
   - Stanton et al. (2021) - Fostering metacognition

### Reflection Question:
**How can you apply metacognitive monitoring to improve your learning THIS WEEK in your other courses?**
</content>
<speaker-notes>
**Opening:** "Here's what's coming up and what you need to do before we meet again."

**Key Points:** Week 5 is Self-Discovery—you'll take all your self-assessments (MBTI, VIA, CliftonStrengths, Holland Code, EI). Everything builds toward your PDP. Today's tutorial is PRACTICAL—you'll actually create a learning contract, not just listen to more theory.

**Reading Expectations:** Zimmerman (2002) is available open-access despite being paywalled—search for it on ResearchGate or University of Bath repository. It's THE foundational paper on SRL (3,317 citations). Stanton et al. (2021) is open-access on PubMed Central—focuses on metacognition and evidence-based strategies.

**Reflection Question:** This is metacognitive practice. Ask yourself: "In my other courses, how do I currently study? Am I using high-utility or low-utility strategies? What's ONE change I can make this week based on today's lecture?"

**Final Encouragement:** "Learning how to learn is life's most important skill. You now have the frameworks used at Stanford, Wharton, and top business schools worldwide. Use them."

**Closing:** "Questions before we head to tutorial?"
