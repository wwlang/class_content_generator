## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to:

1. Conduct an energy audit across Schwartz's four dimensions and design renewal rituals
2. Create a time-blocked weekly schedule protecting Quadrant 2 priorities
3. Design habit stacks using implementation intentions for 2-3 target behaviors
4. Assess current deep work capacity and develop a 12-week building plan
5. Integrate all frameworks into a coherent Personal Development Plan productivity system

---

## Quick Review (5 minutes)

### Four Frameworks Covered in Lecture

**1. Energy Management (Schwartz)**
- Four dimensions: Physical, Emotional, Mental, Spiritual
- Energy is renewable; time is finite
- Strategic renewal through breaks and rituals

**2. Prioritization (Eisenhower + Time-Blocking)**
- Eisenhower Matrix: Urgent vs. Important
- Protect Quadrant 2 (Important but Not Urgent) time
- Time-blocking prevents urgency from displacing important work

**3. Deep Work (Newport)**
- High-Quality Work = Time × Focus Intensity
- Attention residue costs of task-switching
- Rhythmic scheduling: Same daily time blocks

**4. Habits (Clear + Lally)**
- Cue-Routine-Reward loop
- Four Laws: Make it obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying
- Median 66 days for habit formation; missing one day doesn't derail progress

**Quick Check:** Any questions on the frameworks before we apply them?

## Main Activity (75 minutes)

You will create four deliverables that feed directly into your Personal Development Plan:

1. Energy Audit & Renewal Strategy (15 min)
2. Time-Blocked Weekly Schedule (20 min)
3. Habit Stacking Plan (20 min)
4. Deep Work Capacity Building Plan (20 min)

### Activity 1: Energy Audit & Renewal Strategy (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Self-Assessment (8 minutes)**

Rate yourself 1-10 (1 = completely depleted, 10 = fully energized) across four dimensions:

| Dimension | Current Rating (1-10) | Evidence/Indicators | Primary Energy Drains |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Physical Energy** | | (Sleep quality, energy levels, physical health) | |
| **Emotional Energy** | | (Mood, stress levels, relationships) | |
| **Mental Energy** | | (Focus ability, cognitive clarity, overwhelm) | |
| **Spiritual Energy** | | (Sense of purpose, values alignment, motivation) | |

**Reflection prompts:**
- Physical: How many hours did you sleep last night? When do you feel most/least energetic?
- Emotional: What situations drain your emotional energy? What replenishes it?
- Mental: How many hours can you focus before losing concentration? What distracts you most?
- Spiritual: Do your studies feel connected to your values and goals? When do you feel most purposeful?

**Step 2: Design Renewal Rituals (7 minutes)**

For each dimension, design ONE specific renewal ritual you'll implement this week:

| Dimension | Renewal Ritual (Specific Action) | When/Frequency | Expected Benefit |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Physical** | Example: "20-minute walk after lunch" | Daily, 12:30pm | Restore energy, break sedentary pattern |
| **Emotional** | Example: "Call friend for 15-minute check-in" | 3× weekly, evenings | Social connection, stress relief |
| **Mental** | Example: "5-minute meditation before study session" | Daily before first study block | Clear mind, improve focus |
| **Spiritual** | Example: "Weekly reflection: How studies connect to career goals" | Sunday evenings, 20 min | Reconnect with purpose, sustain motivation |

**Your rituals:**

| Dimension | My Renewal Ritual | When/Frequency | Expected Benefit |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Physical | | | |
| Emotional | | | |
| Mental | | | |
| Spiritual | | | |

**Tutor Checkpoint:** Share one renewal ritual with a neighbor. Does it meet criteria: specific, scheduled, realistic?

---

### Activity 2: Time-Blocked Weekly Schedule (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Identify Quadrant 2 Priorities (5 minutes)**

List your most important tasks/goals for next week using Eisenhower Matrix:

| Quadrant | Tasks This Week |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Q1: Urgent & Important** (Do First) | Example: Assignment due Friday, presentation tomorrow |
| | |
| **Q2: Not Urgent but Important** (Schedule) | Example: Start reading for next essay, exercise 3×, thesis research |
| | |
| **Q3: Urgent but Not Important** (Minimize) | Example: Friend needs help with non-critical task, optional meeting |
| | |
| **Q4: Neither Urgent nor Important** (Eliminate) | Example: Binge-watching, excessive social media |
| | |

**Key Question:** How much time are you currently spending in Quadrant 2? (Estimate: _____ hours/week)

**Step 2: Block Deep Work Time (7 minutes)**

Identify your peak energy hours and schedule deep work blocks:

**My peak energy times:** (Circle) Morning (6-10am) / Mid-morning (10am-12pm) / Afternoon (1-4pm) / Evening (6-9pm) / Late night (9pm+)

**Deep work commitment:** I will schedule _____ hours of deep work daily at these times:

| Day | Deep Work Block 1 | Focus Task | Deep Work Block 2 | Focus Task |
|-----|------------------|------------|------------------|------------|
| Monday | | | | |
| Tuesday | | | | |
| Wednesday | | | | |
| Thursday | | | | |
| Friday | | | | |
| Saturday | | | | |
| Sunday | | | | |

**Rules:**
- Each block: Minimum 90 minutes (can use Pomodoro within block)
- Phone OFF or in another room
- Single-task only (no email, messaging during block)
- Schedule breaks between blocks

**Step 3: Create Full Weekly Time-Blocked Schedule (8 minutes)**

Using your calendar app or planner, block your ENTIRE week:

**Categories to block:**
- Deep work (from Step 2)
- Classes/tutorials
- Shallow work (email, admin, scheduling)
- Meals
- Exercise/movement
- Social time
- Sleep
- Renewal rituals (from Activity 1)
- Buffer time (for unexpected)

**Newport's advice:** Schedule every hour. When things change (and they will), re-block remaining hours.

**Deliverable:** Screenshot or photo of your completed time-blocked week. Save for PDP.

**Tutor Checkpoint:** Do you have at least 10 hours of Quadrant 2 deep work scheduled? Are renewal rituals included?

---

### Activity 3: Habit Stacking Plan (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Select Target Habits (5 minutes)**

Choose 2-3 habits you want to build that support your productivity system:

**Criteria:**
- Aligned with Quadrant 2 priorities
- Realistic to maintain for 66+ days
- Start small (can always increase later)

**Examples:**
- Review lecture notes immediately after class
- 10-minute planning session every morning
- Evening shutdown ritual (review day, plan tomorrow)
- Exercise 3× weekly
- Read academic article weekly for thesis research

**My target habits:**

1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________
3. ________________________________________________

**Step 2: Create Habit Stacks (7 minutes)**

For each habit, write implementation intention using formula: **"After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"**

| # | After [CURRENT HABIT]... | I will [NEW HABIT]... | Location | Duration |
|---|-------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Example: After I sit down in class | I will turn phone to airplane mode | Classroom | 5 seconds |
| | | | | |
| 2 | Example: After I close laptop after last class | I will review today's notes for 10 minutes | Library study desk | 10 min |
| | | | | |
| 3 | Example: After I put head on pillow | I will practice 5-minute breathing exercise | Bed | 5 min |
| | | | | |

**Your habit stacks:**

| # | After [CURRENT HABIT]... | I will [NEW HABIT]... | Location | Duration |
|---|-------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |

**Step 3: Apply Four Laws Analysis (8 minutes)**

For ONE of your habit stacks, complete Four Laws analysis:

**Selected Habit:** ________________________________________________

| Law | Strategy | My Implementation |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| **1st Law: Make it OBVIOUS** (Cue) | How will you make cue impossible to miss? | Example: Set phone alarm, put sticky note on laptop, visual reminder |
| | | |
| **2nd Law: Make it ATTRACTIVE** (Craving) | What makes this habit appealing? How can you increase attractiveness? | Example: Pair with enjoyable activity, join study group where behavior is norm |
| | | |
| **3rd Law: Make it EASY** (Response) | How will you reduce friction? | Example: Prepare materials night before, start with 2-minute version |
| | | |
| **4th Law: Make it SATISFYING** (Reward) | How will you create immediate satisfaction? | Example: Check box on habit tracker, share progress with friend |
| | | |

**Commitment:** I will track this habit daily for the next 66 days using: ☐ App ☐ Calendar ☐ Journal ☐ Other: __________

**Tutor Checkpoint:** Share one habit stack with neighbor. Is the cue specific (time + location)? Is the new habit realistic?

### Activity 4: Deep Work Capacity Building Plan (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Current State Assessment (5 minutes)**

**Honest self-assessment:**

1. How many hours per day can you currently work with COMPLETE focus (no phone, no distractions, single task)? ______ hours

2. How many days per week do you achieve deep work sessions? ______ days

3. What are your three biggest barriers to deep work?
   - Barrier 1: ________________________________________
   - Barrier 2: ________________________________________
   - Barrier 3: ________________________________________

4. Rate your ability to resist distractions (1-10): ______

**Current Deep Work Total:** _____ hours/day × _____ days/week = _____ hours/week

**Step 2: Design 12-Week Capacity Building Plan (10 minutes)**

Newport says most people max out around 4 hours daily. Build gradually:

| Weeks | Daily Deep Work Target | Days/Week | Total Weekly Hours | Focus for This Phase |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **1-2** | | | | Establish rhythm: Same time daily, start small |
| **3-4** | | | | Eliminate distractions: Phone protocols, environment design |
| **5-6** | | | | Extend duration: Add 30 min to blocks |
| **7-8** | | | | Add second daily block if capacity allows |
| **9-10** | | | | Refine shutdown rituals and recovery |
| **11-12** | | | | Assess and stabilize at sustainable level |

**Example progression:**
- Weeks 1-2: 1.5 hours/day, 5 days/week = 7.5 hours/week (building routine)
- Weeks 3-4: 2 hours/day, 5 days/week = 10 hours/week (distraction elimination)
- Weeks 5-6: 2.5 hours/day, 5 days/week = 12.5 hours/week (extended focus)
- Weeks 7-8: 3 hours/day, 6 days/week = 18 hours/week (second block added)
- Weeks 9-10: 3 hours/day, 6 days/week = 18 hours/week (maintain, refine)
- Weeks 11-12: 3 hours/day, 6 days/week = 18 hours/week (stabilize)

**Step 3: Barrier Elimination Strategy (5 minutes)**

For each barrier identified in Step 1, design concrete solution:

| Barrier | Solution Strategy | Implementation |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Example: "Friends constantly message during study" | Set expectations + phone protocol | "Send group message: 'Deep work 9-11am daily, will respond after.' Phone in drawer during blocks." |
| 1. | | |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |

**Weekly tracking commitment:** I will track actual deep work hours each week and adjust plan if needed.

**Tutor Checkpoint:** Is your 12-week plan realistic? Are you starting small enough to ensure success?
