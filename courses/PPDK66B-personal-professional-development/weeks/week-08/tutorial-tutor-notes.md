## Pre-Tutorial Preparation

### Materials Checklist

**Student Materials Required:**
- ☐ Laptop or tablet with calendar app
- ☐ Tutorial handout (printed or digital)
- ☐ Week 8 lecture slides for reference
- ☐ Personal planner/calendar (digital or physical)

**Tutor Materials Required:**
- ☐ Example completed deliverables (see Appendix)
- ☐ Timer for activity management
- ☐ Whiteboard/projector for key reminders
- ☐ James Clear's free templates (URLs in tutorial content)

### Key Concepts to Reinforce

| Concept | Common Misconception | Correct Understanding |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Energy Management** | "I just need better time management" | Energy is renewable; time is not. Managing capacity matters more than scheduling |
| **Eisenhower Matrix** | "Everything feels urgent and important" | True crises are rare. Most urgent tasks are others' priorities (Q3) |
| **Deep Work** | "I can multitask effectively" | Attention residue makes multitasking cognitively expensive. Single-tasking produces higher quality |
| **Habit Formation** | "21 days to form a habit" | Median 66 days (range 18-254); missing one day doesn't derail progress |
| **Implementation Intentions** | "I'll exercise more" (vague) | "After I pour morning coffee, I will do 10 pushups" (specific cue + behavior) |

## Activity-by-Activity Facilitation Guide

### Quick Review (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Refresh frameworks before application

**Facilitation:**
1. Display four framework titles on board: Energy Management, Prioritization, Deep Work, Habits
2. Ask: "Which framework resonates most with you? Why?" (2-3 quick responses)
3. Clarify any confusion from lecture
4. Emphasize: "Today is application, not discussion. You'll leave with concrete implementation tools."

**Common Questions:**
- *"Do we have to use all four frameworks?"* → Yes, they integrate into complete system. Each addresses different productivity dimension.
- *"What if my schedule is too unpredictable?"* → Time-blocking adapts. When disrupted, re-block remaining hours. Builds flexibility, not rigidity.

---

### Activity 1: Energy Audit & Renewal Strategy (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Diagnose current energy state, design specific renewal interventions

**Facilitation Tips:**

**Step 1: Self-Assessment (8 min)**
- Emphasize honesty: "This is for you, not graded. Accurate diagnosis leads to effective solutions."
- Circulate and observe ratings:
  - If all ratings are 8-10: Gently challenge—"Are there truly no areas for improvement?"
  - If all ratings are 1-3: Offer reassurance—"Starting point for growth. You'll design solutions today."
- Help students identify specific evidence: "Not just 'I'm tired' but 'I sleep 5 hours, skip breakfast, sit 10 hours daily'"

**Step 2: Design Rituals (7 min)**
- Enforce specificity criteria: Must include WHAT, WHEN, WHERE
  - ❌ "Exercise more" → ⭕ "20-minute walk after lunch daily at 12:30pm"
  - ❌ "Be more positive" → ⭕ "Write three gratitude statements after morning coffee"
- Encourage starting small: Better to complete small ritual consistently than abandon ambitious plan
- Connect to research: "Schwartz's Wachovia study showed structured renewal rituals improved performance"

**Valid Approaches:**

| Dimension | Acceptable Renewal Rituals | Red Flags |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Physical | Sleep schedule, movement breaks, nutrition improvements, hydration | Vague ("eat better"), extreme ("train 2 hours daily" from sedentary baseline) |
| Emotional | Social connection, gratitude practice, fun activities, therapy/counseling | Suppression ("just think positive"), avoidance |
| Mental | Meditation, journaling, single-tasking practice, digital detox periods | Adding more cognitive work, skipping breaks |
| Spiritual | Values clarification, purpose reflection, meaningful work, service | Forced religious practice (respect individual beliefs) |

**Checkpoint 1 (2 min):**
- Students share ONE ritual with neighbor
- Listening partner checks: ☐ Specific ☐ Scheduled ☐ Realistic
- Tutor circulates to spot-check quality

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may feel shame admitting struggles (especially mental/emotional energy depletion)
- Normalize: "Everyone has energy drains. Identifying them is first step to sustainable performance."
- Spiritual energy may be interpreted religiously; clarify it means "sense of purpose and meaning" (secular interpretation valid)

---

### Activity 2: Time-Blocked Weekly Schedule (20 minutes)

**Purpose:** Translate priorities into protected calendar time

**Facilitation Tips:**

**Step 1: Eisenhower Matrix (5 min)**
- Common problem: Students put everything in Q1 or claim everything is urgent
- Challenge: "If everything is urgent, nothing is. What could wait a week without serious consequences?" (That's Q2)
- Help distinguish Q2 (important) from Q3 (urgent but not important):
  - Q2: Builds long-term capacity (studying early, skill development, health)
  - Q3: Others' urgent requests that don't align with your goals
- Watch for: Students who have no Q2 items (living in constant reactivity)

**Step 2: Block Deep Work (7 min)**
- Verify students identify realistic peak energy times (not wishful thinking)
  - If student says "I'm most focused at 2am" but admitting they're sleep-deprived → suggest trying morning hours after addressing sleep
- Minimum block: 90 minutes (hard to achieve deep work in shorter windows)
- Guide realistic expectations:
  - Beginners: 1-2 hours daily is excellent
  - Most people: 3-4 hours maximum sustainable daily deep work
- Ensure phone protocols: Not just "phone on silent"—must be in different room or locked drawer

**Step 3: Full Schedule (8 min)**
- Students often resist blocking "everything": "That feels too rigid"
  - Explain: "Newport says this creates flexibility. When disrupted, you consciously re-allocate, not drift."
- Must include:
  - ✅ Classes (fixed commitments)
  - ✅ Deep work blocks (from Step 2)
  - ✅ Meals and sleep
  - ✅ Renewal rituals (from Activity 1)
  - ✅ Shallow work time (email, admin)
  - ✅ Social/relationship time
  - ✅ Buffer time (unexpected)
- Red flags:
  - No buffer time (schedule will collapse at first disruption)
  - No sleep scheduled or less than 7 hours
  - Deep work scheduled late at night after full day (unlikely to sustain)

**Checkpoint 2 (2 min):**
- Check: Do students have 10+ hours of Q2 deep work protected across week?
- Check: Are renewal rituals included?
- If no: Help identify where to shift or eliminate Q3/Q4 activities

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may feel social obligation to be constantly available to friends/family
- Validate: "Protecting deep work time doesn't mean you don't care. It means you're managing your energy so you CAN show up fully later."
- Discuss how to communicate boundaries: "I'm in a study session until 3pm, I'll call you after"

---

### Activity 3: Habit Stacking Plan (20 minutes)

**Purpose:** Design automatic behavior triggers using implementation intentions

**Facilitation Tips:**

**Step 1: Select Target Habits (5 min)**
- Guide students toward productivity-supporting habits (not unrelated personal goals)
- Must align with their Q2 priorities identified in Activity 2
- Common mistake: Choosing too many habits or too ambitious habits
  - Limit: 2-3 habits
  - Start small: 2-minute version of behavior (can scale later)
- Valid examples:
  - ✅ Review notes immediately after class
  - ✅ Morning planning session (5-10 min)
  - ✅ Evening shutdown ritual
  - ✅ Exercise before first study block
  - ❌ "Be more organized" (not specific behavior)
  - ❌ "Study harder" (vague)

**Step 2: Create Habit Stacks (7 min)**
- Enforce implementation intention format: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"
- Key criteria:
  - Current habit must be truly automatic (already doing daily without thought)
  - Cue must be specific (time + location)
  - New habit must be immediately after cue (not "sometime after")
- Test specificity: "If I gave this instruction to someone else, could they execute it exactly?"
  - ❌ "After class, I'll study" → When? Where? Which class?
  - ✅ "After I close laptop in 2pm lecture, I will walk to library and review notes for 10 minutes at my usual desk"

**Step 3: Four Laws Analysis (8 min)**
- Students complete this for ONE habit stack (most important one)
- Provide examples for each law to spark ideas:
  - **1st Law (Obvious):** Visual cues, phone reminders, environment design, sticky notes, calendar blocks
  - **2nd Law (Attractive):** Temptation bundling (pair with pleasant activity), join group where behavior is norm, reframe mindset
  - **3rd Law (Easy):** Reduce friction, 2-minute start, prepare environment night before, remove obstacles
  - **4th Law (Satisfying):** Habit tracker, share progress, immediate reward, visible progress markers
- Common issue: Students design elaborate systems they won't maintain
  - Push for simplest viable approach: "What's the easiest way to make this work?"

**Checkpoint 3 (2 min):**
- Share habit stacks with neighbor
- Check: Is cue specific (time + location)? Is new habit realistic?
- Tutor spot-checks for quality

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may default to group study habits; implementation intentions should fit their personal schedule, not peer pressure
- Social accountability can be powerful (4th Law) but shouldn't create shame: "Tell supportive friend, not judgmental peer"

---

### Activity 4: Deep Work Capacity Building Plan (20 minutes)

**Purpose:** Create realistic 12-week progression for building focused attention capacity

**Facilitation Tips:**

**Step 1: Current State (5 min)**
- Encourage radical honesty: "Most students overestimate their deep work capacity"
- Help calibrate: "How many hours yesterday did you work with ZERO distractions—no phone, no messages, single task?"
  - Typical answer: 0-2 hours (even if they studied 8 hours)
- Barriers identification:
  - Push for specific barriers, not vague: "Not 'I'm distracted' but 'I check phone every 15 minutes'"
  - Common barriers: Social media, messaging apps, noisy environment, unclear task, low motivation, fatigue

**Step 2: 12-Week Plan (10 min)**
- Newport's guideline: Most people max at 4 hours daily; world-class experts reach 5 hours max
- Progression must be gradual:
  - Weeks 1-2: Establish rhythm (consistency matters more than duration)
  - Weeks 3-4: Eliminate distractions (get protocol working)
  - Weeks 5-6: Extend duration (add 30 min to blocks)
  - Weeks 7-8: Add second block if capacity allows
  - Weeks 9-12: Refine and stabilize
- Red flags:
  - Starting too ambitious: "Week 1: 6 hours daily" (unsustainable, will fail, lose motivation)
  - No progression: Same target all 12 weeks (misses capacity building)
  - Jumping too fast: 1 hour Week 1 → 4 hours Week 2 (recipe for burnout)
- Reality check: "Is this ambitious enough to challenge you, but realistic enough you'll actually do it?"

**Step 3: Barrier Elimination (5 min)**
- Each barrier needs concrete solution (not just "I'll try harder")
- Examples:

| Barrier | Weak Solution | Strong Solution |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Phone distractions | "I'll use willpower" | "Phone in locked drawer; friend holds key until 12pm" |
| Noisy roommates | "I'll ask them to be quiet" | "Book library study room for deep work blocks; use noise-cancelling headphones" |
| Unclear what to work on | "I'll figure it out" | "Plan tomorrow's deep work tasks during evening shutdown ritual" |
| Friends messaging | "I'll ignore messages" | "Set status: 'Deep work 9-11am. Emergency? Call.' Turn off notifications." |

- Push for environmental design over willpower: "Make bad behavior hard, good behavior easy" (Clear's 3rd Law)

**Checkpoint 4 (2 min):**
- Verify plan starts small enough: Week 1 should feel achievable with 90% confidence
- Check progression is gradual: No jumps larger than 30 min/day or +1 day/week between phases

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Vietnamese students may feel pressure to match peers' study hours (social comparison)
- Emphasize: "Quality over quantity. Two hours of true deep work beats six hours of distracted studying."
- Validate different peak times: Not everyone is morning person; some excel in evening hours

---

### Peer Feedback Round (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Quality check deliverables through structured peer review

**Facilitation:**
1. Assign pairs/trios quickly (neighbor is fine)
2. Each student shares ONE deliverable (their choice)
3. Peer provides feedback using four questions from tutorial content
4. Keep time tight: 2 min presentation, 1 min feedback, 2 min recording

**Tutor Role:**
- Circulate to ensure feedback is constructive and specific
- Intervene if feedback is vague ("looks good") or overly critical
- Highlight excellent examples: "Table 3's habit stack is beautifully specific—can you share with class?"

---

### Before Next Class (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Set up implementation week and preview Week 9

**Key Messages:**
1. **Implementation is mandatory**: "This isn't theoretical. You'll test your system for 7 days."
2. **Track daily**: Emphasize tracking four metrics (rituals, deep work hours, habit completion, energy)
3. **Expect adjustments**: "Your system will need refinement. That's normal and expected."
4. **Reflection matters**: End-of-week reflection feeds PDP; this is where learning happens

**Week 9 Preview:**
- Topic: Stress Management & Resilience
- Connects to energy management: Stress depletes energy; resilience restores it
- Readings include mindfulness (Kabat-Zinn) and coping strategies (Lazarus & Folkman)

**Final Q&A:**
- Open floor for any clarification questions
- Remind: "These four deliverables go directly into your PDP. Invest time now, save time later."

## Common Student Questions & Suggested Responses

| Question | Suggested Response |
|----------|-------------------|
| "What if I can't maintain deep work every day?" | "Start where you are. If 5 days/week is realistic, schedule that. Build from there. Newport says consistency matters more than perfection." |
| "My schedule is too unpredictable for time-blocking" | "Time-blocking is most valuable when schedules are chaotic. When disrupted, re-block remaining hours. It's adaptive planning, not rigid control." |
| "I've tried habits before and failed" | "Lally's research shows missing one day doesn't derail formation. The median is 66 days—it takes time. Past 'failures' may have been unrealistic expectations or insufficient systems (that's why we're applying Four Laws)." |
| "These frameworks contradict each other" (e.g., Pomodoro breaks vs. deep work) | "They integrate. Use Pomodoro WITHIN deep work blocks—six 25-min pomodoros in a 3-hour block with breaks. Frameworks layer together." |
| "I don't have time for renewal rituals" | "Schwartz's research shows renewal rituals INCREASE productive time by restoring energy. You can't afford NOT to include them. Start with 5-min rituals." |
| "My friends will think I'm antisocial if I protect deep work time" | "Protecting focus time doesn't mean being unavailable. Block social time too. Boundaries make you more present when you DO engage." |
| "I'm already doing all this" (rare but happens) | "Excellent. Then use tutorial to formalize your system and identify incremental improvements. Can you add one renewal ritual or increase deep work capacity by 30 min?" |

## Assessment of Learning (Formative)

**During Tutorial:**

Observe for these indicators of understanding:

| Learning Objective | Evidence of Understanding | Evidence of Struggle |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Energy audit & renewal | Rates dimensions with specific evidence; designs scheduled rituals with clear triggers | All ratings same (no nuance); vague rituals ("exercise more") |
| 2. Time-blocking & prioritization | Identifies true Q2 priorities; protects 10+ hours deep work; includes all life categories | Everything in Q1 ("urgent"); no Q2 time; no buffer or sleep scheduled |
| 3. Habit stacking | Implementation intentions include time + location; current habit is truly automatic | Vague ("after class" without specifics); new habit too ambitious |
| 4. Deep work capacity | Honest current assessment (usually 0-2 hours); gradual 12-week progression | Overestimates current capacity; Week 1 starts too ambitious; no progression design |
| 5. Integration | Can explain how frameworks connect; system feels coherent | Treats each framework as isolated; can't see relationships |

**Intervention Strategies:**

If student struggles with:
- **Specificity**: Ask: "If I followed your instruction, what exactly would I do at 9am Monday?"
- **Realism**: Ask: "On a 1-10 scale, how confident are you that you'll maintain this for 66 days?"
- **Integration**: Ask: "How does your habit stack support your Quadrant 2 priorities?"

---

## Troubleshooting: Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student has no Quadrant 2 priorities

**Symptoms:** All tasks labeled Q1 (urgent) or claims "everything is urgent"

**Diagnosis:** Living in reactive mode; may have poor planning or unclear goals

**Intervention:**
1. Ask: "What would happen if you delayed this task one week?" (If answer is "nothing catastrophic"→ Q2)
2. Reframe: "What tasks would build your capacity long-term?" (Thesis research, skill development → Q2)
3. If truly overwhelmed: "Let's list everything, then identify what could shift to next week"

---

### Challenge 2: Unrealistic deep work capacity expectations

**Symptoms:** Plans 6-8 hours daily deep work from Week 1

**Diagnosis:** Underestimates cognitive demands of sustained focus; may be confusing "study time" with "deep work"

**Intervention:**
1. Calibrate: "Yesterday, how many hours did you work with ZERO distractions?" (Usually 0-2)
2. Cite Newport: "Most people max at 4 hours daily; world-class experts reach 5. Start at 1-2 hours."
3. Reframe: "We're building capacity like training for marathon—start with 5km, not 42km"

---

### Challenge 3: Vague implementation intentions

**Symptoms:** "After class, I'll study" or "I'll exercise more"

**Diagnosis:** Doesn't understand specificity requirement; may not have clear current habits to stack on

**Intervention:**
1. Test: "Could a stranger follow your instruction exactly?"
2. Add specifics: "Which class? What time does it end? Where will you go? Which desk? What will you study?"
3. Formula check: "After [time + location + specific action], I will [specific new behavior]"

---

### Challenge 4: Overcomplicating systems

**Symptoms:** Designs elaborate tracking spreadsheets, multiple apps, complex rituals

**Diagnosis:** Perfectionism; may be procrastinating actual implementation

**Intervention:**
1. Apply Clear's 3rd Law: "What's the SIMPLEST version that would work?"
2. Two-minute rule: "Can you start this in under 2 minutes?"
3. Reality check: "Will you actually maintain this in Week 8 when you have three deadlines?"

---

### Challenge 5: Cultural conflict with boundaries

**Symptoms:** Vietnamese student unable to set boundaries with family/friends for deep work time

**Diagnosis:** Collectivist values create guilt around saying "no" or being "unavailable"

**Intervention:**
1. Reframe: "Protecting your study time helps you succeed, which honors your family's investment in your education"
2. Communication strategy: "You're not saying 'I'm unavailable.' You're saying 'I'll call you at 3pm after my study block'"
3. Find cultural alignment: "Vietnamese value education highly—deep work helps you excel academically"

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Students Ahead

**Indicators:** Already practices time-blocking, familiar with frameworks, wants advanced challenges

**Extensions:**
1. "Design bimodal schedule for exam week: entire days dedicated to single subject"
2. "Create habit stacks for academic AND professional development (networking, side projects)"
3. "How would you teach this system to freshman roommate? Design peer mentoring approach"

### For Students Struggling

**Indicators:** Overwhelmed, no existing routines, low confidence

**Scaffolds:**
1. Simplify: "Choose ONE framework to implement this week (recommend habit stacking). Add others later."
2. Start micro: "Habit stack a 2-minute behavior. Example: After sitting at desk, spend 2 minutes organizing study materials."
3. Provide template: Share completed example deliverables (see Appendix) to model expectations

### For ESL Students

**Support Strategies:**
1. Vocabulary: Clarify "renewal rituals," "implementation intentions," "attention residue"
2. Examples: Provide Vietnamese cultural context examples (family meal as emotional energy ritual)
3. Check understanding: "Can you explain this framework to your neighbor in your own words?"

### Example 3: Habit Stacking Plan

| # | After [CURRENT HABIT]... | I will [NEW HABIT]... | Location | Duration | Four Laws Applied |
|---|--------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | After I sit down at library desk at 8am | I will put phone in backpack front pocket and close it | Library study room 3 | 30 seconds | 1st: Obvious (desk arrival = cue); 3rd: Easy (prepared spot); 4th: Satisfying (feels committed) |
| 2 | After I close laptop at end of management lecture (12:00) | I will spend 10 minutes reviewing notes and writing 3 key takeaways | Same lecture hall, back row | 10 min | 1st: Obvious (laptop close = cue); 2nd: Attractive (helps exam prep); 3rd: Easy (materials already out) |
| 3 | After I put head on pillow at 11pm | I will practice box breathing for 5 minutes (4-4-4-4 count) | Bed | 5 min | 1st: Obvious (bedtime routine); 2nd: Attractive (helps sleep); 4th: Satisfying (feel relaxed) |

---

### Example 4: Deep Work Capacity Building Plan

**Current State:** 1 hour/day, 3 days/week = 3 hours/week

**Barriers:**
1. Phone constantly buzzes → Solution: Phone in friend's locker during blocks
2. Library noisy → Solution: Book quiet study room via app
3. Unclear what to work on → Solution: Plan tasks during evening block-planning ritual

**12-Week Progression:**

| Weeks | Daily Target | Days/Week | Total/Week | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1-2 | 1.5 hours | 5 days | 7.5 hours | Establish 8-9:30am rhythm, test phone protocol |
| 3-4 | 2 hours | 5 days | 10 hours | Master study room booking, minimize distractions |
| 5-6 | 2.5 hours | 5 days | 12.5 hours | Extend morning block to 10am |
| 7-8 | 3 hours | 5 days | 15 hours | Add afternoon 2-3pm block twice/week |
| 9-10 | 3 hours | 6 days | 18 hours | Stabilize two blocks daily (morning priority, afternoon 3×/week) |
| 11-12 | 3.5 hours | 6 days | 21 hours | Fine-tune, assess capacity limit |

**Tracking:** Daily log in Google Calendar—color code actual deep work hours achieved
