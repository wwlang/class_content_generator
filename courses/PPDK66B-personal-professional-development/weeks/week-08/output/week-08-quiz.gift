// Questions: 12

$CATEGORY: PPDK66B - Week 8

::Energy Management (Schwartz)::According to Schwartz and McCarthy's (2007) HBR article, what are the four dimensions of energy that individuals should manage?{
=Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual #Correct! Schwartz identifies four energy dimensions\: Physical (body—sleep, nutrition, breaks), Emotional (feelings—positive emotions, resilience), Mental (focus—concentration, single-tasking), and Spiritual (purpose—meaning, values alignment).
~Time, Money, Relationships, and Health #Incorrect. These are general life domains, not Schwartz's energy dimensions. His framework specifically focuses on Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual energy.
~Sleep, Nutrition, Exercise, and Meditation #Incorrect. These are practices for managing Physical energy, but they don't represent all four dimensions. Schwartz's framework includes Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual dimensions as well.
~Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral, and Social #Incorrect. This is a different psychological framework. Schwartz's four dimensions are Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual.
####In your <b>Personal Development Plan</b>, you'll conduct an energy audit across all four dimensions. Most students initially focus only on physical energy (sleep, nutrition), but emotional, mental, and spiritual energy are equally important. See Week 8 slides 4-8.}

::Energy Management (Schwartz)::A student reports feeling constantly exhausted despite sleeping 8 hours nightly. They skip meals, study 10 hours daily without breaks, and feel their coursework lacks meaning. Using Schwartz's energy management framework, which dimensions are most likely depleted?{
~Only Physical energy is depleted due to poor nutrition #Incorrect. While Physical energy is compromised by skipping meals, the scenario also describes Mental depletion (no breaks) and Spiritual depletion (lack of meaning).
=Physical, Mental, and Spiritual energy are depleted; Emotional energy appears stable #Correct! Physical energy is compromised by skipping meals. Mental energy is depleted by 10 hours of continuous study without breaks. Spiritual energy is low due to lack of perceived meaning. The scenario doesn't provide information about emotional state.
~All four dimensions are depleted and require intervention #Incorrect. While three dimensions show clear depletion, we cannot conclude Emotional energy is depleted without evidence of emotional distress or negative feelings.
~Mental energy only; sleep indicates Physical energy is adequate #Incorrect. Adequate sleep alone doesn't ensure full Physical energy—nutrition and movement matter too. Additionally, the lack of meaning indicates Spiritual depletion.
####You can't compensate for depleted energy in one dimension by oversupplying another. More sleep won't fix poor nutrition. In your time-blocked schedule, ensure you've included renewal rituals for each depleted dimension. See Week 8 slides 9-12.}

::Energy Management (Schwartz)::According to Albulescu et al.'s (2022) meta-analysis on micro-breaks, what is the primary mechanism by which short breaks improve performance?{
~Breaks allow more time to complete tasks #Incorrect. Breaks actually reduce working time. The benefit comes from strategic recovery, not additional time.
=Breaks replenish vigor and restore cognitive resources through strategic recovery #Correct! The meta-analysis of 22 studies found that micro-breaks improve performance by replenishing cognitive resources and vigor—not by adding time or reducing work.
~Breaks prevent boredom by adding variety to the workday #Incorrect. While variety may be a side benefit, the primary mechanism is cognitive resource restoration, not boredom prevention.
~Breaks reduce the total amount of work required #Incorrect. Breaks don't reduce work—they make you more effective at completing work through strategic recovery.
####Many students resist taking breaks, viewing them as "wasted time." This research proves the opposite\: strategic breaks make you MORE productive by preventing cognitive depletion. See Week 8 slides 13-15.}

::Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix)::In the Eisenhower Matrix, what are the four quadrants based on?{
=Urgent vs. Not Urgent and Important vs. Not Important #Correct! The Eisenhower Matrix uses two dimensions\: Urgency (does it require immediate attention?) and Importance (does it align with long-term goals and values?).
~Difficult vs. Easy and Time-Consuming vs. Quick #Incorrect. The matrix is not about difficulty or time investment—it's about urgency (requires immediate attention) and importance (aligns with goals).
~Short-term vs. Long-term and Personal vs. Professional #Incorrect. The matrix doesn't distinguish between personal and professional tasks. It categorizes by urgency and importance.
~High-value vs. Low-value and Enjoyable vs. Unpleasant #Incorrect. Enjoyment is not a factor in the matrix. The dimensions are urgency and importance.
####The four quadrants are\: Q1 (Urgent & Important—crises), Q2 (Not Urgent but Important—strategic work), Q3 (Urgent but Not Important—interruptions), Q4 (Neither—time wasters). High performers protect Quadrant 2 time. See Week 8 slide 16.}

::Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix)::A student receives a text from a classmate asking for help proofreading their assignment, which is due tomorrow. The student has planned to work on thesis research (due in 3 weeks) during this time block. Using the Eisenhower Matrix, how should this request be categorized and handled?{
~Quadrant 1 (Urgent & Important)—drop everything to help because it's urgent #Incorrect. The request is urgent for the classmate, but not important to the student's own goals. This is the trap of confusing others' urgency with your priorities.
~Quadrant 2 (Not Urgent but Important)—schedule help for later in the week #Incorrect. Helping a classmate with their assignment is not important to the student's own goal achievement. It's Q3, not Q2.
=Quadrant 3 (Urgent but Not Important)—politely decline or minimize time spent, protect thesis research time #Correct! This is classic Q3\: urgent for the classmate but not important to the student's own goals. The thesis research (Q2) should be protected.
~Quadrant 4 (Neither Urgent nor Important)—ignore the request completely #Incorrect. The request does have urgency (deadline tomorrow), even if it's not the student's own urgency. It's Q3, not Q4.
####Vietnamese students often struggle with Q3 requests due to strong social obligations. Protecting Q2 time doesn't mean being unavailable—it means being strategically available. See Week 8 slides 17-18.}

::Prioritization (Time-Blocking)::According to Newport's time-blocking methodology, what should you do when an unexpected interruption disrupts your scheduled blocks?{
~Abandon time-blocking for the day since the schedule is already broken #Incorrect. The power of time-blocking is not the original schedule but the practice of intentional time allocation. Disruptions are expected.
~Continue with the original schedule regardless of the disruption #Incorrect. Ignoring disruptions defeats the purpose. Time-blocking should be adaptive, responding to reality while maintaining intentionality.
=Re-block the remaining hours of the day, adjusting for the disruption #Correct! Newport emphasizes that time-blocking is adaptive, not rigid. When disrupted, pause and re-block the remaining hours based on the new reality.
~Switch to a to-do list approach until tomorrow when you can time-block again #Incorrect. Switching systems abandons intentionality. Re-blocking maintains the benefits of time-blocking even after disruption.
####Many students view time-blocking as rigid and give up when the schedule breaks. The power is not the original schedule but the practice of intentional time allocation through conscious re-planning. See Week 8 slides 19-20.}

::Deep Work (Newport)::What is Newport's formula for high-quality work produced?{
~High-Quality Work \= (Time Spent)² #Incorrect. Squaring time spent doesn't capture the focus component. Newport's formula includes intensity of focus as a multiplier.
=High-Quality Work \= Time Spent × Intensity of Focus #Correct! Newport's formula highlights that both time and focus intensity matter. Six hours of distracted work produces less than two hours of deep focus.
~High-Quality Work \= Skill Level + Time Spent #Incorrect. While skill matters, Newport's formula specifically emphasizes intensity of focus, not skill level as a variable.
~High-Quality Work \= Time Spent ÷ Number of Distractions #Incorrect. While distractions are relevant, Newport expresses the relationship as multiplication with focus intensity, not division by distractions.
####This formula challenges the assumption that "studying longer" automatically produces better outcomes. Quality output requires both duration AND concentration. See Week 8 slide 21.}

::Deep Work (Newport)::What is "attention residue" and why does it reduce performance during deep work?{
~Mental fatigue that accumulates after several hours of focused work #Incorrect. Attention residue is not about fatigue from long work sessions—it's about the cognitive cost of task switching.
=The phenomenon where part of your attention remains on a previous task after switching, reducing performance on the current task #Correct! Based on Sophie Leroy's research, attention residue occurs when you switch tasks—part of your cognitive capacity remains processing the previous task.
~Physical tiredness from sitting too long without breaks #Incorrect. Attention residue is a cognitive phenomenon, not physical tiredness. It relates to task-switching, not duration.
~The inability to remember what you were working on after an interruption #Incorrect. Attention residue is not about forgetting—it's about your brain still processing the previous task while you try to focus on the new one.
####Each task switch carries an attention cost. Your brain is still partly processing the message even after you've returned to the essay. This is why multitasking is cognitively expensive. See Week 8 slides 22-23.}

::Deep Work (Newport)::A student wants to build deep work capacity but currently can only focus for 45 minutes before losing concentration. According to Newport's guidance, what is the most appropriate initial goal?{
~Immediately aim for 4 hours daily since that's the maximum for most people #Incorrect. Jumping to 4 hours immediately leads to burnout and failure. Deep work capacity must be built gradually.
=Start with 1-2 hours daily and gradually build capacity over 12 weeks #Correct! Newport advises that deep work capacity is like a muscle—it must be built gradually. Starting from 45 minutes, 1-2 hours daily is appropriate.
~Focus on extending single sessions to 3 hours before adding a second daily block #Incorrect. Attempting 3-hour sessions immediately from 45 minutes is too aggressive. Gradual progression is more sustainable.
~Work as long as possible each day without setting specific time goals #Incorrect. Specific time goals with gradual progression are essential. Working without structure doesn't build systematic capacity.
####Deep work capacity maxes at 4 hours daily for most people (world-class experts reach 5 hours). The rhythmic philosophy (same time daily) helps build automaticity. See Week 8 slides 24-25.}

::Habit Formation (Lally)::According to Lally et al.'s (2010) peer-reviewed study, what is the median time for habit formation?{
~21 days #Incorrect. The '21 days' figure is a popular myth. Lally's research found habit formation takes much longer.
~30 days #Incorrect. 30 days is another common misconception. The actual median is significantly longer.
=66 days #Correct! Lally's study found habit formation takes 18-254 days with a median of 66 days—approximately two months.
~90 days #Incorrect. While some habits take this long (the range was 18-254 days), the median is 66 days.
####This debunks the popular "21 days" myth. Key finding\: Missing one opportunity did not significantly derail habit formation; long-term consistency matters more than perfection. See Week 8 slide 26.}

::Habit Formation (Clear)::A student designs the following habit stack\: "After I arrive at campus, I will go to the library and study." Using Gollwitzer's implementation intentions research and Clear's habit stacking principles, what is the primary weakness of this plan?{
~The current habit ('arrive at campus') is not specific enough regarding time and triggers #Incorrect. While this is one weakness, the behavior ('study') is also vague. Both the cue and the behavior lack specificity.
~The new habit ('study') is too vague and doesn't specify what to study or for how long #Incorrect. While true, the cue ('arrive at campus') is also vague. Both elements need specificity.
=Both the cue and the behavior lack the specificity required for effective implementation intentions #Correct! 'Arrive at campus' could be 8am or 2pm. 'Study' doesn't specify subject, materials, or duration. Implementation intentions require specificity in both cue AND behavior.
~The plan doesn't include a reward, violating Clear's 4th Law #Incorrect. While rewards help, the primary weakness is the lack of specificity in both the cue and the behavior, not the absence of a reward.
####A stronger version\: "After I enter library main entrance at 8am Monday/Wednesday/Friday, I will go to Desk 12 and review lecture notes for 15 minutes." Gollwitzer's meta-analysis shows specificity is critical (d \= 0.65). See Week 8 slides 27-28.}

::Habit Formation (Clear)::A student wants to build a habit of exercising before their first class at 9am. Using Clear's Four Laws, which of the following strategies correctly applies the "3rd Law\: Make it Easy"?{
~Join a gym with friends so exercise becomes more socially attractive #Incorrect. This applies the 2nd Law (Make it Attractive), not the 3rd Law. Social motivation relates to attractiveness.
=Set out exercise clothes, shoes, and water bottle the night before to reduce morning friction #Correct! The 3rd Law (Make it Easy) focuses on reducing friction. Preparing the environment the night before eliminates morning decision-making and obstacles.
~Track completed workouts on a visible calendar to create satisfaction #Incorrect. This applies the 4th Law (Make it Satisfying), not the 3rd Law. Tracking creates reward/satisfaction.
~Set a phone alarm for 7am as a reminder to exercise #Incorrect. This applies the 1st Law (Make it Obvious), not the 3rd Law. Alarms create cues/reminders.
####The 3rd Law is powerful because it doesn't rely on willpower in the moment—you design the environment when motivation is high (evening before) so execution is inevitable when willpower is low (tired morning). See Week 8 slides 29-30.}
