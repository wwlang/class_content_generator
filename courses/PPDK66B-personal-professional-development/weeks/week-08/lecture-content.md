# Time, Energy & Habit Management

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 8. Today we explore one of the most practical topics in the course: how to manage your time, energy, and habits effectively. This content directly supports your Personal Development Plan (due Week 11), where you'll design specific productivity systems and habit stacks.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="Hook: Habit Formation Timeline">

# 66 days

**The average time to form a new habit**

*(Lally et al., 2010 - Range: 18-254 days)*

<speaker-notes>
This finding from University College London challenges the popular "21 days" myth. The key insight: habit formation takes patience and consistency, not quick fixes. Students often express relief hearing this—it removes unrealistic pressure and emphasizes sustainable change over immediate results.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** between time management and energy management paradigms, applying the appropriate approach to personal productivity challenges
2. **Apply** prioritization frameworks (Eisenhower Matrix, time-blocking) to organize tasks by urgency and importance
3. **Design** habit stacks using implementation intentions and the Four Laws of Behavior Change
4. **Evaluate** deep work strategies for maintaining focused attention in distraction-rich environments
5. **Create** a sustainable performance system balancing productivity with energy renewal across four dimensions

<speaker-notes>
These objectives align directly with your Personal Development Plan Section 5: Implementation & Accountability. Today provides the frameworks you'll use to design your daily/weekly systems. Emphasize that these aren't theoretical—they're tools for immediate application.

## Today's Journey

**Part 1:** Time vs. Energy Management (15 min)
**Part 2:** Prioritization & Deep Work (20 min)
**Part 3:** The Science of Habit Formation (25 min)
**Part 4:** Building Your Productivity System (20 min)

<speaker-notes>
This roadmap shows four distinct segments with clear transitions. We'll move from paradigm shift (time → energy) to tactical frameworks (prioritization, deep work) to behavioral science (habits) to integration (your personalized system). Return to this slide at each transition to help students track progress.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Part 1: Time vs. Energy Management">

## Part 1: Time vs. Energy Management

**The Paradigm Shift**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "Let's begin with a fundamental question that most productivity advice gets wrong: What should you actually manage—your time or your energy?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" title="The Time Management Trap">

## The Time Management Trap

**Traditional Approach:**
- "I need better time management"
- Focus on schedules, calendars, to-do lists
- Assumes all hours are equal
- Goal: Do more in less time

**The Problem:**
- Time is finite—everyone has 24 hours
- Working longer ≠ working better
- Ignores human energy fluctuations
- Leads to burnout despite "efficiency"

<speaker-notes>
Most students arrive with time management mindset—they want tips to "do more." This slide challenges that assumption. Key point: Time management alone fails because it treats humans like machines with constant output. Students often relate to the burnout experience of "being productive" yet feeling exhausted.

Connection to Vietnam context: Vietnamese students face heavy course loads and often work part-time. They need energy management, not just time management, to sustain performance across all commitments.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="The Energy Management Paradigm">

## The Energy Management Paradigm

**New Approach (Schwartz & McCarthy, 2007):**
- Energy is **renewable**, time is not
- Manage energy across **four dimensions**:
  1. **Physical** - Body health, sleep, nutrition
  2. **Emotional** - Feelings, stress, positivity
  3. **Mental** - Focus, attention, concentration
  4. **Spiritual** - Purpose, values, meaning

**Key Insight:** High performance comes from rhythmic renewal, not relentless expenditure.

<speaker-notes>
This is the paradigm shift from Schwartz's HBR article. The Wachovia Bank case study showed employees who managed energy (not just time) significantly outperformed control groups on financial metrics.

Explain each dimension briefly:
- Physical: Your body's energy level—affected by sleep, exercise, nutrition
- Emotional: Your emotional state—stress drains energy; positivity replenishes it
- Mental: Your cognitive capacity—attention is finite and gets depleted
- Spiritual: Your sense of purpose—work aligned with values energizes; misalignment drains

Students often find the "spiritual" dimension unfamiliar—clarify it's about meaning and purpose, not religion.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Applying Energy Management">

## Applying Energy Management: Four Strategies

| Dimension | Depletion Causes | Renewal Strategies |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Physical** | Poor sleep, no breaks, bad nutrition | 7-9 hrs sleep, breaks every 90-120 min, healthy meals |
| **Emotional** | Stress, negativity, conflict | Gratitude practice, positive interactions, boundaries |
| **Mental** | Distractions, multitasking, decision fatigue | Deep work blocks, single-tasking, limit choices |
| **Spiritual** | Meaningless work, values misalignment | Connect to purpose, values-aligned goals, impact focus |

<speaker-notes>
This table translates theory into practice. Walk through each dimension with examples:

Physical: Vietnamese students often sacrifice sleep for study—emphasize that sleep deprivation reduces learning efficiency, creating a negative cycle.

Emotional: In high-pressure academic environments, emotional energy management is often neglected. Simple practices like expressing gratitude or connecting with supportive friends make measurable differences.

Mental: Digital distractions (social media, phones) are the primary mental energy drain. We'll explore solutions in the Deep Work section.

Spiritual: Students preparing career plans should ask "Does this goal align with my values?" Misaligned goals drain motivation even if achievable.

Assessment connection: "In your PDP, you'll conduct an energy audit across these four dimensions and design specific renewal rituals."
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="10" layout="section-break" title="Part 2: Prioritization & Deep Work">

## Part 2: Prioritization & Deep Work

**How to Focus on What Matters**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "Now that we understand energy management, let's explore HOW to allocate that energy effectively. Not all tasks deserve equal attention."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="The Eisenhower Matrix">

## The Eisenhower Matrix

|  | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
|---|---|---|
| **Important** | **Q1: Crisis Management**<br>Do First<br>*(Deadlines, emergencies)* | **Q2: Strategic Work**<br>Schedule<br>*(Planning, relationship-building, skill development)* |
| **Not Important** | **Q3: Distractions**<br>Delegate<br>*(Interruptions, some emails)* | **Q4: Time Wasters**<br>Eliminate<br>*(Mindless scrolling, busywork)* |

**Goal:** Maximize Q2 (important but not urgent) to prevent Q1 crises.

<speaker-notes>
The Eisenhower Matrix is attributed to President Dwight D. Eisenhower's prioritization approach, though evidence of direct use is limited. Conceptually sound but lacks strong empirical validation.

Walk through each quadrant:

Q1 (Urgent + Important): Crisis mode—exam tomorrow, client emergency. Stressful but necessary.

Q2 (Not Urgent + Important): This is where high performers live. Examples: exercising regularly, building mentor relationships, planning your PDP early. These prevent Q1 crises but get neglected because they lack deadline pressure.

Q3 (Urgent + Not Important): The trap—feels urgent but doesn't advance your goals. Examples: replying to non-critical messages immediately, attending unnecessary meetings.

Q4 (Not Urgent + Not Important): Pure waste—mindless social media scrolling.

Key teaching point: Most students live in Q1 (cramming) and Q4 (distraction). The goal is to shift time to Q2, which requires intentional scheduling.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Time-Blocking Method">

## Time-Blocking Method

**Definition:** Schedule every hour of your day in advance, allocating specific time blocks to specific tasks.

**Cal Newport's Approach (Deep Work):**
- Plan each day the night before or morning of
- Block out work hours in 30-60 minute chunks
- Assign specific tasks to each block
- Schedule breaks, emails, admin work
- Protect "deep work" blocks from interruption

**Example:**
- 6:00-7:00 AM: Exercise (Physical energy renewal)
- 9:00-11:00 AM: **Deep Work Block** - Study for Finance exam
- 11:00-11:15 AM: Break
- 11:15 AM-12:30 PM: Attend class
- 2:00-3:00 PM: Reply to emails, admin tasks

<speaker-notes>
Time-blocking is Newport's core productivity method from *Deep Work*. It combines Eisenhower's prioritization with calendar commitment.

Important nuances:
- Time-blocking isn't rigid scheduling—it's intentional planning. If disruptions occur, revise your plan mid-day.
- The act of planning is valuable even if the plan changes. It forces you to consider priorities explicitly rather than reacting.
- Schedule EVERYTHING, including breaks and free time. Unscheduled time defaults to distraction.

Common student objection: "My schedule is too unpredictable." Response: "That's exactly why planning matters—you make conscious choices about how to use unexpected free time rather than defaulting to your phone."

Research note: Time-blocking lacks strong empirical validation but is theoretically grounded in goal-setting and implementation intentions research (which IS strongly validated).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="framework" title="Deep Work Defined">

## Deep Work: The Superpower

**Definition (Newport, 2016):**
"Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit."

**Formula:**
**High-Quality Work = Time Spent × Intensity of Focus**

**Examples:**
- Writing your Personal Development Plan with full concentration
- Studying complex financial models without checking phone
- Practicing a presentation until it's polished
- Analyzing case studies deeply

**Opposite:** Shallow work—non-cognitively demanding tasks (emails, admin, social media).

<speaker-notes>
Deep work is Newport's central concept. The formula is crucial: doubling your focus intensity has the same effect as doubling time spent. Most students spend 3 hours "studying" with constant interruptions when 1 hour of deep work would be more effective.

Examples relevant to students:
- Deep work: Reading and annotating research articles for 90 minutes without distraction
- Shallow work: Attending to emails, formatting documents, administrative tasks

Key insight: Both are necessary, but deep work drives learning and performance. Schedule deep work during your peak energy hours (often mornings for most people).

Vietnamese context: Coffee shop study culture often involves shallow work disguised as productivity—socializing, phone checking, constant interruptions. Deep work requires intentional environment design (quiet space, no phone, clear task).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Attention Residue Problem">

## Attention Residue: Why Multitasking Fails

**Concept:** When you switch tasks, part of your attention remains stuck on the previous task.

**Sophie Leroy's Research (2009):**
- Switching between tasks leaves "residue" from the previous task
- This residue reduces performance on the new task
- Effect is stronger when previous task is incomplete or interrupted
- Recovery time: 15-25 minutes to regain full focus

**Implications:**
- Check email 3× daily (scheduled times) vs. constantly
- Batch similar tasks together (Q3 tasks in one block)
- Close all tabs/apps not related to current deep work

<speaker-notes>
Attention residue explains why students "study" for hours but retain little. Each phone check, message reply, or tab switch leaves cognitive residue, reducing learning effectiveness.

Key teaching point: This isn't about willpower—it's about understanding how attention works. Your brain needs time to fully transition between tasks. Constant switching creates a permanent state of partial attention.

Practical advice:
- Put phone in another room during deep work blocks
- Use browser extensions to block distracting sites
- Close all browser tabs except those needed for current task
- Tell roommates/family "I'm unavailable 9-11 AM"

Connect to energy management: Mental energy dimension is most affected by attention residue. Constant task-switching depletes mental energy faster than sustained focus on one task.

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Part 3: The Science of Habit Formation">

## Part 3: The Science of Habit Formation

**Building Systems That Last**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "We've covered how to prioritize and focus. Now let's make those behaviors automatic through habit formation. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Habit Formation Timeline">

## How Long Does It Really Take?

**Popular Myth:** "21 days to form a habit"

**Scientific Reality (Lally et al., 2010):**
- **Median:** 66 days to reach automaticity
- **Range:** 18 to 254 days depending on:
  - Habit complexity (drinking water vs. running 30 min)
  - Individual differences
  - Consistency of practice

**Key Finding:** Missing one opportunity did NOT significantly affect habit formation.

**Implication:** Build habits with patience and self-compassion, not rigid perfection.

<speaker-notes>
This study from University College London tracked 96 participants forming new habits. The asymptotic curve shows habit strength increases rapidly at first, then plateaus.

Key teaching moments:

1. **Debunk 21-day myth**: This originated from a 1960 book without empirical support. Lally's research provides actual data.

2. **Individual variation**: Some participants automated drinking water after meals in 18 days; others took 254 days to automate exercise routines. Don't compare your timeline to others.

3. **Missing one day is OK**: Students often abandon habits after one missed day, thinking they've "failed." Lally found one missed opportunity doesn't derail the process—consistency matters more than perfection.

Connection to PDP: "When you design habit stacks in your Personal Development Plan, expect 60-90 days before they feel automatic. Don't give up at Day 30 because it still feels effortful—that's normal."

Vietnamese context: Cultural emphasis on discipline can create all-or-nothing thinking. Emphasize sustainable consistency over perfect streaks.

<slide number="17" layout="framework" title="The Four Laws of Behavior Change">

## James Clear's Four Laws

**Building Good Habits:**

| Law | Stage | Make It... | Example |
|-----|-------|------------|---------|
| **1st Law** | Cue | **Obvious** | Put workout clothes next to bed |
| **2nd Law** | Craving | **Attractive** | Pair studying with favorite coffee |
| **3rd Law** | Response | **Easy** | Start with 2 push-ups, not 50 |
| **4th Law** | Reward | **Satisfying** | Track progress visually |

**Breaking Bad Habits:** *Invert each law*
- Make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, unsatisfying

<speaker-notes>
Clear's Four Laws framework from *Atomic Habits* synthesizes decades of behavior change research into practical principles.

Walk through each law with examples:

**1st Law (Cue - Make it Obvious):**
- Environment design is crucial. If you want to drink more water, place a water bottle on your desk.
- Vietnamese example: Put your English vocabulary flashcards next to your breakfast spot to review while eating.

**2nd Law (Craving - Make it Attractive):**
- Temptation bundling: "I will only listen to this podcast while exercising."
- Connect habits to identity: "I'm the kind of person who reads daily" is more motivating than "I should read."

**3rd Law (Response - Make it Easy):**
- Reduce friction. If going to the gym takes 30 minutes, you won't do it. Home workouts remove that friction.
- Start tiny: 2 push-ups > 0 push-ups. Build confidence before increasing intensity.

**4th Law (Reward - Make it Satisfying):**
- Immediate rewards reinforce behavior. Track your habit streak visually (X on calendar).
- The behavior itself may not be immediately rewarding (studying is hard), so add external rewards.

Common student mistake: Trying to build multiple hard habits simultaneously. Recommend: Start with ONE habit using all Four Laws, automate it (66+ days), then add the next.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Implementation Intentions">

## Implementation Intentions: The "If-Then" Strategy

**Format:** "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y."

**Research (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006):**
- Meta-analysis of 94 studies
- Medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.65)
- Works by pre-deciding behavior, eliminating in-the-moment willpower struggle

**Examples:**
- "When I sit down at my desk, I will put my phone in the drawer."
- "If I feel stressed, I will take 5 deep breaths before responding."
- "When I finish dinner, I will immediately review my flashcards for 10 minutes."

**Why It Works:** Removes decision fatigue by creating automatic "if-then" links.

<speaker-notes>
Implementation intentions are one of the most robustly validated behavior change strategies in psychology. Gollwitzer's research spans 30+ years across 642 independent tests.

Key mechanism: Pre-committing to behavior in specific situations means you don't need willpower in the moment. The decision is already made.

Teaching approach:
1. Explain the format: "When [SITUATION], I will [BEHAVIOR]"
2. Emphasize specificity: Vague intentions fail. "I'll study more" fails; "When I finish breakfast at 7:30 AM, I will study Finance for 90 minutes" succeeds.
3. Write it down: Implementation intentions work best when externalized (written or typed).

Connect to PDP: "In your Implementation & Accountability section, you'll write implementation intentions for each habit. Use the exact 'When X, I will Y' formula—don't paraphrase."

Vietnamese context: Implementation intentions bridge the gap between good intentions (which Vietnamese students have in abundance) and actual behavior. The structure removes ambiguity about when/where to act.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="framework" title="Habit Stacking Formula">

## Habit Stacking: Building on What Exists

**Formula (James Clear):**
"After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

**Why It Works:**
- Leverages existing neural pathways
- Uses current habits as cues for new habits
- Creates natural sequences with minimal friction

**Examples:**
- "After I pour my morning coffee, I will write three things I'm grateful for."
- "After I close my laptop at 9 PM, I will prepare tomorrow's outfit."
- "After I finish lunch, I will walk for 10 minutes."

**Your Turn:** Stack a study habit onto an existing routine.

<speaker-notes>
Habit stacking is an application of implementation intentions, specifically using existing habits as situational cues.

Key advantage: You don't need to remember a new time/place trigger. The existing habit serves as a reliable cue because it's already automatic.

Teaching approach:
1. Identify existing reliable habits (morning coffee, brushing teeth, arriving home, finishing dinner).
2. Choose a new habit you want to build.
3. Stack the new habit immediately after the existing one.
4. Emphasize "after," not "during"—clear sequence matters.

Common mistakes:
- Stacking too many habits at once: Start with one stack, automate it, then add more.
- Choosing unstable anchors: "After I exercise" fails if exercise isn't consistent yet. Use rock-solid habits as anchors.

Interactive moment: "Take 30 seconds right now. Identify one existing habit and one new habit you want to build. Write your habit stack: 'After [EXISTING], I will [NEW].' We'll share a few examples."

Connect to PDP: "Section 5 of your PDP should include 3-5 habit stacks using this exact formula. These become your daily implementation system."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="The Habit Loop">

## The Habit Loop: Cue → Routine → Reward

**Neurological Pattern (Duhigg, 2012):**

```
CUE → ROUTINE → REWARD
```

**Example: Checking Phone**
- **Cue:** Notification sound / boredom
- **Routine:** Pick up phone, scroll social media
- **Reward:** Dopamine hit from novelty

**To Change Habits:**
1. **Keep the cue**
2. **Replace the routine**
3. **Maintain the reward**

**Example Fix:**
- **Cue:** Boredom (keep)
- **New Routine:** Walk outside for 5 minutes (change)
- **Reward:** Mental break + physical movement (maintain)

<speaker-notes>
The habit loop model comes from Charles Duhigg's *The Power of Habit*, based on MIT neuroscience research on basal ganglia patterns.

Key insight: Habits are neurological loops. You can't simply delete a habit—you must replace the routine while maintaining the reward structure.

Teaching example - Phone addiction:
1. Identify the actual reward: Is it social connection? Boredom relief? Status checking? The reward matters.
2. Find alternative routines that provide the same reward: Boredom relief can come from a short walk, stretching, or calling a friend.
3. Keep the cue detectable but replace the automatic response.

Interactive activity (if time): "Think of one habit you want to change. Identify: What's the cue? What's the reward you're actually seeking? What's an alternative routine that provides that reward more healthfully?"

Vietnamese context: Social media usage is extremely high among Vietnamese students (average 6+ hours daily). Understanding the habit loop helps students recognize they're seeking specific rewards (connection, validation, distraction) that could be met through alternative routines.

Connect to Clear's Four Laws: The habit loop is the underlying mechanism; the Four Laws are the intervention strategies.

## Part 4: Building Your Productivity System

**Integration & Application**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "We've explored energy management, prioritization, deep work, and habit formation as separate concepts. Now let's integrate them into a cohesive personal productivity system you can implement immediately and refine in your PDP."
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="22" title="Your Weekly Energy Audit">

## Conduct Your Energy Audit

**Schwartz's Four Dimensions Self-Assessment:**

| Dimension | Current State (1-10) | Energy Drains | Renewal Strategies |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Physical** | ___ | Poor sleep? Skipped meals? | Sleep schedule, meal prep, exercise plan |
| **Emotional** | ___ | Stress? Negativity? | Gratitude journal, social support, boundaries |
| **Mental** | ___ | Distractions? Multitasking? | Deep work blocks, phone limits, single-tasking |
| **Spiritual** | ___ | Meaningless work? Value misalignment? | Values clarification, purpose-driven goals |

**Action:** Rate yourself, identify top 2 drains, design 1 renewal strategy per dimension.

<speaker-notes>
This energy audit template translates Schwartz's theory into actionable self-assessment. Students will use this exact template in tutorial and later in their PDP.

How to facilitate:
1. Give students 3-5 minutes to rate themselves honestly on each dimension (1 = completely drained, 10 = fully energized).
2. For each dimension, identify specific drains (be concrete: "scrolling TikTok until 2 AM" not "bad habits").
3. Design renewal strategies using the frameworks we've learned today (habit stacking, implementation intentions, time-blocking).

Common patterns:
- Physical energy: Most students rate 4-6. Primary drains: insufficient sleep, irregular meals, sedentary lifestyle.
- Emotional energy: Often lowest (3-5) due to academic pressure and social stressors.
- Mental energy: Heavily impacted by digital distractions.
- Spiritual energy: Many students haven't considered this—"I'm just trying to get through university." Help them articulate values.

Connect to PDP: "This audit becomes the foundation of your energy management strategy in Section 5. You'll expand on each dimension with specific rituals and accountability measures."

Tutorial activity: Students will complete this audit, share with a partner, and create one concrete renewal ritual using habit stacking or implementation intentions.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="23" layout="framework" title="Sample Daily System">

## Sample Daily Productivity System

**Morning (High Mental Energy):**
- 6:00 AM: Wake, immediate exercise (Physical renewal)
- 7:00 AM: Breakfast + gratitude journal (Emotional renewal)
- 8:00-10:00 AM: **Deep Work Block 1** - Highest priority task (Q2)

**Midday (Moderate Energy):**
- 10:00-10:15 AM: Break (walk outside)
- 10:15 AM-12:00 PM: Classes or shallow work (emails, admin)
- 12:00-1:00 PM: Lunch + social connection (Emotional renewal)

**Afternoon (Recovery + Focused Work):**
- 1:00-1:30 PM: Rest or light reading (Spiritual renewal)
- 2:00-4:00 PM: **Deep Work Block 2** - Secondary priority task
- 4:00-6:00 PM: Tutorial, group work, or shallow tasks

**Evening (Wind Down):**
- 6:00 PM: Dinner + reflection on daily wins
- 7:00-8:00 PM: Personal time (hobby, relaxation)
- 9:00 PM: Plan tomorrow (time-block next day)
- 10:00 PM: Digital sunset (no screens) → Sleep by 10:30 PM

<speaker-notes>
This sample system integrates all frameworks: energy management (renewal rituals), time-blocking (scheduled hours), deep work (focused blocks), and habits (consistent routines).

Key teaching points:

**1. Align tasks with energy:**
- Deep Work Block 1 at 8 AM when mental energy peaks
- Shallow work (emails) after 10 AM when attention naturally dips
- Deep Work Block 2 at 2 PM after a midday recovery period

**2. Build in renewal:**
- Physical: Morning exercise, midday walk
- Emotional: Gratitude journal, social lunch, daily wins reflection
- Mental: Scheduled breaks, no screens after 9 PM
- Spiritual: Quiet reflection at 1 PM, evening hobby time

**3. Habit stacks integrated:**
- "After I wake up, I will exercise immediately" (stacking on wake time)
- "After breakfast, I will write three gratitudes" (stacking on meal)
- "After finishing work at 9 PM, I will plan tomorrow" (stacking on work end)

Important caveats:
- This is a SAMPLE—not a prescription. Each person's energy rhythms differ.
- University schedules vary; adapt the template to your commitments.
- Weekend systems differ from weekday systems.

Emphasize customization: "Your task isn't to copy this system—it's to design YOUR system using these principles. When is YOUR mental energy highest? When do YOU need renewal most? Build around your natural rhythms."

Connect to PDP: "Section 5 requires a detailed weekly schedule. Use this as a template, then customize based on your energy audit, class schedule, and goals."
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="24" title="Building Your First Habit Stack">

## Design Your First Habit Stack

**Step 1:** Identify a rock-solid existing habit (anchor)
- Examples: Morning coffee, brushing teeth, arriving home, finishing dinner

**Step 2:** Choose ONE new habit to stack (start small!)
- Examples: 10-min reading, 5-min journaling, 2-min stretching, reviewing flashcards

**Step 3:** Write your implementation intention
- "After [ANCHOR HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT] at [LOCATION]."

**Step 4:** Apply the Four Laws
- **Obvious:** Prepare materials the night before
- **Attractive:** Pair with something enjoyable
- **Easy:** Make it ridiculously small at first
- **Satisfying:** Track your streak visually

**Your Turn (2 minutes):** Design one habit stack right now. Write it down.

<speaker-notes>
This is a hands-on application moment. Give students actual time to design their first habit stack using the formulas learned today.

Facilitation:
1. Have students write down 3 existing rock-solid habits (things they do daily without thinking).
2. Choose ONE new habit they want to build (emphasize: start with just one).
3. Write the habit stack formula: "After [EXISTING], I will [NEW] at [LOCATION]."
4. Apply the Four Laws as a checklist to strengthen the stack.

Walk around (if possible) or ask volunteers to share their habit stacks. Common examples:
- "After I pour my morning coffee, I will review 10 vocabulary flashcards at my kitchen table."
- "After I finish dinner, I will write three things I learned today in my journal at my desk."
- "After I brush my teeth at night, I will do 10 push-ups in my bedroom."

Key coaching:
- **Too ambitious:** "After I wake up, I will run 5 km" → Reduce to "After I wake up, I will put on running shoes and walk outside for 2 minutes." (Make it easy!)
- **Unstable anchor:** "After I exercise, I will..." → Exercise isn't reliable yet. Choose a more stable anchor.
- **Too vague:** "After breakfast, I will study" → Specify: "After breakfast, I will study Finance formulas for 20 minutes at my desk."

Connect to PDP: "This is practice for Section 5, where you'll design 3-5 habit stacks aligned with your goals. Start with this one stack this week. Track it for 7 days. Note what works and what needs adjustment. Then you'll refine it in your PDP."

Vietnamese context: Vietnamese students are excellent at planning but often struggle with implementation. Habit stacks bridge that gap by making behavior automatic rather than willpower-dependent.

<slide number="25" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

1. **Energy is renewable; time is not** → Manage your energy across four dimensions, not just your schedule

2. **Protect Quadrant 2 time** → Use Eisenhower Matrix to identify important work; time-block it before urgency consumes your week

3. **Deep work is a skill** → Start with 1-2 hours daily; build rhythmic schedule; eliminate distractions ruthlessly

4. **Habits form through cue-routine-reward loops** → Use Four Laws and habit stacking to automate behaviors; expect 66 days median formation time

5. **Systems beat goals** → Design integrated productivity system combining energy management, prioritization, deep work, and habit formation

<speaker-notes>
Five key takeaways summarizing today's content:

1. The paradigm shift from time to energy—Schwartz's four dimensions provide a sustainable approach.

2. Prioritization—live in Quadrant 2 (important but not urgent), not constant urgency of Q1.

3. Deep work—focused attention determines output quality; build capacity gradually starting with 1-2 hours.

4. Habits—Clear's Four Laws and Lally's research show how to make behaviors automatic over 66+ days.

5. Systems thinking—these frameworks integrate into a comprehensive productivity system.

These aren't separate tools—they work together. Energy management provides capacity. Prioritization focuses that capacity. Deep work maximizes output during focused time. Habits automate the system so it sustains without willpower.

Tutorial applies all five to your personal context. You'll leave with actionable plans for your PDP.

## Tutorial: Design Your Productivity System

**Activities:**

1. **Energy Audit** - Assess current state across four dimensions; identify drains and design renewal rituals

2. **Time-Blocking Exercise** - Create next week's schedule protecting Quadrant 2 deep work time

3. **Habit Stacking Plan** - Design 2-3 habit stacks using implementation intentions formula

4. **Deep Work Capacity Assessment** - Estimate current deep work hours; set capacity-building goal

**All outputs feed directly into your Personal Development Plan Section 5.**

<speaker-notes>
Tutorial has four applied exercises that directly build your PDP content:

1. **Energy audit** using Schwartz's template—you'll rate yourself across four dimensions and design specific renewal rituals. This becomes the foundation of your energy management strategy.

2. **Time-blocking** next week's schedule with protected deep work blocks. Practice the rhythmic philosophy Newport recommends. You'll identify your peak energy hours and block them for Q2 priorities.

3. **Habit stacking**—design 2-3 habit stacks for behaviors you want to automate, applying all Four Laws to strengthen each stack.

4. **Deep work capacity assessment**—honestly estimate your current capacity for deep work (many students overestimate). Create a 12-week building plan to expand that capacity sustainably.

All four outputs become draft content for your PDP Section 5. Bring your laptop, calendar, and list of goals from previous weeks. Be ready to do real implementation work, not just discussion.
