# 66 Days

**average time to form a new habit — not 21**

*(Lally et al. 2010, n=96)*

**Range: 18-254 days depending on habit complexity**

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- Pause for impact. "How many of you have heard it takes 21 days to form a habit?" (expect hands)
- "That's a myth. The actual research shows something very different—and much more encouraging."

**Key Points:**
- The 21-day myth comes from a misinterpretation of 1960s plastic surgery research (Dr. Maxwell Maltz)
- Actual scientific study: Phillippa Lally at University College London tracked 96 people forming real habits
- Finding: Habits take 18-254 days, median 66 days—there's huge individual variation
- More encouraging truth: Missing ONE day doesn't restart the clock—habit formation follows a curve, not a countdown

**Why This Matters:**
- Week 8 is about building systems, not quick fixes
- You're designing habits for your Personal Development Plan that will compound over years
- Understanding the real timeline prevents discouragement ("I tried for 3 weeks and it didn't stick!")

**Example:**
- Simple habit (drinking water after breakfast): ~20 days to automaticity
- Complex habit (50 daily sit-ups): ~84 days to automaticity
- Your academic/career habits likely fall in the 60-90 day range

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why is knowing the real timeline helpful rather than discouraging?"
- Desired answer: Sets realistic expectations, shows missing one day is okay, focuses on consistency over perfection

**Transition:**
- "Today we're going to learn the science of how to build habits that actually stick—and pair them with time and energy management strategies that make sustainable high performance possible..."

# Time, Energy & Habit Management
## Building Sustainable High Performance

**Week 8 Focus Areas:**
- Paradigm shift: managing energy, not just time
- Prioritization frameworks for decision-making
- Deep work and time-blocking for focused productivity
- Habit formation science and implementation strategies
- Sustainable performance through energy renewal

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "This week tackles one of students' biggest struggles: 'I don't have enough time'"
- "The research suggests a different problem: You're managing the wrong resource"

**Key Points:**
- Time is finite—you have exactly 168 hours per week, period
- Energy is renewable—you can expand your capacity through strategic recovery
- Habits are leverage—good systems reduce decision fatigue and protect willpower
- Deep work is the skill—ability to focus intensely is increasingly rare and valuable

**Connection to Previous Weeks:**
- Week 4 (Self-Managed Learning): Metacognition about how you learn
- Week 8: Systems that enable effective learning and sustainable performance
- These aren't separate—self-awareness + good systems = exceptional results

**Connection to Assessments:**
- Personal Development Plan requires implementation strategies for your goals
- This week provides frameworks: time-blocking for studying, habit stacks for skill development, energy management for avoiding burnout
- Mentorship Program: Ask your mentor how they manage time/energy in demanding careers

**Cultural Context:**
- Vietnamese students often face intense academic pressure + family expectations + career preparation
- This creates chronic stress and burnout risk
- Western productivity advice (e.g., "just say no") doesn't account for collectivist obligations
- We'll adapt frameworks for your context

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with the paradigm shift that changes everything..."

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Contrast** time vs. energy management paradigms
2. **Apply** Eisenhower Matrix for prioritization
3. **Explain** deep work concept and design time-blocking schedules
4. **Describe** habit formation science and create habit stacks
5. **Evaluate** personal energy patterns across four dimensions

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- These objectives build on each other—each framework connects to the next

**How They Connect:**
1. Energy management (Objective 1) explains WHY time management alone fails
2. Eisenhower Matrix (Objective 2) helps you prioritize what deserves your energy
3. Deep work + time-blocking (Objective 3) protects your highest-quality energy for most important work
4. Habit formation (Objective 4) automates behaviors so they don't drain willpower
5. Energy evaluation (Objective 5) creates self-awareness for sustainable systems

**Assessment Relevance:**
- PDP Component: Implementation strategies for goals
  - Objective 1-2: Determines how you allocate time to goals
  - Objective 3: Ensures deep work on high-impact activities (not just busy work)
  - Objective 4: Creates automatic progress through habit systems
  - Objective 5: Prevents burnout as you pursue ambitious goals

**Tutorial Preview:**
- You'll practice every framework today
- You'll create actual schedules, habit stacks, and energy management plans
- Everything you build in tutorial can be implemented THIS week

**Transition:**
- "Let's begin with a question: What's more scarce—your time or your energy?"

# Part 1: Energy Management
## The Paradigm Shift

<speaker-notes>
**Setup:**
- "Traditional time management assumes the problem is time allocation"
- "Energy management research suggests time is the wrong metric"
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="5" layout="content" title="The Time Management Trap">
## Why Traditional Time Management Fails

**The Traditional Approach:**
- Schedule every hour efficiently
- Maximize productivity during available time
- "Work smarter, not harder"
- Focus: Getting more done in less time

**The Problem:**
- Treats energy as constant throughout the day
- Ignores that you have different capacities at different times
- Results in burnout from unsustainable pace
- Focus on quantity over quality of work

**The Reality:**
> "The number of hours in a day is fixed, but the quantity and quality of energy available to us is not."
> — **Tony Schwartz & Catherine McCarthy** (HBR, 2007)

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Who here uses a daily planner or calendar app?" (expect many hands)
- "Who here has perfectly planned days that still feel exhausting and unproductive?" (expect same hands)
- "That gap reveals the flaw in time management alone"

**The Limitation:**
- Example schedule: 8am class, 10am study session, 2pm group meeting, 5pm club activity, 7pm homework
- Looks productive—every hour accounted for
- Reality: By 2pm you're mentally drained from morning; by 7pm you're staring at textbook unable to focus
- Time was "managed" but energy wasn't—result is ineffective effort

**Real Student Experience:**
- Student: "I studied 6 hours today but retained nothing"
- Time management view: You allocated time—success!
- Energy management view: You studied with depleted mental energy—ineffective use of time

**The Shift:**
- Stop asking: "How can I fit more into my schedule?"
- Start asking: "When am I at my highest energy for this type of work?"

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Long class days (8am-5pm) deplete energy
- Evening is often lowest-energy time, yet that's when students try to study hardest
- Cultural expectation of long study hours ≠ effective learning
- We need smarter approach

**Transition:**
- "So if time management isn't enough, what's the alternative?"

<slide number="6" layout="framework" title="The Four Energy Dimensions">
## Schwartz's Energy Management Model

**Energy operates across four dimensions:**

| Dimension | Focus | Depletion Signs | Renewal Strategies |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Physical** | Body | Fatigue, low stamina | Sleep, nutrition, movement, breaks |
| **Emotional** | Feelings | Irritability, anxiety | Positive emotions, appreciation, connection |
| **Mental** | Focus | Scattered attention, mental fog | Concentration practices, reducing interruptions |
| **Spiritual** | Purpose | Cynicism, disconnection | Meaning, values alignment, purpose-driven work |

**Key Insight:** All four dimensions must be managed—neglecting one undermines the others

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Schwartz identifies four types of energy—think of them as four fuel tanks"
- "If ANY tank is empty, your overall performance suffers"

**Physical Energy:**
- Most obvious form—you literally feel it in your body
- Depletion: Tiredness, difficulty concentrating, physical discomfort
- Renewal: The basics work—sleep, food, exercise, breaks
- Student mistake: Pulling all-nighters depletes physical energy for days

**Emotional Energy:**
- Quality of your emotional state affects performance
- Depletion: When you're anxious about grades, irritated with groupmates, stressed about family expectations
- Renewal: Positive experiences, gratitude practices, supportive relationships
- Vietnamese context: Emotional energy often depleted by fear of disappointing family—needs active management

**Mental Energy:**
- Your capacity for focus and complex thinking
- Depletion: After 3 hours of classes, mental energy is low even if you're not physically tired
- Renewal: Breaks from cognitively demanding work, varied activities, strategic rest
- Most relevant for students—this is what determines learning effectiveness

**Spiritual Energy:**
- Connection to purpose and meaning
- Depletion: When you feel like "What's the point? Why does this matter?"
- Renewal: Reconnecting with goals, remembering why you chose business school, values-aligned activities
- Often neglected but crucial—purpose provides intrinsic motivation when extrinsic pressure fades

**The Interaction:**
- Example: You're physically rested (good sleep) but emotionally drained (fought with family)
  - Result: Can't focus on studying even though physically capable
- All four must be managed together

**Self-Assessment:**
- "Think about right now, this moment—which of your four energy dimensions is lowest?"
- "That's your bottleneck for performance this week"

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at specific strategies for managing energy across these dimensions..."

<slide number="7" layout="content" title="Energy Renewal Rituals">
## Practical Energy Management Strategies

**Physical Energy:**
- **90-120 minute work cycles:** Natural ultradian rhythm—work in focused bursts, then break
- **Movement breaks:** 5-10 minutes every hour (walk, stretch, physical activity)
- **Strategic nutrition:** Avoid blood sugar crashes (protein + complex carbs, not just coffee/sugar)
- **Non-negotiable sleep:** 7-9 hours for memory consolidation and cognitive recovery

**Emotional Energy:**
- **Gratitude practice:** 3 things you're grateful for daily (research shows mood improvement)
- **Social connection:** Brief positive interactions throughout day
- **Celebration of wins:** Acknowledge progress, don't only focus on what's undone

**Mental Energy:**
- **Single-tasking:** No multitasking during focused work (attention residue is real)
- **Digital boundaries:** Phone off or out of sight during deep work
- **Variety:** Alternate mentally demanding and less demanding tasks

**Spiritual Energy:**
- **Values check:** Weekly reflection on whether activities align with purpose
- **Meaningful work first:** Schedule most purposeful tasks when energy is highest

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "These aren't tips—these are evidence-based strategies from performance research"
- "You don't need to do all of them. Pick 2-3 that address YOUR energy bottlenecks"

**Physical Energy Strategies:**

**90-120 minute cycles:**
- Research: Ultradian Basic Rest-Activity Cycle (Kleitman, 1969)
- Your brain naturally oscillates between high and low alertness every ~90 minutes
- Fighting this rhythm = depleting energy faster
- Strategy: Pomodoro Technique uses 25-min cycles; for deep work, extend to 50-90 min with substantial breaks

**Movement breaks:**
- Even 5 minutes of walking increases blood flow to brain
- Reduces physical discomfort from sitting
- Neurologically refreshes attention

**Sleep is non-negotiable:**
- Students often sacrifice sleep for study time—this is counterproductive
- Sleep deprivation impairs learning more than lost study time helps
- One all-nighter = 2-3 days of impaired cognitive function

**Emotional Energy Strategies:**

**Gratitude practice:**
- Meta-analysis: Gratitude interventions increase well-being and reduce depression
- Mechanism: Shifts attention from what's wrong to what's working
- Takes 2 minutes, high ROI

**Celebration:**
- Students focus on what's undone (next exam, unfinished assignment)
- Chronic deficit mindset depletes emotional energy
- Actively noting progress restores energy

**Mental Energy Strategies:**

**Single-tasking:**
- Multitasking is a myth—brain switches rapidly between tasks
- Each switch incurs "attention residue" (Sophie Leroy research)
- When you shift from studying to checking phone to studying, residual attention stays on phone
- Result: Diminished focus, slower work, more errors

**Digital boundaries:**
- Smartphone presence reduces cognitive capacity even when off (Ward et al., 2017)
- Recommendation: Different room during deep work

**Spiritual Energy Strategies:**

**Values alignment:**
- When work feels meaningless, energy depletes faster
- Reconnecting to "why"—why business school, why this career path—restores energy
- For students: Remember long-term goals when short-term tasks feel tedious

**Application:**
- "In tutorial, you'll audit your energy across all four dimensions"
- "You'll identify which strategies address YOUR specific energy drains"

**Transition:**
- "Energy management tells you WHEN to work. But you still need to decide WHAT to work on. That's where prioritization frameworks come in..."

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="The Eisenhower Matrix">
## Prioritizing by Urgency vs. Importance

**The Framework:**

|  | **URGENT** | **NOT URGENT** |
|---|---|---|
| **IMPORTANT** | **Quadrant 1: DO FIRST**<br>Crises, deadlines, pressing problems<br>*Example: Exam tomorrow, group presentation today* | **Quadrant 2: SCHEDULE**<br>Planning, development, prevention<br>*Example: Start major assignment early, skill-building, relationship-building* |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | **Quadrant 3: DELEGATE/MINIMIZE**<br>Interruptions, some emails, others' priorities<br>*Example: Unimportant meeting, low-value busy work* | **Quadrant 4: ELIMINATE**<br>Time wasters, escape activities<br>*Example: Mindless social media, excessive TV* |

**Key Insight:** Most people live in Quadrant 1 + 3 (urgent). High performers live in Quadrant 2 (important but not yet urgent).

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Eisenhower was US President who famously said: 'What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important'"
- "This matrix helps you distinguish between the two"

**The Four Quadrants:**

**Quadrant 1: Urgent + Important (DO FIRST)**
- Legitimate crises and deadlines
- Examples for students:
  - Exam is tomorrow
  - Group presentation is today and you're unprepared
  - Sick family member needs help
- Problem: If you LIVE in Q1, you're always in crisis mode—exhausting and unsustainable
- Goal: Minimize time in Q1 by working in Q2

**Quadrant 2: Not Urgent + Important (SCHEDULE—This is the key)**
- Activities that prevent Q1 crises
- Examples for students:
  - Starting major assignment when assigned (not 2 days before due)
  - Building relationships with professors and mentors
  - Developing skills for future career
  - Exercise and health maintenance
  - Planning your week strategically
- This quadrant is where high performance lives
- Problem: Q2 never FEELS urgent, so students neglect it until it becomes Q1
- Solution: SCHEDULE Q2 time like appointments—protect it

**Quadrant 3: Urgent + Not Important (MINIMIZE)**
- Feels urgent but doesn't actually advance your goals
- Examples for students:
  - Friend's drama that pulls you into long conversation
  - Low-stakes club meeting that could be an email
  - Responding immediately to every group chat message
- Trap: Urgency creates illusion of importance
- Strategy: Batch these tasks, do quickly, or politely decline

**Quadrant 4: Not Urgent + Not Important (ELIMINATE)**
- Pure time wasters
- Examples:
  - Scrolling social media mindlessly
  - Binge-watching shows you don't even enjoy
  - Excessive gaming
- Trap: These are escape activities when Q1 stress is high
- Strategy: Replace with Q2 activities that actually restore energy (exercise, socializing, hobbies you value)

**The Student Trap:**
- Most students: 50% Q1 (cramming, crisis), 30% Q4 (escape/procrastination), 15% Q3 (others' priorities), 5% Q2
- High performers: 25% Q1 (some deadlines unavoidable), 65% Q2 (strategic planning), 5% Q3, 5% Q4
- The shift: Invest in Q2 to reduce Q1 crises

**Application:**
- "In tutorial, you'll categorize your actual activities from last week"
- "You'll likely discover you're spending almost no time in Q2—the most important quadrant"

**Vietnamese Context:**
- Collectivist culture means many Q3 activities feel mandatory (family/social obligations)
- Can't always "just say no" without social consequences
- Strategy: Minimize where possible, but recognize some Q3 is cultural reality
- Even more important to protect Q2 time

**Transition:**
- "The Eisenhower Matrix helps you decide WHAT to prioritize. But you still need a system for protecting focused time. That's where time-blocking comes in..."

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="Time-Blocking Methodology">
## Protecting Your Most Valuable Resource: Attention

**The Concept:**
Schedule specific blocks of time for specific types of work (rather than working from to-do lists)

**Newport's Time-Blocking Principles:**
1. **Block every hour** of your workday the night before
2. **Protect deep work blocks** like doctor appointments—non-negotiable
3. **Batch similar tasks** (emails, errands, admin) into dedicated blocks
4. **Build in buffer** for unexpected tasks
5. **Revise as needed** but don't abandon structure

**Example Student Schedule:**

| Time | Block | Energy Level | Task Type |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 8:00-10:00 | Deep Work | Peak mental energy | Complex studying (accounting, analytics) |
| 10:00-10:30 | Break | - | Walk, snack, refresh |
| 10:30-12:00 | Moderate Work | Good mental energy | Attend class / group work |
| 12:00-1:00 | Lunch + Social | Low mental energy | Eat, socialize, recharge emotionally |
| 1:00-3:00 | Shallow Work | Moderate energy | Administrative tasks, emails, organization |
| 3:00-5:00 | Deep Work | Second peak | Creative work (presentations, writing) |

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Show of hands: How many use to-do lists?" (expect many)
- "How many feel your to-do list is never done and keeps growing?" (expect same hands)
- "That's because to-do lists don't account for TIME—time-blocking does"

**Why Time-Blocking Works:**
- To-do lists are unbounded—you can always add more tasks
- Time is bounded—you have exactly 24 hours, period
- Time-blocking forces realistic assessment: "Can I actually do this today?"
- Creates commitment: "I will work on X from 2-4pm" is stronger than "I should work on X sometime"

**The Process:**

**1. Block every hour the night before:**
- Doesn't mean every hour is work—includes breaks, meals, sleep
- Forces you to be intentional, not reactive
- Reveals time scarcity: "I thought I could do 8 things today, but blocking shows I only have time for 3"

**2. Protect deep work blocks:**
- Treat like appointments with your mentor—you wouldn't skip those
- Phone off, email closed, door shut (if possible)
- These blocks are your highest-value work time

**3. Batch similar tasks:**
- Context-switching depletes energy (attention residue)
- Batching emails into 30-min block twice daily is more efficient than checking every 10 minutes
- Same for errands, administrative tasks, etc.

**4. Buffer time:**
- Plan for only 4-5 hours of deep work daily (NOT 8-10)
- Rest is meetings, admin, breaks, unexpected tasks
- Overscheduling guarantees failure and discouragement

**5. Revise as needed:**
- Plans fail—that's okay
- When unexpected task arises, don't abandon structure
- Quickly revise: "This new task takes 1 hour; what block do I move or shorten?"

**Example Schedule Explanation:**

**8:00-10:00 Deep Work:**
- For most people, morning is peak mental energy
- Allocate to hardest cognitive tasks
- For students: Quantitative subjects (math, accounting, analytics), complex readings

**10:30-12:00 Class/Group Work:**
- Moderate energy tasks
- If morning class, shift deep work to afternoon

**12:00-1:00 Lunch:**
- Low mental energy time (post-lunch dip is real)
- Don't fight biology—use for rest and social connection
- Emotional energy renewal

**1:00-3:00 Shallow Work:**
- Admin tasks: organizing notes, planning, emails, light readings
- Still productive but not cognitively demanding

**3:00-5:00 Second Deep Work:**
- Many people have second peak mid-afternoon
- Creative work often better here than morning (brainstorming, writing, presentations)

**Customization:**
- "This is sample—you'll discover your own energy rhythms"
- "In tutorial, you'll map YOUR energy patterns across a day"
- "Then design time blocks that match your natural rhythms"

**Common Student Mistakes:**
- Mistake 1: Scheduling 8 hours of deep work—impossible, leads to discouragement
- Mistake 2: Not actually blocking time—just making to-do list with times (no commitment)
- Mistake 3: Abandoning structure when one thing goes wrong instead of revising

**Transition:**
- "Time-blocking protects attention for important work. But even with great schedules, distractions still tempt us. That's where Cal Newport's deep work concept becomes essential..."

# Part 3: Deep Work
## The Premium Skill of the Knowledge Economy

<slide number="12" layout="quote" title="What Is Deep Work?">
## Newport's Definition and Formula

**Deep Work:**
> "Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate."
> — **Cal Newport** (2016)

**The Formula:**
**High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent × Intensity of Focus**

**Opposite: Shallow Work**
- Logistical, low-value tasks performed while distracted
- Easy to replicate, doesn't create much value
- Examples: Organizing files, responding to routine emails, attending low-stakes meetings

**Why Deep Work Matters:**
1. Increasingly rare in distraction-saturated world
2. Increasingly valuable (AI can do shallow work; deep work requires human insight)
3. Personally fulfilling (flow states, mastery, meaningful progress)

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Think about the last time you were completely absorbed in work—hours passed without noticing"
- "That state is deep work, and it's becoming rare"

**Breaking Down the Definition:**

**"Distraction-free concentration":**
- Not just "trying hard while phone is nearby"
- Literally zero interruptions—phone off, notifications silenced, door closed
- Brain needs 15-20 minutes to reach deep focus; one notification resets the clock

**"Push cognitive capabilities to their limit":**
- This is effortful, even uncomfortable
- You're working at edge of current ability
- Examples for students: Mastering difficult concepts, analyzing complex cases, synthesizing research

**"Create new value":**
- Learning a skill that makes you more capable
- Producing work others can't easily replicate
- Deep work on assignments produces A-level work; shallow work produces C-level

**"Hard to replicate":**
- If anyone could do it while multitasking, it's not deep work
- Deep work requires focused intelligence—this is what employers pay premium for

**The Formula Explained:**

**Time Spent × Intensity of Focus:**
- Most students optimize for time: "I studied 6 hours!"
- Newport says intensity matters more: 2 hours of deep focus > 6 hours of distracted studying
- Example:
  - Shallow: 4 hours studying while checking phone, chatting with roommate, music with lyrics = ~1 hour of actual cognitive work
  - Deep: 2 hours completely focused, phone in other room = 2+ hours of cognitive work (higher intensity multiplier)
- Quality compounds: Deep work builds skills faster, creating upward spiral

**Shallow Work:**
- Not bad or useless—often necessary
- Examples: Responding to emails, organizing notes, scheduling meetings, routine homework
- Problem: Most people spend 80% of time on shallow work, 20% on deep
- High performers: 50% deep, 50% shallow (by minimizing and batching shallow)

**Why Deep Work Is Rare:**
- Open office environments encourage constant interruption
- Digital tools (email, messaging) create expectation of immediate response
- Social media trains brains for constant distraction
- Students: Dorm life, group chats, social obligations all interrupt focus

**Why Deep Work Is Valuable:**
- AI can handle shallow work (data entry, routine analysis, scheduling)
- Deep work—creative problem-solving, complex learning, insight generation—remains human domain
- As shallow work is automated, deep work commands higher premium

**Why Deep Work Is Fulfilling:**
- Csikszentmihalyi's "flow state" research: Deep focus is intrinsically rewarding
- Shallow work feels busy but unsatisfying (email all day, what did you accomplish?)
- Deep work creates sense of progress and mastery

**For Students:**
- Deep work is how you actually LEARN, not just complete assignments
- Surface-level studying (re-reading notes while distracted) creates illusion of learning
- Deep work (active recall, practice problems, synthesis) creates actual learning

**Transition:**
- "So how do you actually practice deep work in a world designed for distraction?"

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="Deep Work Strategies">
## Building Your Deep Work Capacity

**Newport's Four Strategies:**

**1. Rhythmic Philosophy (Best for Students)**
- Schedule deep work same time every day
- Builds habit, reduces decision fatigue
- Example: 8-10am daily deep work block, non-negotiable

**2. Journalistic Philosophy**
- Fit deep work whenever you have free time
- Requires experience to "turn on" focus quickly
- Example: Professional writers who write during any available 60-90 min gap

**3. Bimodal Philosophy**
- Alternate between deep work periods (days/weeks) and shallow work periods
- Example: Writer who retreats to cabin for 2 weeks of writing, then 2 weeks of editing/admin

**4. Monastic Philosophy**
- Eliminate shallow work entirely
- Example: Academic researcher with no email, no phone, only research
- Unrealistic for students (you have required classes, group projects, etc.)

**For Most Students: Rhythmic Philosophy**
- Daily deep work ritual at same time
- Paired with time-blocking
- Most sustainable approach

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Newport identifies four philosophies—ways to structure deep work into your life"
- "For students, one clearly works best, but it's useful to know all four"

**Rhythmic Philosophy (Recommend This):**
- Schedule deep work as daily habit, same time
- Advantages:
  - No decision fatigue ("Should I do deep work now?")
  - Habit formation: After 2-3 weeks, brain expects deep work at this time
  - Sustainable long-term
- Example student schedule:
  - 8-10am every weekday: Deep work on hardest subject
  - After 3 weeks, brain automatically shifts to focus mode at 8am
- Pairs perfectly with time-blocking

**Journalistic Philosophy:**
- Opportunistic: Use any free hour for deep work
- Advantages:
  - Flexible, maximizes available time
- Disadvantages:
  - Requires ability to shift into deep work quickly (takes practice)
  - Beginners struggle: "I have 2 free hours suddenly, but can't focus"
- For students: Usually doesn't work until you've practiced rhythmic for months
- Can supplement rhythmic: "My daily block is 8-10am, but if I get free afternoon, I'll add bonus deep work"

**Bimodal Philosophy:**
- Extreme batching: Days/weeks of only deep work, then days/weeks of only shallow
- Advantages:
  - Allows extended immersion in complex projects
- Disadvantages:
  - Requires control over schedule students rarely have
  - Shallow work piles up during deep periods
- For students: Maybe during semester break for major project
- Example: Week before exams, minimize shallow work, batch deep study sessions

**Monastic Philosophy:**
- Eliminate all shallow work and distractions
- Advantages:
  - Maximum deep work capacity
- Disadvantages:
  - Impossible for students (required classes, group work, social obligations)
  - Isolating
- For students: Not realistic, but illustrates the ideal
- Takeaway: Even if you can't be monastic, you can create "monastic moments"—2 hours where you act as if only deep work exists

**Choosing Your Philosophy:**
- Start with Rhythmic: 1-2 hours daily at consistent time
- Supplement with Journalistic: Opportunistic deep work when schedule allows
- Experiment with Bimodal: During breaks or before major deadlines
- Forget Monastic: Not viable for students

**Application:**
- "In tutorial, you'll design your rhythmic deep work schedule"
- "You'll identify: When is your peak mental energy? What time can you protect daily?"

**Transition:**
- "Deep work is the 'what' of high performance. But to sustain it, you need automatic behaviors that support it. That's where habit science comes in..."

|-------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Cue** | Trigger that initiates behavior | See gym bag by door | See phone notification |
| **Craving** | Desire for change the habit provides | Want to feel energized | Want to know what notification says |
| **Response** | Actual habit you perform | Go to gym | Check phone |
| **Reward** | Benefit that satisfies craving | Endorphins, sense of accomplishment | Dopamine hit, curiosity satisfied |

**Key Insight:** You're not craving the behavior (gym, phone)—you're craving the reward (energy, information). Understanding this unlocks habit design.

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "James Clear synthesizes decades of habit research into this four-stage model"
- "Understanding each stage gives you leverage to build good habits and break bad ones"

**The Four Stages Explained:**

**Cue (Trigger):**
- External or internal signal that starts the habit loop
- External cues: Time (8am), location (kitchen), preceding event (finish class)
- Internal cues: Emotion (bored), physical state (hungry)
- Cues are unconscious—you don't "decide" to notice them
- Examples for students:
  - Good: Textbook on desk (cue to study)
  - Bad: Phone on bed (cue to scroll before sleep)

**Craving (Motivation):**
- The desire for the change the habit delivers
- Not desire for habit itself, but for the STATE the habit creates
- Examples:
  - You don't crave running; you crave feeling fit
  - You don't crave scrolling Instagram; you crave feeling connected/entertained
- Cravings are what make habits motivating (or addictive)
- Key: You can engineer cravings for good habits

**Response (Behavior):**
- The actual habit—the action you perform
- Can be thought or action
- Must be POSSIBLE given current ability and motivation
  - If habit is too hard, you won't do it (even if craving is strong)
- Examples:
  - Good: 10 push-ups after waking
  - Bad: 2-hour gym session (too hard to sustain as daily habit)

**Reward (Outcome):**
- The benefit from performing habit
- Satisfies the craving
- Teaches brain: "This behavior is worth repeating"
- Two types:
  - Intrinsic: Direct benefit (exercise → feel good)
  - Extrinsic: Added incentive (track workout streak → feel accomplished)
- Rewards must be immediate (delayed rewards don't reinforce habit)

**The Loop:**
- Cue triggers craving
- Craving motivates response
- Response delivers reward
- Reward satisfies craving AND reinforces cue-response connection
- After repetitions, loop becomes automatic

**Example Walkthrough (Good Habit):**
- Cue: Finish breakfast
- Craving: Want to feel prepared for day
- Response: Review daily time-block schedule for 5 minutes
- Reward: Clarity about day, reduced anxiety, sense of control
- After 3-4 weeks: Finishing breakfast automatically triggers schedule review (no willpower needed)

**Example Walkthrough (Bad Habit):**
- Cue: Feel bored during studying
- Craving: Want stimulation/entertainment
- Response: Check social media
- Reward: Dopamine from new content, temporary relief from boredom
- Loop reinforces: Boredom → phone (automatic)

**Why This Matters:**
- Most habits are unconscious—you're not "choosing" to check phone 100x/day
- Habit loop explains why willpower fails: You're fighting automatic neurological pattern
- Solution: Don't fight the loop, REDESIGN it

**Transition:**
- "Understanding the loop is step one. Now let's look at how to actually build good habits and break bad ones..."

## Building Good Habits, Breaking Bad Ones

**The Four Laws for Building Good Habits:**

| Law | Habit Stage | Strategy | Example |
|-----|-------------|----------|---------|
| **1st Law: Make It Obvious** | Cue | Design environment to trigger desired behavior | Put running shoes by bed to trigger morning run |
| **2nd Law: Make It Attractive** | Craving | Pair habit with something you enjoy | Listen to favorite podcast only while exercising |
| **3rd Law: Make It Easy** | Response | Reduce friction, start small | "Just 10 minutes" of studying (lower barrier) |
| **4th Law: Make It Satisfying** | Reward | Immediate gratification for habit completion | Track habit streak, visual progress |

**Inversion: Breaking Bad Habits**

| Inversion | Strategy | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Make It Invisible** | Remove cue | Delete social media apps from phone |
| **Make It Unattractive** | Reframe cost | Remind yourself: "Every scroll = 2 min of studying lost" |
| **Make It Difficult** | Increase friction | Log out of accounts, move phone to other room |
| **Make It Unsatisfying** | Add immediate cost | Accountability partner gets notified when you fail |

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "These Four Laws are your practical toolkit for habit design"
- "Each law targets one stage of the habit loop"

**1st Law: Make It Obvious (Cue Design)**

**For Building Good Habits:**
- Principle: You can't do a habit you don't remember to do
- Strategies:
  - Implementation intentions: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
    - Example: "I will review flashcards at 8pm in library"
    - Research shows this increases follow-through by 2-3x
  - Habit stacking (covered next slide): Attach new habit to existing one
  - Environment design: Make cues visible
    - Put water bottle on desk → drink more water
    - Put textbook on pillow → study before bed
- For students:
  - Want to exercise? Put gym clothes out the night before
  - Want to review notes daily? Schedule recurring calendar alert

**Inversion (Breaking Bad Habits): Make It Invisible**
- Remove cues for bad habits
- Examples:
  - Too much phone use? Delete social media apps (can still use on computer, but not in pocket)
  - Eating junk food? Don't keep it in dorm room
  - Procrastinating on YouTube? Block sites during study hours (browser extensions)

**2nd Law: Make It Attractive (Craving Design)**

**For Building Good Habits:**
- Principle: You need to WANT to do the habit
- Strategies:
  - Temptation bundling: Pair habit you need with habit you want
    - Example: "I only watch Netflix while on exercise bike"
    - The Netflix (attractive) becomes reward for exercise (needed)
  - Join culture where desired behavior is normal
    - Study groups normalize studying
    - Athletic clubs normalize exercise
- For students:
  - Make studying attractive: Study at cafe you love, with coffee you enjoy
  - Group study sessions make academic work social (more attractive)

**Inversion: Make It Unattractive**
- Highlight costs of bad habit
- Examples:
  - Social media: Calculate time wasted per week (28 hours/week = part-time job)
  - Procrastination: Imagine stress of last-minute cramming

**3rd Law: Make It Easy (Response Design)**

**For Building Good Habits:**
- Principle: Lower the barrier to action
- Strategies:
  - Two-Minute Rule: New habits should take <2 minutes
    - Not "Study for 2 hours" → "Open textbook and read one page"
    - Not "Exercise 30 minutes" → "Do 1 push-up"
    - Gateway: Starting is hardest part; once started, often continue
  - Reduce friction:
    - Want to study in library? Pack bag night before so it's grab-and-go
    - Want to eat healthy? Meal prep on Sunday so healthy food is easiest option
- For students:
  - Make starting homework easy: "Just write title and thesis statement" (2 min)
  - Often this leads to continuing for 30+ minutes

**Inversion: Make It Difficult**
- Increase friction for bad habits
- Examples:
  - Phone distraction: Phone in different room (requires getting up)
  - Late-night snacking: Don't keep snacks in room (requires trip to store)
- Even small friction reduces frequency

**4th Law: Make It Satisfying (Reward Design)**

**For Building Good Habits:**
- Principle: We repeat behaviors that feel good
- Problem: Many good habits have delayed rewards
  - Exercise: Benefits months away
  - Studying: Grades come later
  - Saving money: Payoff is future
- Solution: Add immediate reward
- Strategies:
  - Habit tracking: Visual progress (check box, streak counter)
    - Provides immediate satisfaction of "completed"
  - Small rewards: After workout, smoothie you love; after study session, 10 min of enjoyable activity
- For students:
  - Track study hours on calendar (visual satisfaction)
  - After completing assignment, reward yourself (guilt-free leisure time)

**Inversion: Make It Unsatisfying**
- Add immediate cost to bad habits
- Examples:
  - Accountability partner: If you skip gym, must donate $10 to charity
  - Habit contract: Public commitment with consequences
- Social cost is powerful: No one wants to report failure to accountability partner

**Applying All Four Laws:**
- Best results: Apply multiple laws together
- Example (building exercise habit):
  - Make obvious: Gym clothes by bed, calendar alert
  - Make attractive: Pair with podcast, join fitness class with friends
  - Make easy: Start with just 10 minutes, gym on way home from class
  - Make satisfying: Track workouts, celebrate streaks

**For Students:**
- "In tutorial, you'll design a habit using all four laws"
- "You'll identify which law is your biggest barrier and address it specifically"

**Transition:**
- "One of the most powerful applications of the Four Laws is habit stacking..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Habit Stacking">
## The Implementation Intentions Formula

**The Concept:**
Attach a new habit to an existing habit using a specific formula

**The Formula:**
> "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."
> — **James Clear**

**Why It Works:**
- Leverages existing habit as automatic cue
- No decision fatigue ("When should I do this?")—it's always after X
- Existing habit is already automatic, so new habit piggybacks on that automation

**Examples for Students:**

| Current Habit (Cue) | New Habit (Behavior) | Habit Stack |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| After I pour my morning coffee | I will review my time-block schedule | "After I pour coffee, I will review my schedule" |
| After I close my laptop after class | I will do 2 minutes of spaced repetition flashcards | "After I close laptop, I will review 10 flashcards" |
| After I sit down at my desk | I will put my phone in the drawer | "After I sit at desk, I will put phone in drawer" |
| After I finish dinner | I will walk for 10 minutes | "After dinner, I will walk around block" |
| After I brush my teeth at night | I will lay out tomorrow's clothes | "After brushing teeth, I will prep tomorrow's outfit" |

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Habit stacking is one of the simplest, most effective habit-building strategies"
- "It solves the biggest habit failure point: forgetting to do it"

**Why Existing Habits Are Perfect Cues:**
- You already do them automatically (brushing teeth, eating breakfast, etc.)
- They happen at consistent times
- Brain already has neurological pattern; you're just extending it
- Example: "Finish breakfast" is reliable cue that happens ~7am daily
  - If you stack "After breakfast, review schedule" → automatic by week 3

**The Formula Breakdown:**

**"After [CURRENT HABIT]":**
- Must be specific, not vague
- Good: "After I sit down at my desk"
- Bad: "When I'm ready to study" (too vague, not automatic)
- The current habit is the CUE in the habit loop

**"I will [NEW HABIT]":**
- Must be specific, small action
- Good: "I will write 3 tasks for today"
- Bad: "I will be productive" (not actionable)
- The new habit is the RESPONSE in the habit loop

**Examples Explained:**

**Morning coffee → Review schedule:**
- Coffee is automatic daily ritual
- Stacking schedule review makes planning automatic too
- After 2-3 weeks: Can't drink coffee without thinking about schedule

**Close laptop → Flashcards:**
- End of class is natural transition point
- 2 minutes of spaced repetition right after learning improves retention
- Easy because you're already at computer

**Sit at desk → Phone in drawer:**
- Sitting down is cue
- Immediately removing distraction sets up successful focus
- Becomes automatic: "I sit down, phone goes away, study begins"

**Finish dinner → Walk:**
- Dinner is consistent daily event
- 10-minute walk aids digestion, provides movement break, clears mind
- Much easier than "I should walk sometime today"

**Brush teeth → Lay out clothes:**
- Nighttime routine already automatic
- Adding 2-minute prep task improves morning efficiency
- Reduces decision fatigue next morning

**Building Stacks:**
- You can stack multiple habits into a sequence
- Example: "After I wake up, I will make my bed. After I make my bed, I will do 10 push-ups. After push-ups, I will drink a glass of water."
- Creates automatic morning routine

**Common Mistakes:**

**Mistake 1: Vague current habit**
- "After I wake up" → Wake-up time varies, not reliable cue
- Better: "After my alarm goes off" or "After I sit up in bed"

**Mistake 2: New habit too big**
- "After coffee, I will study for 2 hours" → Too big, will fail
- Better: "After coffee, I will open textbook and read one section" (gateway to longer study)

**Mistake 3: Incompatible habits**
- "After I finish workout, I will practice piano" → Sweaty, tired, not ideal
- Better: Match energy states

**For Students:**
- "Think about your existing routines: morning, between classes, evening"
- "Each routine has stackable moments"
- "In tutorial, you'll design habit stacks for YOUR actual schedule"

**Transition:**
- "Habit stacking works for building new behaviors. But what about breaking bad habits? Let's look at strategies..."
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="framework" title="Breaking Bad Habits">
## Applying the Four Laws in Inversion

**The Inversion Strategy:**
To break a bad habit, invert the Four Laws:

**Example: Reducing Phone Distraction During Study**

| Law | Building Good Habit | Breaking Bad Habit |
|-----|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Cue** | Make it obvious | **Make it invisible**<br>Phone in different room, out of sight |
| **Craving** | Make it attractive | **Make it unattractive**<br>Set phone wallpaper to "Is this urgent or just distraction?" |
| **Response** | Make it easy | **Make it difficult**<br>Delete social media apps, require re-download to use |
| **Reward** | Make it satisfying | **Make it unsatisfying**<br>Accountability partner tracks your focus sessions |

**Key Insight:** Don't rely on willpower—redesign the environment and habit loop

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Breaking bad habits is harder than building good ones—but it's possible"
- "The Four Laws work in reverse"

**Make It Invisible (Remove Cues):**

**The Problem:**
- You can't resist what you see constantly
- Phone on desk = dozens of automatic checks per hour
- Visual cues trigger unconscious behavior

**The Solution:**
- Remove cue entirely
- Phone example:
  - Most effective: Different room during study sessions
  - Moderately effective: Drawer or bag (out of sight)
  - Least effective: Face-down on desk (still visible)
- Social media: Delete apps from phone
  - Can still use on computer (intentional choice)
  - Removes pocket-based impulse checking

**Make It Unattractive (Reframe Craving):**

**The Problem:**
- You're drawn to behavior because you expect reward
- Phone: Expect entertainment, connection, novelty

**The Solution:**
- Highlight COSTS, not just benefits
- Strategies:
  - Mental reframe: "Every time I check phone, I'm choosing distraction over my goals"
  - Visual reminder: Phone wallpaper with "Is this urgent?" forces conscious choice
  - Track wasted time: "I spent 3 hours on Instagram this week = 150 hours/year = nearly 1 month of life"
- Smoking example: Graphic warnings on cigarette packs make habit unattractive
- For students: Calculate GPA impact of distracted studying

**Make It Difficult (Increase Friction):**

**The Problem:**
- Easy habits get repeated
- Phone is always 5 seconds away from any urge

**The Solution:**
- Add steps between urge and behavior
- Phone example:
  - Log out of all accounts (requires re-logging in)
  - Delete apps (requires re-downloading)
  - Use website blockers during study hours (requires disabling)
  - Phone in different room (requires walking to get it)
- Each step gives you moment to reconsider
- Often by the time you walk to other room, urge has passed

**Make It Unsatisfying (Add Immediate Cost):**

**The Problem:**
- Bad habits feel good in the moment (dopamine hit)
- Cost is delayed (poor grades come later)

**The Solution:**
- Add immediate cost
- Strategies:
  - Accountability partner: Report daily "I stayed focused for X hours"
    - Social cost of admitting failure
  - Habit contract: If you check phone during study session, must donate $5 to charity
  - Public commitment: Tell friends your focus goal; they check in weekly
- For students:
  - Study accountability group: Everyone shares focus time daily
  - Pomodoro tracking shared with classmates

**Combining Inversions:**
- Most effective: Apply all four inversions
- Phone distraction example:
  - Invisible: Phone in other room
  - Unattractive: Wallpaper reminder of goals
  - Difficult: Apps deleted, logged out
  - Unsatisfying: Roommate checks if you stayed focused
- After 2-3 weeks: Habit loop weakens significantly

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Bad habits never fully disappear (neural pathways remain)
- But they become much weaker and easier to resist
- Cue might still trigger urge, but response becomes choice instead of automatic

**For Students:**
- "In tutorial, you'll identify one bad habit to break"
- "You'll design inversion strategy using all four laws"

**Transition:**
- "We've covered time-blocking, deep work, habit building. But none of this works if you burn out. Final topic: sustainable performance through energy management..."

# Part 5: Sustainable Performance
## Balancing Intensity and Recovery

<speaker-notes>
**Bridge:**
- "Everything we've discussed—deep work, habit stacking, time-blocking—requires energy"
- "If you don't actively manage renewal, you'll burn out"
</speaker-notes>
</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="quote" title="The Performance-Recovery Cycle">
## Why High Performers Prioritize Rest

**The Oscillation Principle:**
> "High performers are not machines—they oscillate between energy expenditure and renewal"
> — **Schwartz & McCarthy** (2007)

**The Science:**
- Peak performance requires intense effort (stress)
- But stress without recovery = burnout and declining performance
- Recovery isn't laziness—it's physiologically necessary for continued high performance

**The Cycle:**

```
Stress → Recovery → Growth → Stress → Recovery → Growth...
```

**Examples:**
- Athletes: Intense training → rest days → muscle growth → next intense training
- Students: Focused studying → breaks → memory consolidation → next focused studying
- Professionals: High-stakes project → vacation → renewed creativity → next project

**Warning Signs of Insufficient Recovery:**
- Physical: Fatigue, illness, sleep problems
- Emotional: Irritability, anxiety, cynicism
- Mental: Can't focus, brain fog, decreased learning
- Spiritual: "What's the point?" feelings, lack of motivation

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Who here feels guilty taking breaks?" (expect many hands)
- "That guilt is cultural—Vietnamese educational system prizes endless effort"
- "But neuroscience shows breaks aren't optional—they're when learning actually happens"

**The Oscillation Principle:**
- High performance is not linear (more hours = better results)
- High performance is rhythmic (intense effort → recovery → intense effort)
- Think of heart: If it only contracted (never relaxed), you'd die
- Same with brain/body: Only stress (never rest) = breakdown

**The Science of Recovery:**

**Physical level:**
- Muscles grow during rest, not during workout
- Sleep is when memories consolidate (studying without sleep = impaired retention)
- Chronic stress elevates cortisol → impaired immune function, weight gain, cognitive decline

**Mental level:**
- Attention is finite resource that depletes throughout day
- Breaks allow attentional recovery
- "Diffuse mode" thinking (when not focused) often produces creative insights
  - Example: Solution to problem comes during walk, not during intense focus

**Emotional level:**
- Chronic stress without positive emotions depletes emotional energy
- Joy, connection, play restore emotional reserves
- Vietnamese context: Family/social time is recovery, not distraction from work

**The Growth Happens During Recovery:**
- You don't learn during lecture—you learn during sleep that night (memory consolidation)
- You don't get stronger during workout—you get stronger during rest days (muscle repair)
- Insights don't come from more effort—they come from stepping back (incubation period)

**The Cycle:**
- Stress (challenge) signals body/brain: "We need more capacity"
- Recovery allows adaptation (building that capacity)
- Growth results
- Next stress level is now manageable
- Cycle repeats at higher level

**Without Recovery:**
- Stress → No recovery → More stress → Burnout
- Performance actually DECLINES with continued effort
- Example: Studying 12 hours straight → retention worse than studying 4 hours with breaks

**Warning Signs Explained:**

**Physical:**
- Getting sick frequently (weakened immune system from chronic stress)
- Can't fall asleep despite being exhausted (nervous system stuck in stress mode)
- Constant fatigue even after sleeping

**Emotional:**
- Snapping at friends/family over small things
- Feeling anxious even when nothing is objectively wrong
- Cynicism: "Studying doesn't matter, grades are arbitrary" (sign of depletion)

**Mental:**
- Staring at textbook unable to process information
- Re-reading same paragraph 5 times without comprehension
- Making careless errors on tasks you normally handle well

**Spiritual:**
- Loss of connection to why you're in school
- "What's the point?" existential questions
- Going through motions without engagement

**For Students:**
- "If you're experiencing 2+ warning signs, you need recovery NOW"
- "Pushing through = making things worse"
- "Strategic rest = faster return to high performance"

**Transition:**
- "So what does effective recovery look like? Let's get specific..."

## Practical Strategies for Sustainable Performance

**Micro-Recoveries (Throughout Day):**
- 5-minute walk every hour
- 2-minute breathing exercise between tasks
- Stretch breaks during long study sessions
- Social conversation between classes

**Daily Recoveries:**
- 7-9 hours sleep (non-negotiable)
- 20-30 minute exercise (moderate intensity, enjoyable)
- 15 minutes of activity unrelated to work/school (hobby, music, nature)
- Tech-free time before bed (1 hour minimum)

**Weekly Recoveries:**
- One full day with minimal academic work (important, not urgent activities)
- Social connection time with friends/family
- Engaging hobby or creative pursuit
- Physical activity for enjoyment (not just exercise for fitness)

**Semester Recoveries:**
- Breaks between exams (even if just 1 afternoon fully off)
- End-of-semester downtime before starting next term
- Travel or novelty experiences to reset mental state

**The Integration:**
Recovery isn't "when you have time"—it's scheduled like any other important activity

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "Recovery isn't one-size-fits-all—you'll design rituals that work for YOUR life"
- "But research shows certain strategies are universally effective"

**Micro-Recoveries (Every Hour):**

**Why they work:**
- Attention spans naturally wane after 50-90 minutes
- Brief breaks restore focus faster than pushing through
- Movement increases blood flow to brain

**Examples:**
- Pomodoro Technique: 25 min work, 5 min break, repeat
  - After 4 cycles, 20 min longer break
- Hour-based: 50 min focused work, 10 min break
- Physical movement is best: Walk to window, stairs, stretch
  - NOT scrolling phone (that's not recovery, it's different stress)

**For students:**
- Between classes: 10-minute walk outside instead of immediately opening laptop
- Study sessions: Every hour, stand and move
- Library time: Walk outside once per 2 hours

**Daily Recoveries:**

**Sleep (7-9 hours):**
- Most powerful recovery intervention
- During sleep:
  - Memory consolidation (learning becomes long-term)
  - Toxin clearance from brain
  - Emotional regulation
- Sleep deprivation = 2-3 days impaired cognitive function
- "Catching up" on weekends doesn't fully compensate

**Exercise (20-30 minutes):**
- Moderate intensity (can still talk while doing it)
- Releases endorphins, improves mood
- Improves sleep quality
- Doesn't have to be gym: Walk, dance, sports, anything enjoyable
- Timing matters: Morning exercise boosts energy all day; evening exercise aids sleep

**Non-work activity (15 minutes):**
- Something you do purely for enjoyment
- Music, art, reading for pleasure, cooking, gaming (time-limited)
- Allows diffuse-mode thinking (where insights happen)
- Vietnamese students often skip this ("no time for hobbies")—but this IS the recovery that enables performance

**Tech-free before bed:**
- Blue light from screens disrupts melatonin (sleep hormone)
- Content stimulation (news, social media) activates stress response
- 1 hour minimum before bed: No phone, laptop, TV
- Alternative: Reading, journaling, conversation, light stretching

**Weekly Recoveries:**

**One full day minimal academic work:**
- NOT "day off to do nothing"—that often feels unsatisfying
- Instead: Day focused on Important but Not Urgent (Eisenhower Q2)
  - Relationships, hobbies, health, planning, reflection
- For students: Sunday could be relationship/hobby day
  - Exception: Light planning for week (30 min schedule review)

**Social connection:**
- Humans are social animals—isolation depletes emotional energy
- Quality time with friends/family restores emotional reserves
- Vietnamese strength: Strong family/social networks
- Use this cultural asset for recovery

**Hobby/creative pursuit:**
- Something you're learning for pure enjoyment (not career-building)
- Activates different brain regions than academic work
- Sense of progress and mastery (even in non-academic domain) is emotionally energizing

**Physical activity for joy:**
- Not exercise as obligation
- Movement you genuinely enjoy: Dancing, hiking, sports with friends
- Play aspect is key—playfulness restores childlike curiosity and energy

**Semester Recoveries:**

**Between exams:**
- Even half-day completely off helps
- Prevents compound stress across exam period

**Between semesters:**
- Don't immediately start internship or summer courses
- At least 1 week of unstructured time
- Allows nervous system to fully reset

**Travel/novelty:**
- New environments interrupt rumination
- Novelty stimulates dopamine (motivation chemical)
- Doesn't have to be expensive: Day trip to new neighborhood, trying new cuisine, etc.

**The Integration Point:**
- "Recovery isn't what you do when work is done"
- "Recovery is SCHEDULED into your time blocks"
- Example weekly schedule:
  - Daily: 7am-7:30am exercise, 9pm-10pm wind-down routine
  - Weekly: Sunday family/hobby time
  - Semester: Week between exam period and next semester off

**Vietnamese Cultural Adaptation:**
- Western advice: "Set boundaries, say no"
- Vietnamese reality: Family/social obligations not optional
- Adaptation: Reframe family time as emotional energy recovery (not distraction)
  - Family dinner = recovery ritual
  - Use Vietnamese collectivism as recovery asset, not obstacle

**For Students:**
- "In tutorial, you'll design YOUR recovery rituals"
- "You'll schedule them in your time blocks—non-negotiable"

**Transition:**
- "Let's bring everything together with key takeaways..."

## Putting It All Together

**The Week 8 Framework:**

1. **Manage Energy, Not Just Time**
   - Identify your energy patterns across physical, emotional, mental, spiritual dimensions
   - Schedule demanding work when energy is highest

2. **Prioritize Strategically**
   - Use Eisenhower Matrix to identify Quadrant 2 (Important, Not Urgent) activities
   - Invest in Q2 to prevent Q1 crises

3. **Protect Deep Work**
   - Time-block 1-2 hours daily for distraction-free focus
   - Choose rhythmic philosophy (same time daily) for consistency

4. **Build Habit Systems**
   - Use Four Laws to design good habits and break bad ones
   - Habit stack new behaviors onto existing routines

5. **Engineer Recovery**
   - Schedule micro, daily, weekly, and semester recoveries
   - Recovery enables sustained high performance

**Application to Personal Development Plan:**
- Your goals require implementation strategies
- This week provides the frameworks: time-blocking, habit stacks, energy management

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "These five frameworks aren't separate—they work together as a system"

**How They Integrate:**

**Energy management informs prioritization:**
- If mental energy is highest 8-10am, schedule hardest cognitive work then
- If emotional energy is lowest evenings, don't schedule relationship-intensive activities then
- Eisenhower Matrix helps you decide WHAT to do; energy management helps you decide WHEN

**Prioritization guides time-blocking:**
- Eisenhower Q2 activities (important, not urgent) get time-blocked FIRST
  - Example: Deep work on major project before it becomes Q1 crisis
- Q1 activities fit around protected Q2 time
- Q3/Q4 activities get minimal time or eliminated

**Deep work requires habit support:**
- Deep work is effortful—you need habits to support it
- Example habit stack: "After I sit at desk, I will put phone in drawer" (removes distraction for deep work)
- Time-blocking protects time; habits remove friction

**Habits enable recovery:**
- Recovery doesn't happen automatically—you need rituals
- Example: "After dinner, I will walk for 15 minutes" (daily recovery habit)
- Without habits, recovery gets skipped when busy

**Recovery sustains everything:**
- Can't do deep work when burned out
- Can't maintain habits when exhausted
- Energy management and recovery enable the entire system

**Visual System:**
```
Energy Awareness → Prioritization → Time-Blocking → Deep Work → Habit Support → Recovery → Sustained Energy
(cycle repeats)
```

**For Personal Development Plan:**

**Component 1: SMART Goals**
- Week 8 frameworks help you implement goals sustainably
- Example goal: "Improve data analytics skills"
- Implementation using frameworks:
  - Time-block: 8-9:30am daily deep work on analytics practice
  - Habit stack: "After morning coffee, I will complete 3 analytics problems"
  - Energy: Schedule analytics during peak mental energy time
  - Recovery: 10-min break after session, reward progress

**Component 2: 1-Year, 3-Year, 5-Year Plans**
- Long-term goals require sustainable systems
- Cramming doesn't work for skill development
- Consistent daily habits (powered by these frameworks) compound over years

**Component 3: Mentor Integration**

## What You Must Remember

1. **Energy is renewable, time is not** — Manage physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy

2. **Quadrant 2 is where high performance lives** — Important but not urgent activities prevent crises

3. **Deep Work = Time × Intensity** — 2 hours of focused work beats 6 hours distracted

4. **Habits take ~66 days, not 21** — Be patient, be consistent, missing one day is okay

5. **Four Laws: Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying** — Build good habits and break bad ones by manipulating these

6. **Recovery isn't optional** — High performance requires oscillation between stress and renewal

7. **Habit stacking** — "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]" builds automatic behaviors

<speaker-notes>
**Opening:**
- "If you remember seven things from today, remember these"

**Walkthrough:**

**1. Energy is renewable:**
- Biggest paradigm shift
- Stop thinking "I need more time"
- Start thinking "How do I optimize my energy?"
- Schwartz's four dimensions give you diagnostic framework

**2. Quadrant 2:**
- Most students live in Q1 (crisis) and Q4 (escape)
- High performers invest in Q2 (prevention, growth)
- Your PDP is Q2 work—important but not urgent
- Doing it early prevents end-of-semester crisis

**3. Deep Work Formula:**
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Time × Intensity means 2 focused hours > 6 distracted hours
- Protect your attention like you protect your money

**4. 66-day habit timeline:**
- Debunks 21-day myth
- Sets realistic expectations
- Missing one day doesn't restart—curve, not countdown
- Persistence matters more than perfection

**5. Four Laws:**
- Practical toolkit for habit design
- Make good habits: Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying
- Break bad habits: Invisible, Unattractive, Difficult, Unsatisfying
- Works for any behavior change

**6. Recovery enables performance:**
- Not laziness, not optional
- Physiologically necessary
- Scheduled, not "when you have time"
- Micro, daily, weekly, semester—all levels matter

**7. Habit stacking:**
- Simplest, most effective habit technique
- Leverages existing routines
- "After X, I will Y"
- Eliminates decision fatigue

**For Success:**
- These aren't theoretical—implement this week
- Tutorial gives you tools to design YOUR system
- By end of semester, these become automatic

**Transition to Questions:**
- "What questions do you have about applying these frameworks?"

## Open Discussion

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. Which of the four energy dimensions (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual) is your biggest current challenge?
2. What's one bad habit you want to break using the Four Laws?
3. How can you adapt Western productivity advice (e.g., "say no to obligations") to Vietnamese cultural context?

**Office Hours:** By appointment – email wil.hoang@gmail.com

**Next Week:** Growth Mindset & Adaptability
- Fixed vs. growth mindset, neuroplasticity, learning from failure
- Dweck's research and implications for lifelong learning

<speaker-notes>
**Facilitating Discussion:**

**Prompt 1: Energy dimensions**
- Most students will say mental (academic demands) or emotional (pressure, stress)
- Use this to emphasize: Energy management isn't about working harder, it's about working smarter
- Ask: "What's one recovery ritual you could implement this week for your lowest energy dimension?"

**Prompt 2: Bad habit**
- Common answers: Phone distraction, procrastination, poor sleep
- Walk through Four Laws for one student's example
- Show how inversion works in practice

**Prompt 3: Cultural adaptation**
- Critical for Vietnamese students
- Western productivity advice often assumes individualist context ("protect your time, say no")
- Vietnamese collectivist reality: Family/social obligations not optional
- Adaptation strategies:
  - Reframe obligations as energy recovery (family time = emotional energy renewal)
  - Time-blocking helps: "I study 8-10am daily, family time 6-8pm daily"—both protected
  - Habit stack around cultural routines: "After family dinner, I will review tomorrow's schedule"
- Ask class: "How do you balance academic demands with family expectations?"

**Common Student Questions:**

**Q: "I tried time-blocking and it never works—something always comes up"**
- A: Build buffer into schedule. Plan for only 60-70% of day. When unexpected task arises, revise schedule, don't abandon it.

**Q: "How do I stay motivated when habits get boring after a few weeks?"**
- A: Make it attractive (2nd Law). Pair habit with something you enjoy. Also: Remember purpose (spiritual energy)—reconnect to WHY this habit matters.

**Q: "Is it okay to skip recovery when I have exams?"**
- A: No—that's when you need recovery MOST. Performance degrades without it. Strategic breaks improve exam performance.

**Q: "These frameworks seem like they take a lot of time to set up"**
- A: Initial investment (2-3 hours to design system) saves 10+ hours/week of wasted effort. Front-load the thinking.

**Preview Week 9:**
- Growth mindset explains WHY effort matters (but also why effort alone isn't enough)
- Neuroplasticity shows brain is malleable—you can develop any skill
- Learning from failure productively (not just "try harder")
- Builds on Week 8: Habits enable growth mindset in practice

**Closing:**
- "See you in tutorial—bring laptop and readiness to design your productivity system"
- "Everything you build today you can implement starting tomorrow"
