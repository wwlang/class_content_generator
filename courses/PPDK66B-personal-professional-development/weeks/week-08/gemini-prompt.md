# Week 8: Time, Energy & Habit Management

## Slide-by-Slide Content

### Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Time, Energy & Habit Management
**Subtitle:** Building Sustainable High Performance Systems
**Course:** Personal & Professional Development (PPDK66B)
**Week:** 8
**Institution:** National Economics University, IBD Campus

---

### Slide 2: Learning Objectives
**Title:** What You'll Learn Today

**Objectives:**
1. Distinguish between time management and energy management paradigms
2. Apply the Eisenhower Matrix and time-blocking to prioritize work
3. Design habit stacking plans using implementation intentions
4. Schedule deep work sessions while managing attention residue
5. Conduct an energy audit across four dimensions

---

### Slide 3: Session Roadmap
**Title:** Today's Journey

**Four Parts:**
1. **The Energy Paradigm** – Time vs. energy management; Schwartz's four dimensions
2. **Prioritization Systems** – Eisenhower Matrix, time-blocking, Pomodoro
3. **Deep Work** – High-Quality Work formula, attention residue, scheduling philosophies
4. **Habit Formation** – Four Laws, habit stacking, 66-day research

---

### Slide 4: Section Title
**Title:** Part 1: The Energy Paradigm
**Subtitle:** From Managing Time to Managing Energy

**Visual:** Conceptual image showing energy renewal (perhaps circular flow diagram or battery recharging metaphor)

---

### Slide 5: The Core Problem
**Title:** Time is Finite, Energy is Renewable

**Key Contrast:**
- **Time Management Assumption:** Time is the constraint
- **Reality:** Capacity to focus and produce quality work is the constraint

**Example Scenario:**
- Schedule 8 hours for studying
- After 3 hours: Exhausted and unproductive
- **Lesson:** More time ≠ more output without managing energy

---

### Slide 6: Schwartz's Four Energy Dimensions
**Title:** The Four Dimensions of Energy

**Visual:** Create a 2×2 grid or four-quadrant diagram showing:

**1. Physical Energy (Body)**
- Sleep 7-9 hours
- Nutrition
- Movement breaks every 90-120 min
- *When depleted:* Fatigue, poor concentration

**2. Emotional Energy (Feelings)**
- Positive emotions
- Appreciation rituals
- Resilience practices
- *When depleted:* Irritability, low motivation

**3. Mental Energy (Focus)**
- Single-tasking
- Reduce interruptions
- Deep work blocks
- *When depleted:* Scattered attention, shallow work

**4. Spiritual Energy (Purpose)**
- Values alignment
- Meaningful work
- Purpose-driven goals
- *When depleted:* Lack of motivation, cynicism

**Source:** Schwartz & McCarthy (2007), Harvard Business Review

---

### Slide 7: Evidence
**Title:** Why Energy Management Works

**Wachovia Bank Case Study** (Schwartz & McCarthy, 2007)
- Energy renewal program with structured breaks
- **Result:** Experimental group significantly outperformed controls on financial metrics
- Higher engagement and satisfaction
- Sustained performance over 12 months

**Recent Research:**
- Albulescu et al. (2022) meta-analysis: 22 studies
- **Finding:** Short breaks replenish vigor and improve performance
- Break duration and timing are critical for recovery

---

### Slide 8: Application
**Title:** Energy Management in Practice

**Three Strategies:**

**1. Identify Peak Energy Hours**
- Most people: Highest mental energy 2-4 hours after waking
- Schedule cognitively demanding work during peak hours

**2. Build Renewal Rituals**
- 10-minute walk after 90 minutes of focused study
- Physical movement renews mental energy

**3. Align Work with Purpose**
- Connect assignments to career goals and values
- Spiritual energy sustains motivation through difficult tasks

---

### Slide 9: Section Title
**Title:** Part 2: Prioritization Systems
**Subtitle:** Deciding What Deserves Your Energy

---

### Slide 10: The Eisenhower Matrix
**Title:** Urgent vs. Important

**Visual:** Create 2×2 matrix diagram:

|  | **URGENT** | **NOT URGENT** |
|---|---|---|
| **IMPORTANT** | **Q1: Do First** Crises, deadlines, pressing problems | **Q2: Schedule** Planning, prevention, skill development, relationships |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | **Q3: Minimize** Interruptions, some emails, others' priorities | **Q4: Eliminate** Time wasters, distractions, trivial busy work |

**Key Insight:** Most people live in Q1 & Q3. High performers protect Q2 time.

**Note:** Limited empirical validation; conceptually valid practical framework

---

### Slide 11: Time-Blocking Methodology
**Title:** Scheduling Every Minute Intentionally

**What is Time-Blocking?**
Scheduling every minute of your day in advance, dedicating specific blocks to specific work

**Process:**
1. At end of day, create tomorrow's schedule
2. Assign every hour a task category
3. Protect deep work blocks—treat as unmovable
4. Use overflow blocks for tasks that run over
5. Review and adjust daily based on reality

**Newport's Insight:** Time-blocking ensures Quadrant 2 work actually happens instead of being displaced by urgency

**Visual:** Show example daily time-blocked schedule

---

### Slide 12: The Pomodoro Technique
**Title:** Focused Intervals with Strategic Breaks

**Method:**
1. Choose one task
2. Set timer for 25 minutes
3. Work with complete focus until timer rings
4. Take 5-minute break (stand, stretch, walk)
5. After 4 pomodoros, take longer 15-30 minute break

**Benefits:**
- Creates urgency that improves focus
- Frequent breaks prevent mental fatigue
- Visible progress builds motivation
- Structured rhythm aligns with energy management

**Research:** Moderate evidence—scoping review of 32 studies found 88% positive outcomes

**Visual:** Show pomodoro cycle diagram (25min work → 5min break → repeat)

---

### Slide 13: Integration
**Title:** Combining the Three Systems

**Strategic Integration:**
1. **Eisenhower Matrix** → Identify Quadrant 2 priorities (strategic level)
2. **Time-Blocking** → Protect hours for those priorities (tactical level)
3. **Pomodoro** → Maintain focus within blocks (operational level)

**Example:**
- "Research for thesis proposal" = Q2 priority
- Block Monday 8-11am for thesis research
- During that block: 6 pomodoros with breaks
- **Result:** 3 focused hours with built-in energy renewal

---

### Slide 14: Section Title
**Title:** Part 3: Deep Work
**Subtitle:** The Skill of Focused Attention in a Distracted World

---

### Slide 15: Newport's High-Quality Work Formula
**Title:** Quality Output = Time × Focus

**Formula:**
**High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent × Intensity of Focus**

**Two Variables:** Duration AND quality of attention

**Contrast:**
- **Shallow Work:** Non-cognitively demanding, logistical tasks performed while distracted (e.g., checking email, formatting documents)
- **Deep Work:** Cognitively demanding tasks requiring sustained focus (e.g., writing thesis, solving complex problems, learning new frameworks)

**Implication:** 6 hours of distracted studying < 2 hours of deep work

**Visual:** Show equation with emphasis on multiplication (both variables matter)

---

### Slide 16: Attention Residue
**Title:** The Multitasking Penalty

**What is Attention Residue?**
When you switch from Task A to Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow—a residue of Task A remains

**Research:** Sophie Leroy, Business School research
- Task-switching reduces cognitive performance
- Your brain continues processing the previous task even after switching

**Implications:**
- Multitasking is cognitively expensive
- Task-switching creates "cognitive debt"
- Batch similar tasks to minimize switching costs

**Example:** Writing essay → check message → return to essay = lost train of thought + several minutes to rebuild deep focus

---

### Slide 17: Four Deep Work Scheduling Philosophies
**Title:** Choose Your Deep Work Strategy

**Visual:** Create comparison table or four panels:

**1. Monastic**
- Eliminate or radically minimize shallow obligations
- *Example:* Author disconnects from email for months
- *Student fit:* Not realistic for most

**2. Bimodal**
- Divide time into deep and shallow periods (days or weeks)
- *Example:* Block reading week entirely for thesis research
- *Student fit:* Possible during exam prep or project deadlines

**3. Rhythmic** ⭐ **Best for Students**
- Schedule deep work at same time daily—build habit rhythm
- *Example:* 8-11am every weekday morning before classes
- *Student fit:* Sustainable and predictable

**4. Journalistic**
- Fit deep work wherever you can in schedule
- *Example:* Grab 90 minutes when unexpected opening appears
- *Student fit:* Requires advanced skill; not recommended for beginners

---

### Slide 18: Implementing Deep Work
**Title:** Building Your Deep Work Practice

**Five Steps:**

**1. Identify Your Capacity**
- Beginners: Start with 1-2 hours daily
- Maximum for most people: 4 hours daily

**2. Choose Rhythmic Philosophy**
- Same time daily builds automaticity
- Protect morning peak energy hours

**3. Create Shutdown Rituals**
- End work with closure routine
- Review progress, plan tomorrow, say "shutdown complete"

**4. Eliminate Digital Distractions**
- Phone in other room (not just face-down)
- Block social media during deep work hours
- Close email

**5. Track Deep Hours Weekly**
- Measure progress
- Celebrate increases in capacity

---

### Slide 19: Section Title
**Title:** Part 4: Habit Formation Science
**Subtitle:** Building Systems That Make Good Behaviors Automatic

---

### Slide 20: The Habit Loop
**Title:** Cue-Routine-Reward

**Visual:** Create circular flow diagram showing:

**1. CUE (Trigger)**
→ Time, location, preceding event, emotional state
→ *Example:* 8am alarm, arriving at library, closing laptop

**2. ROUTINE (Behavior)**
→ The action you take
→ *Example:* Running 3km, reading 10 pages, breathing exercise

**3. REWARD (Benefit)**
→ Reinforces the behavior
→ *Example:* Endorphins, satisfaction of progress, reduced stress

**Key Insight:** Habits become automatic when cue reliably triggers routine and reward satisfies craving

---

### Slide 21: The Four Laws of Behavior Change
**Title:** Clear's Framework for Building Habits

**Visual:** Create 2×2 table or infographic:

|  | **Build Good Habits** | **Break Bad Habits** |
|---|---|---|
| **1st Law (Cue)** | Make it OBVIOUS Visual cues, implementation intentions, environment design | Make it INVISIBLE Remove cues, hide triggers |
| **2nd Law (Craving)** | Make it ATTRACTIVE Temptation bundling, join culture, reframe mindset | Make it UNATTRACTIVE Highlight costs, reframe negatives |
| **3rd Law (Response)** | Make it EASY Reduce friction, 2-minute rule, automate | Make it DIFFICULT Add friction, increase steps |
| **4th Law (Reward)** | Make it SATISFYING Immediate reinforcement, track progress | Make it UNSATISFYING Accountability, habit contract |

**Research Foundation:** Synthesizes Gollwitzer's implementation intentions, BJ Fogg's behavior design, operant conditioning

---

### Slide 22: Habit Stacking
**Title:** The Implementation Formula

**Formula:**
**"After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"**

**Examples:**
- After I pour my morning coffee, I will write three gratitude statements
- After I close my laptop after class, I will review my notes for 10 minutes
- After I put my head on pillow, I will practice 5 minutes of breathing exercises
- After I sit down for lunch, I will drink one full glass of water

**Why It Works:**
- Uses existing habit's automaticity as trigger
- Specificity creates clear cue (time + location defined)
- Reduces decision fatigue—no question of "when"

**Research:** Gollwitzer's implementation intentions—meta-analysis of 642 tests shows effect size d = 0.65 (strong evidence)

---

### Slide 23: The Timeline
**Title:** How Long Does Habit Formation Take?

**Research:** Lally et al. (2010), European Journal of Social Psychology
- **Study:** 96 participants tracked habits for 84 days
- **Methodology:** Measured automaticity development

**Findings:**
- ❌ **Myth:** 21 days to form a habit
- ✅ **Reality:** 18-254 days; **Median: 66 days**
- Complex behaviors take longer than simple behaviors
- Missing one opportunity did NOT significantly derail habit formation
- Early repetitions show fastest gains (asymptotic curve)

**Implications:**
- Be patient—habits take 2-8 months, not 3 weeks
- Don't catastrophize missing one day
- Start with simple behaviors to build confidence

**Visual:** Show asymptotic curve graph illustrating habit formation over time

---

### Slide 24: Building Your Productivity System
**Title:** Integrating All Four Frameworks

**Visual:** Show layered pyramid or building blocks:

**Foundation:** Energy Management
- Audit four dimensions (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual)
- Design renewal rituals

**Layer 2:** Prioritization
- Use Eisenhower Matrix weekly
- Time-block Quadrant 2 priorities

**Layer 3:** Execution
- Schedule deep work rhythmically
- Use Pomodoro within blocks
- Minimize attention residue

**Layer 4:** Sustainability
- Habit stack 2-3 key behaviors
- Use Four Laws
- Commit for 66+ days
- Track progress

**Key Message:** Systems beat goals. Design a system that makes good behaviors inevitable.

---

### Slide 25: Key Takeaways
**Title:** Five Essential Principles

**1. Energy is renewable; time is not**
→ Manage your energy across four dimensions, not just your schedule

**2. Protect Quadrant 2 time**
→ Use Eisenhower Matrix to identify important work; time-block it before urgency consumes your week
