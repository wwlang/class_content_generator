## During the Field Trip

### Your Role as Tutor/Facilitator

**You are:**
- A professional role model (students will mirror your behavior)
- A facilitator (ensure smooth logistics and positive experience)
- An observer (note student engagement and any concerns)
- A supporter (help students feel comfortable asking questions)

**You are NOT:**
- The center of attention (this is MISA's show and students' learning experience)
- Passive (monitor engagement, intervene if needed)
- A tourist (model active, professional observation)

---

### Arrival and Introduction (15-20 minutes)

**Upon Arrival at MISA:**
1. Thank host contact for receiving you
2. Support student sign-in or security procedures
3. Help organize the group in designated area
4. Introduce yourself and instructors (if not already known to host)
5. Remind students to silence phones completely

**During MISA's Welcome:**
- Model active listening (eye contact, note-taking, engaged posture)
- Observe student engagement levels
- Note any logistical issues to address

---

### Company Presentation/Tour (60-90 minutes)

**Your Responsibilities:**

**Engagement Monitoring:**
- Circulate discreetly if students are spread out during tours
- Note which students are taking notes vs. disengaged
- Gently redirect side conversations with a look or proximity
- Encourage questions if the group seems overly quiet

**Observation Framework Support:**
- Before tour begins, briefly remind students of the 5 observation categories:
  1. Physical Environment
  2. Organizational Culture
  3. Professional Behaviors
  4. Career Pathways
  5. Values in Action
- During tour, occasionally whisper prompts: "Notice the workspace design," "Listen to how they describe collaboration"

**Logistical Support:**
- Ensure group stays together during tours
- Help with any language barriers if Vietnamese/English switching occurs
- Keep time (signal to host if running over if necessary)
- Coordinate restroom breaks if needed

**Professional Conduct:**
- If you observe unprofessional behavior (phone use, side conversations, disrespect), intervene immediately but discreetly
- Pull student aside for private correction rather than public embarrassment
- Document any serious issues for later follow-up

---

### Q&A Session (20-30 minutes)

**Supporting Student Engagement:**

**Before Q&A:**
- Encourage students to reference their prepared questions
- Remind them to build on what they've heard
- Model question quality by asking one thoughtful question yourself (if appropriate and time allows)

**During Q&A:**
- If no students volunteer initially, wait 10 seconds (uncomfortable silence encourages participation)
- If still silent, call on specific students who you know prepared questions
- Ensure diverse participation (not just the same 2-3 students)
- If a question is unclear, help rephrase: "I think what [student] is asking is..."
- Watch the clock - ensure time for multiple students

**Types of Questions to Encourage:**
- Career preparation and skills development
- Work culture and values
- Professional growth and learning
- Advice for students

**Questions to Discourage (redirect privately if asked):**
- Compensation/salary for entry-level roles (inappropriate timing)
- Questions clearly answered on website (shows lack of preparation)
- Overly personal questions about individuals
- Yes/no questions with no follow-up value

**Your Question (Optional):**

If time allows and student questions have dried up, you might ask:
- "What advice would you give to educators preparing students for careers in your industry?"
- "How has your industry changed in the past 5 years, and where do you see it going?"
- "What skills or qualities do you wish more new graduates had when they start?"

This models professional curiosity and can prompt additional student questions.

### Closing and Departure (10 minutes)

**Before Leaving MISA:**
1. Prompt student thank-you (lead applause or verbal thanks)
2. Ensure all students thank hosts individually if meeting in small group
3. Collect any handouts or materials
4. Take group photo if appropriate and permitted
5. Verify all students are present for departure
6. Exchange contact information with MISA host for follow-up

**On the Bus Immediately After:**

**Critical Debrief Window (20-30 minutes on return trip):**

This is Kolb's Stage 2 (Reflective Observation) - capitalize on fresh memories.

1. **Distribute Field Trip Reflection Templates** (if not already distributed)

2. **Guided Reflection Activity (15 minutes):**

   "We're going to capture your observations while they're fresh. You have the reflection template - let's start with Part 1 and 2 together, then you can continue on your own."

   **Prompts:**
   - "What was one moment that stood out to you?"
   - "What surprised you most?"
   - "What did you observe about the workplace culture?"
   - "What emotions did you feel during the visit?"

3. **Independent Completion Time (15 minutes):**

   "Now, use the rest of the bus ride to complete as much of the template as you can. Focus on Parts 1-5. You'll finish the rest later, but capture the details NOW while you remember them."

4. **Remind about Next Steps:**
   - Complete the template fully within 48 hours
   - This material feeds directly into their Reflective Essay (10%)
   - Discuss observations in next mentorship meeting
   - Connect to upcoming PDP work

**Monitor:**
- Students actually completing templates (not just chatting)
- Any students who seem disengaged or upset (check in privately)
- Overall energy level and enthusiasm

## Week 7 Tutorial Integration

### Brief Debrief in Next Tutorial (5-10 minutes)

Even though Week 7 focuses on Transferable Skills & Emotional Intelligence, briefly reconnect to MISA visit:

**Opening Activity:**

"Last week we visited MISA. Let's quickly share one thing you observed that connects to today's topic: transferable skills and emotional intelligence."

**Go around room (1 sentence each):**
- "I noticed strong communication skills when..."
- "The emotional intelligence I observed was..."
- "A transferable skill I saw in action was..."

**Bridge to Week 7 Content:**

"These are exactly the skills we're diving deeper into today. What you observed at MISA - the way employees communicated, collaborated, and problem-solved - are the transferable skills that employers value. Let's learn the frameworks to develop them intentionally."

---

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Student Absence on Field Trip Day

**Prevention:**
- Emphasize mandatory attendance multiple times
- Explain this experience cannot be made up
- Send multiple reminders

**If it happens:**
- Document reason for absence
- If legitimate (illness, family emergency), see if MISA would allow a small make-up visit (unlikely but ask)
- If not possible, student loses access to this material for reflective essay (significant disadvantage)
- Adjust assessment expectations accordingly (consult course instructor)

---

### Challenge 2: Unprofessional Conduct During Visit

**Examples:**
- Phone use during presentations
- Inappropriate dress
- Side conversations
- Disrespectful questions or comments
- Lateness

**In-the-Moment Response:**
- Discreet, immediate correction (proximity, eye contact, or private word)
- Remove from situation if severe (e.g., ask to step outside briefly)
- Apologize to host if disruption was noticeable

**Post-Visit Follow-Up:**
- Private conversation with student about expectations and consequences
- Document incident for course records
- Consider impact on professionalism/participation grade if applicable
- Communicate with course instructor

---

### Challenge 3: Low Engagement During Visit

**Symptoms:**
- Few questions during Q&A
- Students not taking notes
- Looking bored or distracted

**In-the-Moment Response:**
- Model engagement yourself (take notes, ask questions, show interest)
- During breaks, encourage specific students: "What did you find interesting so far?"
- Prompt questions: "Earlier we learned X - does anyone want to know more about that?"

**Post-Visit:**
- Reflection template completion is mandatory (captures learning even if in-the-moment engagement was low)
- Discuss in next tutorial: "What made engagement challenging? What could have helped?"
- Adjust approach for future experiential activities

---

### Challenge 4: Transportation or Logistics Issues

**Examples:**
- Bus delayed or breaks down
- Getting lost en route
- MISA schedule changes
- Weather problems

**Prevention:**
- Confirm everything multiple times
- Have contact numbers for all parties
- Build buffer time into schedule

**If it happens:**
- Stay calm (students will mirror your stress level)
- Communicate immediately with all parties (MISA, students, instructor)
- Have backup plan (reschedule, shorten visit, virtual backup if available)
- Apologize for inconvenience professionally
- Debrief afterward and improve systems

---

### Challenge 5: Students Don't Complete Reflection Template

**Prevention:**
- Start it on the bus (social accountability)
- Explain its importance for assessments
- Set clear deadline (48 hours)

**If deadline missed:**
- Individual follow-up: "I haven't received your template. Is everything okay?"
- Reminder of assessment consequences (can't write strong reflective essay without this)
- Extended deadline with penalty if appropriate
- Document non-completion for course records

---

## Assessment Connection Reminders

### Individual Assignment - Reflective Essay (10%)

**Due:** TBD (after Week 10 guest speaker)
