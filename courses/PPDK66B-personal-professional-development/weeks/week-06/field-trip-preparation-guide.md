## Pre-Trip Preparation (Required)

### 1. Review Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

**From Week 3 readings** - Kolb, A. Y., & Kolb, D. A. (2017). Experiential learning theory as a guide for experiential educators in higher education.

Refresh your understanding of the four stages:

**Stage 1: Concrete Experience**
- Actively engaging with the experience
- Being present and observant
- Participating fully

**Stage 2: Reflective Observation**
- Stepping back to think about the experience
- Examining what happened from different perspectives
- Asking "What did I notice? What stood out?"

**Stage 3: Abstract Conceptualization**
- Making sense of the experience through concepts and theories
- Connecting observations to frameworks from class
- Asking "What does this mean? How does this relate to what I know?"

**Stage 4: Active Experimentation**
- Planning how to apply learning
- Testing new understanding in future situations
- Asking "What will I do differently? How will I use this?"

**During the visit:** You will move through all four stages in real-time.

### 2. Connect to Your Self-Discovery (Week 5)

Before the trip, review your Week 5 self-assessment results:

**MBTI/16 Personalities:**
- How might your personality type fit in this technology environment?
- Would you thrive in this type of workplace culture?
- What aspects might energize or drain you?

**VIA Character Strengths:**
- Which of your signature strengths would be valued here?
- How do you see employees using similar strengths?

**Holland Code (RIASEC):**
- Does MISA's work align with your career interest code?
- What roles might suit your interests?

**CliftonStrengths:**

**Learning Style:**

- Visual: Focus on workspace design, technology, employee interactions
- Auditory: Listen carefully to presentations and Q&A
- Kinesthetic: Engage fully, take notes, ask to see demos if possible

**Reflection Question:** How does visiting a real workplace help you understand where your strengths and interests might fit in the professional world?

### 3. Prepare Observation Questions

Come prepared with **3-5 thoughtful questions** for Q&A sessions. Avoid questions easily answered by their website.

**Strong Questions About Career Paths:**
- What skills do you look for when hiring recent university graduates?
- How do employees typically develop and advance their careers at MISA?
- What training and development opportunities does the company provide?
- What advice would you give to students who want to work in technology but don't have a technical degree?

**Strong Questions About Work Culture:**
- How would you describe the company culture here? What makes MISA unique?
- How has AI changed the way work is done at MISA over the past few years?
- What does a typical workday look like for [specific role you're interested in]?
- How does MISA support work-life balance for employees?

**Strong Questions About Personal Development:**
- How do you personally continue learning and developing professionally?
- What challenges did you face early in your career, and how did you overcome them?
- What's the most important skill you've developed since joining MISA?
- If you could go back and give advice to yourself as a new graduate, what would it be?

**Weak Questions to Avoid:**
- "What does MISA do?" (Visit their website first)
- "How much do you pay?" (Inappropriate for first meeting)
- "Do you have internships?" (Ask HR separately; use this time for learning)
- Yes/no questions that don't lead to meaningful discussion

**Write your 3-5 questions:** Bring them in your notebook to reference during Q&A.

- **Required skills:** What capabilities are mentioned or evident?
- **Growth opportunities:** What paths for advancement do you hear about?
- **Entry points:** How do new graduates enter and contribute?

**Why this matters:** Direct insight into where you might fit and what you need to develop.

#### Category 5: Values in Action

- **Employee engagement:** Do employees seem energized? Proud of their work?
