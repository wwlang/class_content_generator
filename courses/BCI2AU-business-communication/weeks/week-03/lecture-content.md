# Structured Business Writing

<speaker-notes>
Welcome students. Today we explore Structured Business Writing—the frameworks that separate professional communication from amateur writing. This isn't about grammar rules; it's about strategic thinking made visible through structure.

# $50M

**Lost because the recommendation was buried on page 3.**

The investor couldn't find the key point. They moved on to the next deal.

<speaker-notes>
This is a documented story from a McKinsey consultant. An entrepreneur had a brilliant investment opportunity, wrote a detailed email with analysis, data, and recommendations—but structured it like a mystery novel, building to the conclusion. The venture capitalist spent 90 seconds scanning, couldn't find the ask, and assumed it wasn't serious. The deal died. In Vietnamese business, executives at Vingroup, FPT, and Viettel review dozens of proposals weekly—if your main point isn't in the first paragraph, it won't get read. Structure isn't about formality; it's about respecting your reader's time and ensuring your ideas get heard.

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the Pyramid Principle to structure business documents top-down
2. **Construct** compelling document introductions using the SCQA framework
3. **Evaluate** business writing for clarity and concision using Strunk & White principles
4. **Design** executive summaries that lead with conclusions

<speaker-notes>
These four objectives are your toolkit for professional business writing. Objective 1—the Pyramid Principle—is McKinsey's foundational framework: think bottom-up (analyze) but present top-down (conclude first). Objective 2—SCQA—gives you a proven formula for any introduction: Situation, Complication, Question, Answer. Objective 3—clarity and concision—applies Strunk and White's editing principles at the sentence level. Objective 4—executive summaries—demands you lead with conclusions, not build-up. These skills directly prepare you for Week 4's Business Memo (10%), Week 7's Persuasive Proposal (15%), and Week 10's Executive Summary (10%)—together, 35% of your final grade.

## How This Prepares You

**Your Portfolio Journey:**

| Week | Assessment | What You'll Apply Today |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Week 4** | Business Memo (10%) | Pyramid structure, SCQA opening |
| **Week 7** | Persuasive Proposal (15%) | Top-down argumentation, clarity |
| **Week 10** | Executive Summary (10%) | Leading with conclusions, concision |

**Today's lecture + tutorial = 35% of your final grade**

<speaker-notes>
Everything we cover today supports three portfolio assessments worth 35% of your grade. Week 4's memo requires Pyramid Principle structure and SCQA introduction—you'll practice both today. Week 7's proposal builds on Week 4 by adding persuasive techniques to the structural foundation. Week 10's executive summary is the ultimate test: distill a complex report to one page, leading with your recommendation. Barbara Minto, who created the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey, discovered that the problem wasn't writing—it was thinking. Once you structure your thoughts clearly, the writing follows naturally. Students who master these frameworks in Week 3 consistently score 10-15% higher on all three assessments.

<slide number="5" layout="section-break" title="Roadmap">

## Today's Journey

1. **The Pyramid Principle** (25 min)
   Think bottom-up, present top-down

2. **SCQA Framework** (20 min)
   Introductions that hook readers

3. **Clarity & Concision** (20 min)
   Making every word count

4. **Application Workshop** (15 min)
   Transforming weak writing to strong

5. **Wrap-up & Resources** (10 min)

<speaker-notes>
We have 90 minutes structured into five progressive segments. Segment 1 is longest because the Pyramid Principle is foundational—everything else builds on this. Notice how this roadmap itself demonstrates the Pyramid Principle: I'm telling you the "what" (segments) before the "how" (details). This makes the lecture feel manageable rather than overwhelming. Each segment builds toward more applied skills, culminating in a hands-on editing workshop before tutorial. You'll leave today with frameworks you can apply immediately to your Week 4 memo draft.

# SEGMENT 1
## The Pyramid Principle

**The framework used by McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and every M7 business school**

Developed by Barbara Minto at McKinsey (1963-1973)

<speaker-notes>
Barbara Minto was the first female consultant hired at McKinsey in 1963. Partners kept asking her to fix other consultants' unclear reports. She identified the core problem: people were presenting their thinking process rather than their conclusions. Traditional writing builds to a conclusion—"I analyzed A, then B, then C, therefore I recommend D." Pyramid writing reverses this—"I recommend D because of A, B, and C." The reader gets the answer first, then chooses how deep to go. Minto codified this into the Pyramid Principle, which became McKinsey's firm standard. Today, it's required at all major consulting firms and M7 business schools. This framework is non-optional in professional business communication.

## The Pyramid Structure

```
                 MAIN ANSWER
                /     |      \
           Arg 1    Arg 2    Arg 3
          /  |  \  /  |  \  /  |  \
       Data Data Data Data Data Data
```

**Three Rules:**
1. Ideas above must summarize those below
2. Grouped ideas must be logically the same kind
3. Ideas must follow logical order (chronological, structural, comparative, or deductive)

<speaker-notes>
The pyramid has three levels. Top level is your governing thought—the single recommendation or conclusion you want your reader to accept. Second level contains your supporting arguments, typically three, grouped logically. Third level provides the data, facts, and examples that prove each argument. Rule 1 ensures executives can stop reading at any level and still get value—they might only read the top, or top plus arguments, depending on their needs. Rule 2 prevents mixing argument types—if your arguments are financial viability, market timing, and operational readiness, don't throw in a random competitive analysis. Rule 3 demands you order arguments logically—chronologically (past, present, future), structurally (by business unit), comparatively (by importance), or deductively (if A and B, then C). Vietnamese example: "We should open a Hanoi office" supported by market demand (25% growth), competitive timing (competitors entering now), and operational readiness (qualified staff available). Each argument answers "why should we?" at the same logical level.

<slide number="8" layout="comparison" title="Think Bottom-Up, Present Top-Down">

## Think Bottom-Up, Present Top-Down

| **How You Think (Analysis)** | **How You Present (Document)** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1. Gather data | 1. State recommendation |
| 2. Identify patterns | 2. Provide 3 supporting arguments |
| 3. Form arguments | 3. Share key data as needed |
| 4. Reach conclusion | 4. Offer next steps |

**The magic: You do the hard thinking so your reader doesn't have to.**

<speaker-notes>
This is the most important concept in today's lecture—the fundamental shift in how you communicate. The Pyramid Principle doesn't change how you think; it changes how you present. Left column shows inductive reasoning: you collect evidence, identify patterns, build arguments, and reach a conclusion. This is essential for good analysis. Right column shows deductive presentation: you lead with the conclusion. Your reader trusts you've done the analysis—they just want the answer. Most people write documents that mirror their thinking process, which exhausts readers who must follow your entire analytical journey. Compare two responses to "Should we approve the vendor?": Bad answer builds up slowly—"Well, I reviewed 15 vendors, compared their pricing structures, analyzed customer reviews..." Good answer leads with conclusion—"Yes, approve them. They're 20% cheaper, have 4.8-star reviews, and can start Monday." Same thinking, different presentation. The second respects the reader's time.

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Case Study: McKinsey Recommendation">

## Case Study: McKinsey Recommendation

**Client Question:** Should we enter the Vietnamese electric vehicle market?

**Pyramid Structure:**

**Recommendation (Top):**
Yes, enter now with a $50M investment targeting premium urban buyers in Hanoi and HCMC.

**Supporting Arguments (Level 2):**
1. **Market timing:** EV adoption growing 40% year-over-year in major cities
2. **Competitive gap:** Only 2 established players, gap in premium segment
3. **Financial return:** Projected 3-year breakeven with 25% gross margin

**Data (Level 3):** Market research, competitor analysis, financial models

<speaker-notes>
This realistic scenario shows how McKinsey structures recommendations. The main answer is clear, specific, and actionable—not "maybe" or "it depends." It includes key details: investment amount ($50M), target segment (premium urban), and geography (Hanoi and HCMC). The three supporting arguments are MECE—Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive—they cover market pull, competitive positioning, and financial viability without overlap. An executive could read just the recommendation and make a decision. If they want more confidence, they read the three arguments. If they need evidence, they drill into the data. In Vietnamese business culture, this structure respects hierarchy—the CEO gets the answer in one sentence, the CFO gets financial details at level 2, and analysts get full models at level 3. Everyone gets what they need at their level.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="framework" title="The MECE Principle">

## The MECE Principle

**MECE = Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

- **Mutually Exclusive:** No overlap between ideas
- **Collectively Exhaustive:** Nothing relevant is missing

**Bad Example (Violates MECE):**
1. Increase revenue
2. Expand into new markets ← *Overlaps with #1*
3. Improve customer retention

**Good Example (MECE):**
1. Acquire new customers
2. Increase revenue per customer
3. Improve customer retention

<speaker-notes>
MECE (pronounced "MEE-see") is the logic check for your pyramid structure—it ensures your arguments don't overlap and collectively cover everything relevant. In the bad example, "Expand into new markets" is just one way to "increase revenue," so these overlap, violating mutual exclusivity. The good example fixes this: the three ways to grow revenue are distinct—acquire new customers, sell more to existing customers, and keep customers longer. Together, these three cover all major growth levers. Think of MECE like organizing a closet: every item has exactly one place (mutually exclusive), and there's a place for every item (collectively exhaustive). Vietnamese students often ask "How many supporting arguments should I have?" Answer: however many it takes to be exhaustive—usually 3, sometimes 2 or 4, rarely more than 5. If you have 6 arguments, they probably overlap—look for ways to combine them.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="11" layout="content" title="Logical Ordering Methods">

## Logical Ordering Methods

**Rule 3: Ideas must follow logical order**

Four ordering methods for your supporting arguments:

1. **Chronological:** Past → Present → Future
   *Example: "We missed Q1 targets, Q2 is tracking below, Q3 requires intervention"*

2. **Structural:** By division, department, or geography
   *Example: "North region is underperforming, Central is meeting targets, South is exceeding"*

3. **Comparative:** By importance, priority, or magnitude
   *Example: "Cost reduction is critical, revenue growth is important, brand awareness is beneficial"*

4. **Deductive:** If A and B, then C
   *Example: "Costs are rising 10% annually, revenue is flat, therefore we must cut expenses"*

<speaker-notes>
Rule 3 of the Pyramid Principle demands logical ordering—your supporting arguments must follow a coherent sequence, not random order. Chronological ordering works when timing matters—past problems, current state, future needs. Structural ordering works when you're analyzing different parts of a system—by department, by geography, by product line. Comparative ordering works when arguments have different weights—rank them by importance, most critical first. Deductive ordering works when you're building a logical proof—if premise A and premise B are true, then conclusion C must follow. Choose the ordering method that best fits your content. For the Vietnamese EV market example from Slide 9, the three arguments use comparative ordering: market timing (most urgent), competitive gap (strategic), financial return (validating). If we reordered them randomly—financial, market, competitive—the argument would feel disjointed. Wrong ordering confuses readers even when arguments are individually strong. Test your order by asking: "Does this sequence make intuitive sense to my reader?"

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Pyramid Principle: Common Mistakes">

## Pyramid Principle: Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Burying the Lead**
❌ "After analyzing data from 15 sources over 3 months..."
✅ "We should approve the project. Here's why..."

**Mistake 2: Non-MECE Arguments**
❌ Arguments: Cost savings, Efficiency gains, Reduced waste *(all overlap)*
✅ Arguments: Lower costs, Faster delivery, Higher quality *(MECE)*

**Mistake 3: Mixing Logical Levels**
❌ "Hire 3 engineers" + "Improve product quality" *(tactic + goal)*
✅ "Hire 3 engineers" + "Upgrade testing tools" + "Implement code review" *(all tactics)*

<speaker-notes>
These are the three most common errors students make when applying Pyramid Principle. Mistake 1—burying the lead—happens when you write chronologically, describing your analysis journey before stating your conclusion. Readers lose patience and stop reading. Always lead with your answer, then provide supporting arguments. Mistake 2—non-MECE arguments—happens when supporting points overlap in meaning. "Cost savings," "efficiency gains," and "reduced waste" all describe the same benefit from different angles. Better: "Lower costs" (financial), "Faster delivery" (operational), "Higher quality" (customer value)—now they're mutually exclusive. Mistake 3—mixing logical levels—happens when you combine goals with tactics, or strategies with implementation steps. "Hire 3 engineers" is a specific action; "Improve product quality" is a broad outcome—they're at different logical levels. Keep all arguments at the same level of abstraction. To check for this error, ask: "Are all my arguments answering the same question?" If your main point is "How to improve the product?" all three arguments should be strategies, not a mix of strategies and tactics. Vietnamese students often struggle with Mistake 3 because they want to show both strategic thinking and practical detail—but mixing them creates confusion. Separate strategic arguments from tactical implementation steps.

<slide number="13" layout="section-break" title="SEGMENT 2: SCQA Framework">

# SEGMENT 2
## SCQA Framework

**How to write document introductions that hook your reader**

**S**ituation → **C**omplication → **Q**uestion → **A**nswer

<speaker-notes>
SCQA is part of Minto's Pyramid Principle—it's the proven structure for introducing any business document. Every business document needs a strong opening that creates context and urgency before diving into details. SCQA gives you a four-part formula: Situation (indisputable context the reader accepts), Complication (the problem creating urgency), Question (what naturally arises from the complication), and Answer (your recommendation—the top of your pyramid). This typically takes one paragraph, about 4-6 sentences. Think of SCQA like a movie trailer: establish the scene (Situation), create tension (Complication), pose the central question (Question), and hint at the resolution (Answer). The goal is to make your reader care before you present your full argument. SCQA works for emails, memos, reports, proposals, and presentations.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="SCQA Breakdown">

## SCQA Breakdown

**S — Situation:** Indisputable context the audience already accepts
> *"Our customer retention rate has held steady at 85% for 3 years."*

**C — Complication:** The problem or change creating urgency
> *"However, our top competitor just launched a loyalty program, and we're seeing early churn signals in the premium segment."*

**Q — Question:** What naturally arises from the complication
> *"How should we respond to protect our customer base?"*

**A — Answer:** Your recommendation (the pyramid top)
> *"We should launch a premium-tier loyalty program by Q2, focusing on our top 20% of customers."*

<speaker-notes>
Let's break down each element. Situation must be something your audience already agrees with—no debate here. "85% retention for 3 years" is factual and neutral. The reader nods and continues reading. Complication creates tension and urgency—this is what changed or what's wrong. "Competitor launched loyalty program" introduces a threat. "Early churn signals" makes it specific and immediate, not theoretical. Question should arise naturally from the complication—your reader should be thinking this question before you state it. If they're not, your complication wasn't strong enough. Answer is your governing thought—the top of your pyramid. Notice it's specific: "premium-tier," "by Q2," "top 20%." Vague answers like "we should do something about loyalty" fail because they're not actionable. In Vietnamese business context, SCQA replaces weak openings like "I am writing to propose a loyalty program because programs are important..." with strategic context that respects the reader's time.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="content" title="SCQA in Action: Full Email Opening">

## SCQA in Action: Full Email Opening

**To:** Regional Director
**Subject:** Premium Loyalty Program Recommendation

**Email Opening:**

Our customer retention rate has held steady at 85% for three years, contributing to predictable revenue growth. **[S]** However, our top competitor launched a points-based loyalty program last month, and we're seeing early churn signals among premium customers—15% increase in support tickets asking about loyalty benefits. **[C]** How should we respond to protect our most valuable customer segment? **[Q]**

We should launch a premium-tier loyalty program by Q2, focusing on the top 20% of customers who generate 60% of our revenue. **[A]** This approach will require $200K investment but is projected to reduce churn by 5 percentage points, protecting $2M in annual revenue.

**The next paragraph would present your 3 supporting arguments...**

<speaker-notes>
This realistic business email shows SCQA in practice, formatted as a professional message. Situation establishes the baseline—"85% retention for three years, predictable growth." This is neutral and factual. Complication introduces a two-part problem: competitive action (loyalty program launch) plus data signal (15% increase in support tickets). The specificity—"last month," "15% increase"—makes it credible and urgent. Question is clear and action-oriented. Any business leader reading this would naturally ask this question. Answer provides the specific recommendation with key details—when (Q2), who (top 20%), cost ($200K), and impact ($2M protected). The second sentence adds financial justification. Compare this to how most students write: "I am writing to propose a loyalty program. Loyalty programs are important for customer retention. There are many benefits to loyalty programs..." SCQA eliminates all filler and gets straight to strategic context. The Regional Director gets full context in 15 seconds of reading.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="comparison" title="SCQA Variations by Context">

## SCQA Variations by Context

| **Context** | **Situation** | **Complication** |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Proposal** | Current state | Gap or opportunity |
| **Status Update** | Project milestone | Blocker or risk |
| **Recommendation** | Industry trend | Competitive threat |
| **Request** | Team capacity | Resource constraint |

**The pattern stays the same; the content adapts.**

<speaker-notes>
SCQA is flexible—the four-part structure works for any business writing scenario, you just adapt the content. For proposals: Situation might be "We currently use Excel for inventory tracking," Complication is "but manual entry creates $50K in errors annually." For status updates: Situation is "Project is 80% complete and on budget," Complication is "but the vendor delayed critical component shipment by 2 weeks." For recommendations: Situation is "Industry is shifting to cloud infrastructure," Complication is "our on-premise servers create security vulnerabilities." For requests: Situation is "Team is operating at 90% capacity," Complication is "new client project would push us to 120% capacity without additional headcount." In every case, Situation establishes the baseline, Complication creates urgency, Question arises naturally, and Answer provides your recommendation. Vietnamese students sometimes struggle with this level of directness, but in professional business settings—especially international contexts—clarity equals respect for your reader's time. Your Week 4 Business Memo will use the Recommendation context.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Writing Strong Complications">

## Writing Strong Complications

**The Complication creates urgency. Make it concrete and specific.**

**Weak Complications (vague, abstract):**
- "There might be some issues with the current approach"
- "Competition is increasing"
- "We should improve customer satisfaction"

**Strong Complications (specific, urgent):**
- "Current approach created $47K in errors last quarter—12% of budget"
- "Three competitors entered our market in Q1; we've lost 8% market share"
- "Customer satisfaction dropped from 4.2 to 3.6 stars; NPS fell 15 points"

**Formula: Specific problem + Quantified impact + Time urgency**

<speaker-notes>
The Complication is where most SCQA introductions fail. Weak complications are vague and theoretical—they don't create urgency. "There might be some issues" doesn't compel action. "Competition is increasing" is obvious and doesn't tell the reader why they should care now. Strong complications follow a formula: specific problem plus quantified impact plus time urgency. "$47K in errors last quarter" is specific and quantified. "12% of budget" shows materiality. "Last quarter" shows this is current, not historical. For the competition example, "three competitors entered in Q1" is specific timing, "8% market share loss" is quantified impact, and Q1 implies this is recent and accelerating. Customer satisfaction example provides both absolute change (4.2 to 3.6) and relative change (15-point NPS drop). Vietnamese business context: executives are busy and skeptical—you must prove this is worth their attention. Numbers create credibility and urgency. If you don't have exact numbers, acknowledge the limitation: "Preliminary data suggests approximately 10% decline." Never use vague language when specificity is possible.

<slide number="18" layout="section-break" title="SEGMENT 3: Clarity & Concision">

# SEGMENT 3
## Clarity & Concision

**Making every word count**

Based on *The Elements of Style* by Strunk & White
(#1 most-assigned text in US higher education)

<speaker-notes>
We've covered structure (Pyramid Principle) and introduction (SCQA). Now we shift to sentence-level editing—the final polish that separates good writing from great writing. *The Elements of Style* was written in 1918 by William Strunk Jr. at Cornell University and updated by E.B. White in 1959. It has sold over 10 million copies and is the most frequently assigned book in US university syllabi according to the Open Syllabus Project. The book contains over 100 rules, but we'll focus on the three most important for business writing. Stephen King said: "Any word you can cut should be cut." Vietnamese students often write long, complex sentences thinking it sounds more professional or academic, but in English business writing, short and direct equals professional. Long and complex equals unclear, even if grammatically perfect.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="quote" title="Rule 1: Omit Needless Words">

> "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts."
>
> — William Strunk Jr.

**Translation: Make every word earn its place.**

<speaker-notes>
This is the number one rule from *The Elements of Style* and the hardest to master. "Omit needless words" doesn't mean "make all sentences short"—it means eliminate words that add no meaning or clarity. Think of writing like engineering: every component must serve a function. Concise doesn't equal simplistic; concise equals precise. Most first drafts contain 20-30% unnecessary words—the difference between professionals and students is that professionals edit ruthlessly before sending. Strunk's metaphor is perfect: a technical drawing with unnecessary lines looks cluttered and confusing. Same with writing—extra words obscure your message rather than clarify it. Vietnamese students often add transitional phrases like "I would like to say that" or "It is important to note that" or "In my opinion, I think that..." These phrases add zero meaning—they're filler that should be ruthlessly cut in editing.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="comparison" title="Omit Needless Words: Examples">

## Omit Needless Words: Examples

| **Before (Wordy)** | **After (Concise)** | **Words Saved** |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| In order to improve performance | To improve performance | 2 words |
| Due to the fact that | Because | 4 words |
| At this point in time | Now | 3 words |
| In the event that | If | 3 words |
| It is important to note that | [Delete entirely] | 6 words |
| In my opinion, I believe that | [Delete entirely] | 5 words |

**In a 500-word memo, eliminating these saves 50+ words (10% reduction).**

<speaker-notes>
Here are the most common offenders in business writing—they appear in nearly every first draft, including from experienced professionals. "In order to" should always be shortened to just "to"—the meaning never changes. "Due to the fact that" should always become "because"—4 words become 1 with identical meaning. "At this point in time" is a pompous way to say "now." "In the event that" means "if." "It is important to note that" should be deleted entirely—if it's important, state it; the reader will decide importance. "In my opinion, I believe that" is redundant—of course it's your opinion, you're the one writing. These phrases feel formal and academic, so students think they sound professional, but they actually signal unclear thinking and pad word count. McKinsey has an internal editing rule among partners: "If you can cut a word without losing meaning, cut it." Partners literally cross out these phrases in consultant drafts with red pen. Students sometimes worry concise writing sounds too simple or direct, but the truth is it sounds confident and competent, not weak or casual.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="More Phrases to Eliminate">

## More Phrases to Eliminate

**Common padding phrases that add zero value:**

| **Delete This** | **Say This Instead** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| For the purpose of | To, For |
| In regard to | About |
| With reference to | About |
| Prior to | Before |
| Subsequent to | After |
| In close proximity to | Near |
| Exhibits a tendency to | Often, Tends to |
| Has the ability to | Can |
| Is able to | Can |
| In spite of the fact that | Although, Despite |

**These bloat your writing without adding meaning or formality.**

<speaker-notes>
This slide extends Rule 1 with additional common offenders. "For the purpose of" always simplifies to "to" or "for." "In regard to" and "with reference to" both mean "about"—use the simpler word. "Prior to" sounds more formal than "before" but means exactly the same—business writing values clarity over formality, so use "before." Same with "subsequent to"—just say "after." "In close proximity to" is three words for "near." "Exhibits a tendency to" is pompous language for "often" or "tends to." "Has the ability to" and "is able to" both mean "can"—the one-word version is stronger and clearer. "In spite of the fact that" should be "although" or "despite." Vietnamese students often choose the longer phrase thinking it sounds more professional or academic, but in business English, shorter and simpler equals more professional. These long phrases actually signal that the writer is insecure or trying to inflate simple ideas. Confident, experienced professionals use simple, direct language. When you edit your Week 4 memo, search for every phrase in the left column and replace with the right column version—your writing will immediately sound stronger and more confident.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="framework" title="Rule 2: Use Active Voice">

## Rule 2: Use Active Voice

**Passive Voice (Weak):**
"The report was completed by the team."
*Subject receives action*

**Active Voice (Strong):**
"The team completed the report."
*Subject performs action*

**Why active voice?**
- Clearer responsibility and accountability
- Shorter, more direct sentences
- More confident, assertive tone

<speaker-notes>
Active versus passive voice is the difference between confident and weak business writing. Most business writing should be active—aim for 80% or more of your sentences. Passive voice follows the pattern: [Thing] was [verbed] by [doer]. Active voice follows the pattern: [Doer] [verbed] [thing]. When should you use passive? When the actor is unknown or irrelevant—"The server was hacked overnight" is acceptable because you don't know who hacked it. But when clarity and accountability matter, use active voice. Compare: "The meeting was scheduled by Sarah" (passive, weak) versus "Sarah scheduled the meeting" (active, clear). Business benefit of active voice: it clarifies who is responsible for what. "We recommend approving the budget" versus "It is recommended that the budget be approved"—the first shows ownership and confidence, the second sounds evasive. Vietnamese students sometimes use passive voice to sound polite or to avoid appearing too direct, but in English business writing, active voice equals directness equals respect and professionalism. Passive voice can signal evasion or weak leadership.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="content" title="Active Voice: More Examples">

## Active Voice: More Examples

**Transform these passive constructions to active:**

| **Passive (Weak)** | **Active (Strong)** |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| The proposal was rejected by management | Management rejected the proposal |
| Errors were found in the data | We found errors in the data |
| A decision will be made by Friday | We will decide by Friday |
| The policy was implemented to reduce costs | We implemented the policy to reduce costs |
| It is believed that sales will increase | We believe sales will increase |
| It was determined that... | We determined that... |

**Notice: Active voice is shorter AND clearer.**

<speaker-notes>
These examples demonstrate how passive voice makes writing weaker, longer, and less clear. In every case, the active version is both shorter and more direct. "The proposal was rejected by management" is 7 words; "Management rejected the proposal" is 4 words—same meaning, 43% shorter. Passive voice hides agency—"errors were found" doesn't tell you who found them. Active voice clarifies—"we found errors" shows ownership. "A decision will be made by Friday" sounds bureaucratic and evasive—who will make this decision? "We will decide by Friday" is clear and accountable. "It is believed that sales will increase" is passive and vague—believed by whom? "We believe sales will increase" shows confidence and ownership. The construction "It was determined that" or "It is believed that" or "It is recommended that" should always be replaced with active verbs: "We determined," "We believe," "We recommend." Vietnamese students often use these impersonal constructions thinking they sound objective or formal, but in business English they sound weak and evasive. When you want to sound authoritative and confident, use active voice with clear subjects—especially "we" when speaking for your team or organization.

<slide number="24" layout="comparison" title="Rule 3: Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language">

## Rule 3: Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language

| **Vague** | **Specific** |
|-----------|--------------|
| Sales increased significantly | Sales increased 23% quarter-over-quarter |
| Many customers complained | 47 customers filed complaints (15% of total base) |
| We need to improve soon | We need to implement changes by March 15 |
| The project is going well | The project is 85% complete, on budget, 3 days ahead of schedule |

**Specificity builds credibility.**

<speaker-notes>
This rule separates professional business writing from student writing. Vague language makes you sound uncertain or inexperienced; specific language builds trust and credibility. Words like "significantly," "many," "soon," "well"—these are vague qualifiers that make readers immediately ask: "How much? How many? When exactly? By what measure?" If you have specific data, use it. If you don't have precise data, get it before writing. Acceptable exception: when exact data isn't available, acknowledge the limitation—"Approximately 50 customers" or "We estimate 20% increase" signals you know precision matters but don't have it yet. Compare two consultants presenting to a client: Consultant A says "Revenue will improve if we implement this strategy." Consultant B says "Revenue will increase by $2M annually if we implement this strategy by Q2." Who sounds more credible and experienced? Consultant B—specificity equals expertise and confidence. Vietnamese students sometimes avoid specifics for fear of being wrong or held accountable, but it's better to be specific and adjust later based on new information than to be vague and ignored.

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Replace Vague Words with Specifics">

## Replace Vague Words with Specifics

**Common vague words to avoid:**

| **Vague Word** | **Replace With** |
|----------------|------------------|
| Soon | By March 15, Within 2 weeks, Q2 2025 |
| Recently | Last Tuesday, In November, Q4 2024 |
| Many | 127, 34%, Two-thirds |
| Few | 3, 12%, Less than 5% |
| Large | $2.4M, 340 units, 15,000 sq ft |
| Significant | 23%, $450K, 3.2x increase |
| Improve | Increase by 15%, Reduce errors to <2%, Achieve 4.5 stars |
| Several | 5, 12, Between 8-10 |

**Default to numbers whenever possible.**

<speaker-notes>
Here's a comprehensive list of vague words that undermine your credibility and their specific replacements. "Soon" could mean tomorrow or next year—always provide an actual deadline or timeframe. "Recently" is similarly vague—"last Tuesday" or "in November" or "Q4 2024" gives readers precise context. "Many" and "few" are relative terms with no meaning—replace with actual counts or percentages. "Large" is meaningless without context—$2.4M, 340 units, or 15,000 square feet provides scale. "Significant" means different things to different readers—23% is specific and lets readers judge significance themselves. "Improve" is the most common vague verb in business writing—improve how much? By what measure? Replace with specific targets: "increase by 15%," "reduce errors to less than 2%," "achieve 4.5-star rating." "Several" typically means 3-10 but is ambiguous—if you know the exact number, use it. Vietnamese cultural context: indirectness and approximation are often valued in Vietnamese communication as a form of politeness or flexibility. But in international business English, this reads as uncertainty or lack of preparation. When writing for Western business audiences or international contexts, default to numbers and specifics. You can still be diplomatic and polite while being specific.

## Editing Exercise: Before Version

**Memo Draft (First Version):**

*"In order to improve customer satisfaction, it is recommended that a new feedback system should be implemented. Due to the fact that many customers have expressed concerns about response times, it is important that we address this issue soon. The new system will allow customers to rate their experience, and improvements will be made based on the feedback that is received."*

**Word count:** 65 words
**Problems:** Passive voice, needless words, vague language

**What would you cut or change?**

<speaker-notes>
This is how most first drafts look—including from business professionals, not just students. The difference: professionals edit ruthlessly before sending; students often submit first drafts thinking they're complete. Let's identify the problems. Needless words: "In order to" should become "To," "Due to the fact that" should become "Because," "it is important that" should be deleted entirely. Passive voice: "It is recommended that... should be implemented" should become "We recommend implementing," "improvements will be made" should become "we will make improvements," "feedback that is received" should become "customer feedback." Vague language: "many customers" (how many?), "soon" (when exactly?), "improvements" (what kind specifically?). Overall, the tone is weak and bureaucratic—it sounds like the writer is hiding or avoiding responsibility. In the next slide, we'll see the same message after applying all three editing rules.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Editing Exercise: After Version">

## Editing Exercise: After Version

**Memo Draft (Edited Version):**

*"To improve customer satisfaction, we recommend implementing a new feedback system by March 31. Over 120 customers (38% of Q4 survey respondents) reported slow response times. The new system will allow customers to rate their experience on a 5-point scale, and we will address issues scoring below 3.0 within 48 hours."*

**Word count:** 54 words (17% shorter)
**Improvements:** Active voice, specific data, clear deadlines

<speaker-notes>
Here's the same message after applying all three editing rules—the transformation is dramatic. We cut 11 words (from 65 to 54, a 17% reduction) by changing "In order to" to "To," replacing "Due to the fact that" with a direct statement, and deleting "it is important that." Active voice appears throughout: "We recommend" instead of "It is recommended that," "we will address" instead of "improvements will be made." Specific language replaces all vague terms: "many customers" becomes "120 customers (38% of Q4 survey respondents)," "soon" becomes "by March 31," "improvements" becomes "address issues scoring below 3.0 within 48 hours," and we added specificity about the 5-point scale. The edited version is shorter, clearer, more confident, and more credible. Notice it doesn't lose any important meaning—in fact, it adds specificity while being shorter. This is the goal of editing: say more with fewer words. The writer now sounds like a decision-maker and leader, not just a report-writer describing problems.

<slide number="28" layout="framework" title="Purpose-Person-Point Framework">

## Purpose-Person-Point Framework

**Before you write anything, answer 3 questions:**

1. **Purpose:** What result do I want?
   *(Inform? Request? Persuade?)*

2. **Person:** Who is my reader?
   *(What do they need to understand my message?)*

3. **Point:** What's my essential message?
   *(What must they know or do?)*

**Clear thinking → Clear writing**

*Source: Danziger, E. (2024). How to take your business writing from "average" to "great." Harvard Business Review.*

<speaker-notes>
This framework from a 2024 Harvard Business Review article by Elizabeth Danziger addresses the pre-writing thinking that prevents unclear drafts. Most unclear writing comes from unclear intent—the writer starts typing before knowing what they want to achieve. Purpose: are you informing (sharing facts with no action needed), requesting (asking for approval or resources), or persuading (changing someone's mind or behavior)? If you don't know your purpose, your reader won't either. Person: what does your reader already know about this topic? What do they need to know to make a decision? A technical audience needs different details than an executive audience—don't explain what they already know, and don't skip what they need. Point: can you state your core message in a single sentence? If not, you're not ready to write yet. This becomes your SCQA Answer or your Pyramid top. The article includes a case study: Erica, a staff engineer, struggled for an hour writing a follow-up email because she didn't know if her purpose was to confirm receipt, request a signed document, or highlight her firm's capabilities. Once she clarified Purpose (request signature), the email took 5 minutes. Many students waste hours on bad drafts when 5 minutes of pre-writing clarity would eliminate the struggle.

<slide number="29" layout="framework" title="What/So What/Now What Framework">

## What/So What/Now What Framework

**A simple structure for any business communication:**

- **What:** Describe the facts, situation, or product
  > *"Our Q1 sales increased 15% to $2.3M"*

- **So What:** Explain the relevance to your audience
  > *"This puts us on track to exceed our annual target by 10%"*

- **Now What:** Outline next steps or call-to-action
  > *"Let's allocate the surplus to hire two sales reps in Q2"*

**Use this for emails, updates, presentations, meetings.**

*Source: Abrahams, M. (2024). A simple hack to help you communicate more effectively. Harvard Business Review.*

<speaker-notes>
Here's one bonus framework from Matt Abrahams at Stanford Graduate School of Business—the simplest structure you can use for quick business communication. What/So What/Now What is similar to SCQA but more action-focused and easier to remember. What equals Situation (the facts or current state), So What equals Complication plus Question combined (why it matters to your audience), Now What equals Answer (the action you want them to take). The key difference from SCQA: SCQA is better for formal, persuasive documents like proposals and memos; What/So What/Now What is better for quick updates, status reports, and spontaneous communication. Abrahams teaches this framework at Stanford for impromptu speaking—if your manager asks "How's the project?" you can instantly structure your response: What (current status), So What (impact on timeline or budget), Now What (decision needed or next milestone). Vietnamese students often give just "What" (the facts) without connecting to "So What" (audience relevance). Western business culture expects you to connect the dots for your reader—don't make them figure out why your information matters. Use whichever framework you remember more easily—SCQA or What/So What/Now What—both achieve the same goal of clear, action-oriented communication.

<slide number="30" layout="content" title="Executive Summary Best Practices">

## Executive Summary Best Practices

**The ultimate test of top-down thinking:**

1. **Lead with your recommendation** (first sentence)
2. **State the impact** (financial, strategic, operational)
3. **Provide 3 supporting arguments** (Pyramid structure)
4. **End with next steps** (clear call to action)

**Length: 1 page maximum (250-300 words)**

**Your Week 10 assessment will test this skill.**

<speaker-notes>
Executive summaries are where Pyramid Principle, SCQA, and concise editing all come together. This is your Week 10 portfolio assessment (10% of grade), so pay close attention. Rule 1: Lead with your recommendation in the very first sentence—not the third paragraph, not the second page, but sentence one. Executives read executive summaries precisely because they don't have time for the full report. Give them the answer immediately. Rule 2: State the impact in concrete terms—financial ($2M revenue increase), strategic (enter new market before competitors), or operational (reduce processing time by 40%). Rule 3: Provide your three supporting arguments using Pyramid structure—these should be MECE and logically ordered. Rule 4: End with clear next steps—what decision needs to be made, by when, and what happens after approval. Length constraint of one page (250-300 words) forces you to be ruthlessly concise—every word must earn its place. Vietnamese students often struggle with executive summaries because the format seems too direct or abrupt, but executives specifically request this format because it respects their time. Practice this skill throughout the semester, not just in Week 10. Every time you write an email or memo, ask yourself: "Could I cut this to one page without losing the essential message?" That's the executive summary mindset.

<slide number="31" layout="framework" title="How Frameworks Connect">

## How Frameworks Connect

**Your Writing Process (Week 4 Memo):**

1. **Clarify thinking:** Purpose-Person-Point
   *What am I trying to achieve?*

2. **Structure argument:** Pyramid Principle
   *Main answer + 3 supporting arguments*

3. **Craft opening:** SCQA
   *Situation-Complication-Question-Answer*

4. **Edit sentences:** Strunk & White rules
   *Omit needless words, active voice, be specific*

**Each framework serves a different stage of writing.**

<speaker-notes>
You've learned five frameworks today—here's how they fit together as an integrated process, not random disconnected tools. Stage 1 (Pre-writing): Purpose-Person-Point ensures you know what you're writing and why, preventing the "staring at blank page" problem and hours of false starts. Stage 2 (Structure): Pyramid Principle organizes your full argument logically with top-down presentation, MECE supporting arguments, typically three main points. Stage 3 (Introduction): SCQA hooks your reader in the first paragraph with context (Situation), urgency (Complication), and answer (your main recommendation). Stage 4 (Editing): Strunk and White rules tighten every sentence by cutting unnecessary words, using active voice, and replacing vague language with specifics. Together, these frameworks create a systematic process from blank page to polished document. Most students do this backward: they write sentences first (Stage 4), then try to organize them into structure (Stage 2). That's why first drafts feel painful and messy. Professional writers think first (Stage 1), structure second (Stage 2), write third (Stage 3), and edit fourth (Stage 4). The actual sentence-writing is the easiest part when you've done the thinking and structuring first.

<slide number="32" layout="content" title="Common Writing Scenarios">

## Common Writing Scenarios

**Apply these frameworks to real business situations:**

| **Scenario** | **Framework to Use** | **Key Focus** |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Cold email to potential client** | SCQA + Purpose-Person-Point | Hook them fast, show relevance |
| **Weekly status report to manager** | What/So What/Now What | Facts, impact, next steps |
| **Budget approval request** | Pyramid + SCQA | Recommendation first, justify with data |
| **Project proposal** | Pyramid + SCQA + Executive Summary | Full structure, strong opening, 1-page summary |
| **Problem escalation** | SCQA with strong Complication | Create urgency, provide solution |

**Different contexts, same structural principles.**

<speaker-notes>
Let's make these frameworks practical by mapping them to real business scenarios you'll encounter. Cold email to potential client: Use SCQA to create relevance fast—what's their current situation, what problem might they face, how can you help? Also apply Purpose-Person-Point—your purpose is to get a meeting, your person is busy and skeptical, your point is "we can solve X problem for you." Weekly status report: What/So What/Now What is perfect—what did we accomplish this week, why it matters to project goals, what's needed next. Budget approval request: Pyramid Principle with SCQA opening—lead with "We should approve $50K for X" then provide three supporting arguments (ROI, timing, risk mitigation). Project proposal: Full Pyramid structure for the body, SCQA for the introduction, and a one-page executive summary at the front so executives can decide without reading the full proposal. Problem escalation: SCQA with particularly strong Complication—create urgency by quantifying the impact and timeline, then provide a specific recommended solution. Vietnamese students often ask "Which framework should I use?" Answer: you'll usually combine multiple frameworks. SCQA and Pyramid work together in almost every business document. What/So What/Now What is the quick version when you don't have time for full structure. Purpose-Person-Point is always the starting point, regardless of format. Practice applying these frameworks to different scenarios in tutorial today—you'll develop intuition for which combination works best for each context.

<slide number="33" layout="section-break" title="Key Takeaways">

# Key Takeaways

**What to remember from today:**

1. **Think bottom-up, present top-down** — Do the analysis, give the answer first
2. **SCQA creates urgency** — Situation-Complication-Question-Answer hooks readers
3. **Omit needless words** — Every word must earn its place
4. **Be specific** — Vague language undermines credibility
5. **Clarify before you write** — Purpose-Person-Point prevents unclear drafts

**Practice these in today's tutorial and your Week 4 memo.**

<speaker-notes>
Let's recap the five most important ideas from today's lecture—these are the non-negotiables for professional business writing. Takeaway 1: this is the Pyramid Principle core—always present your conclusion first, not last, even though you thought bottom-up to reach that conclusion. Takeaway 2: never start business documents with "I am writing to..." or "This memo is about..."—use SCQA to create strategic context and urgency that respects your reader's time. Takeaway 3: all first drafts are too long; editing is what makes them powerful, and cutting 20% of your first draft is normal and expected. Takeaway 4: replace every instance of "many," "soon," "significant," "improve" with actual numbers, dates, percentages, and specific actions. Takeaway 5: spend 5 minutes answering Purpose-Person-Point before writing anything longer than a quick email—it will save you hours of revision. All five of these principles apply directly to your Week 4 Business Memo (10%), Week 7 Persuasive Proposal (15%), and Week 10 Executive Summary (10%). If you only remember one thing from today, make it: think bottom-up, present top-down. This single mental shift will transform your business writing immediately.

## Assessment Preview

**Coming Up:**

| Week | Assessment | How Today Helps |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Week 4** | Business Memo (10%) | Use Pyramid structure + SCQA opening |
| **Week 7** | Persuasive Proposal (15%) | Apply top-down argumentation + specificity |
| **Week 10** | Executive Summary (10%) | Lead with conclusions + concise editing |

**Tutorial Today:** Practice Pyramid Principle with peer feedback
**Before Next Week:** Complete Quiz 3 on Moodle (covers today's frameworks)

<speaker-notes>
Here's how today's lecture directly supports your graded assessments—this isn't abstract theory, it's practical skill-building. Week 4's Business Memo requires you to apply Pyramid Principle structure (recommendation first, three supporting arguments) and open with SCQA (create context and urgency). Grading criteria include clear organization and strategic thinking. Week 7's Persuasive Proposal builds on Week 4 by adding persuasive techniques—you'll use the same Pyramid structure but with rhetorical appeals we'll learn next week. Week 10's Executive Summary is the ultimate test of these skills: you'll distill a complex 15-page report down to a single page, leading with your recommendation. Executives won't read build-up—they need the answer in the first sentence. In today's tutorial, you'll draft a mini-business recommendation using Pyramid structure and receive peer feedback on whether your structure is clear. This low-stakes practice prepares you for the high-stakes Week 4 submission. Quiz 3 on Moodle tests your understanding of Pyramid Principle components, SCQA elements, and Strunk and White editing rules—it's due Sunday 11:59 PM. Students who master Pyramid Principle in Week 3 consistently score 10-15% higher on all three writing assessments because the structure transfers across different document types.

# Next Week Preview
## Week 4: Persuasive Written Communication

**What's coming:**
- Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion
- Ethical persuasion vs. manipulation
- Combining structure (Pyramid) with persuasion (rhetoric)

**Pre-reading:**
Cialdini, R. B. (2001). Harnessing the science of persuasion. *Harvard Business Review.*

**Why it matters:** Your Week 4 memo must be both structured AND persuasive.

<speaker-notes>
Next week we build on today's structural foundation by adding persuasive techniques—think of structure as the skeleton and persuasion as the muscles. Structure alone creates clarity; persuasion creates impact. Week 4's topic is Persuasive Written Communication, where you'll learn Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity. These are evidence-based techniques from psychology research that have been validated across cultures. The key ethical question we'll address: how do you influence without manipulating? We'll discuss the boundaries between persuasion (ethical influence with transparency) and manipulation (deceptive coercion). Connection to today: Pyramid Principle gives you clear structure; persuasion gives you strategic impact. A well-structured document that isn't persuasive won't change minds or drive action. A persuasive document without clear structure will confuse readers. You need both working together. McKinsey consultants describe it this way: "Structure gets you listened to; persuasion gets you agreed with." Your Week 4 Business Memo must demonstrate both—clear Pyramid structure plus strategic persuasion. The pre-reading—Cialdini's HBR article—is one of the most-cited business articles of all time and highly engaging. Read it before next week's lecture.

Here are resources for diving deeper into structured business writing—the HBR articles are free and highly practical. Minto's *The Pyramid Principle* is the definitive guide to structured business communication—it's expensive (around $50) but essential if you're serious about consulting or executive communication careers. Many MBA students buy it and keep it as a permanent reference. Strunk and White's *The Elements of Style* is cheap (under $10) and short enough to read in 2 hours—it's worth reading cover-to-cover before starting your Week 4 memo. Both HBR articles from 2024 are open-access with no paywall: Abrahams is a Stanford lecturer who makes frameworks memorable and easy to apply, while Danziger is a writing consultant with case studies from real professionals. Grammarly offers free education accounts that check not just grammar but also clarity, conciseness, and tone—use it on every draft before submitting. Hemingway Editor is a free web tool that highlights complex sentences, passive voice, and unnecessary adverbs. Paste your draft and it gives you a readability grade—aim for Grade 8-10 for business writing, which is professional without being academic. Many McKinsey consultants keep *The Pyramid Principle* on their desk as permanent reference. Hemingway Editor is particularly valuable for Vietnamese students because it flags overly complex English constructions that might sound formal but actually reduce clarity.

<slide number="37" layout="content" title="Questions?">

## Questions?

**Before Tutorial:**

- Clarifying questions on Pyramid Principle?
- Concerns about Week 4 memo?
- Anything unclear from today's frameworks?

**In tutorial, you'll:**
- Draft a structured business recommendation (200 words)
- Apply SCQA and Pyramid Principle
- Give and receive peer feedback on structure

**See you in 10 minutes for tutorial!**

<speaker-notes>
We've covered substantial material today—let's take 3-5 minutes for questions before breaking for tutorial. Common questions to anticipate: "How do I know if my arguments are MECE?" Answer: Ask yourself two questions—Do any arguments overlap in meaning? (if yes, they're not mutually exclusive) and Is anything important missing? (if yes, they're not collectively exhaustive). "Can I use more than 3 supporting arguments?" Answer: Yes, 2-4 arguments is acceptable, but 3 is the McKinsey standard and easiest to structure clearly. If you think you need 5-6 arguments, they probably overlap—look for ways to combine them into 3 stronger arguments. "What if I don't have specific data for Rule 3?" Answer: Acknowledge the limitation professionally—use "approximately," "we estimate," or "preliminary data suggests" to signal you know precision matters but don't have exact figures yet. "Is passive voice ever acceptable?" Answer: Yes, when the actor is unknown ("The system was compromised overnight") or irrelevant ("Votes will be counted by Friday"), but aim for 80% or more active voice in business writing. Tutorial preview: You'll receive a realistic business scenario, draft a 200-word recommendation using Pyramid structure with SCQA opening, and share with 2-3 peers for feedback on whether your structure is clear. The tutorial scenario intentionally mirrors Week 4 memo structure—today is your dress rehearsal for the graded assessment. Students who take tutorial seriously and apply peer feedback consistently score higher on the actual Week 4 submission.
