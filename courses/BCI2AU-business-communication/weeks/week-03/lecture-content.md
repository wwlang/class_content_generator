# Week 3 Lecture: Structured Business Writing

**Topic:** Structured Business Writing
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Pyramid Principle for Business Memo (Week 4), Persuasive Proposal (Week 7), Executive Summary (Week 10)

## Slide 1: The $50 Million Email
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

**A single poorly structured email cost one company $50 million in lost investment.**

The investor couldn't find the key recommendation buried on page 3. They moved on.

> "If a person's writing is unclear, it is most likely because the ordering of the ideas conflicts with the capability of the reader's mind to process them." — Barbara Minto

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- Start with energy: "Before we begin, I want to tell you about the most expensive email ever written."
- Let this statistic sink in—pause after stating the $50M figure

**Key Points:**
- This is a true story from a McKinsey consultant who witnessed an investment deal collapse
- The writer had buried their recommendation in the middle of a long analysis
- The executive couldn't find the answer quickly and assumed the proposal lacked clarity
- In business, unclear structure = wasted time = lost opportunities
- Today's lecture will ensure you never make this mistake

**Example/Story:**
- Vietnamese context: Vingroup executives reportedly spend only 2-3 minutes per proposal review
- If your key message isn't clear in the first paragraph, it won't get read
- Structure isn't about being formal—it's about respecting your reader's time

**Check Understanding:**
- "Show of hands: How many of you have received an email where you couldn't figure out what the sender wanted?"
- Most hands should go up—this validates the problem

**Transition:**
- "By the end of today, you'll know exactly how to avoid this mistake. Let's start with what you'll learn."

---

## Slide 2: Today's Learning Objectives
<!-- LAYOUT: objectives -->

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the Pyramid Principle to structure business documents top-down
2. **Construct** compelling document introductions using the SCQA framework
3. **Evaluate** business writing for clarity and concision using Strunk & White principles
4. **Design** executive summaries that lead with conclusions

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "These four objectives form the foundation of professional business writing"
- Note that all verbs are action-oriented (Apply, Construct, Evaluate, Design)

**Key Points:**
- **Objective 1:** You'll learn to think bottom-up but present top-down—a McKinsey standard
- **Objective 2:** SCQA gives you a proven formula for document openings (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)
- **Objective 3:** "Omit needless words"—every word must earn its place
- **Objective 4:** Executive summaries aren't introductions—they're standalone conclusions

**Example/Story:**
- In Vietnamese business culture, hierarchy matters: senior leaders read summaries, junior staff read details
- Your structure must serve both audiences simultaneously

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which objective seems most challenging to you? Raise your hand for each."
- Gauge class anxiety levels—most will struggle with Objective 1 (Pyramid Principle)

**Transition:**
- "Let's see how these objectives connect to your upcoming assessments."

## Slide 3: How This Prepares You
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Your Portfolio Journey:**

| Week | Assessment | What You'll Apply Today |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Week 4** | Business Memo (10%) | Pyramid structure, SCQA opening |
| **Week 7** | Persuasive Proposal (15%) | Top-down argumentation, clarity |
| **Week 10** | Executive Summary (10%) | Leading with conclusions, concision |

**Today's lecture + tutorial = 35% of your final grade**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Everything we cover today directly supports 35% of your course grade"
- Emphasize that this isn't just theory—it's practical skill-building

**Key Points:**
- **Week 4 Memo:** You'll use Pyramid Principle to structure recommendations clearly
- **Week 7 Proposal:** Top-down argumentation makes persuasion more effective
- **Week 10 Summary:** Executives need conclusions first, not build-up
- All three assessments require structured thinking before writing

**Example/Story:**
- Barbara Minto (creator of Pyramid Principle) was told at McKinsey: "We need you to teach consultants to write clearly"
- She discovered the problem wasn't writing—it was thinking
- Once you structure your thoughts logically, clear writing follows naturally

**Check Understanding:**
- "Looking at this table, which assessment are you most concerned about?"
- Validate their concerns—all three are challenging but learnable

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at today's roadmap to see how we'll build these skills step by step."

---

## Slide 4: Today's Roadmap
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Our Journey Today:**

1. **The Pyramid Principle** (25 min)
   Think bottom-up, present top-down

2. **SCQA Framework** (20 min)
   Introductions that hook readers

3. **Clarity & Concision** (20 min)
   Making every word count

4. **Application Workshop** (15 min)
   Transforming bad writing to good

5. **Wrap-up & Resources** (10 min)

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "We have 90 minutes together. Here's how we'll use that time."
- Point out that segments get progressively more applied

**Key Points:**
- Segment 1 (25 min): Core framework—longest section because it's foundational
- Segment 2 (20 min): Tactical tool for document openings
- Segment 3 (20 min): Sentence-level editing principles
- Segment 4 (15 min): We'll practice together before tutorial
- Total = 80 min, leaving 10 for Q&A and wrap-up

**Example/Story:**
- This structure follows the Pyramid Principle itself: I'm telling you the "what" (segments) before the "how" (details)
- Notice how the roadmap makes the lecture feel manageable, not overwhelming

**Check Understanding:**
- "Any questions before we dive into Segment 1?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with the framework that changed business writing forever: the Pyramid Principle."

---

## Slide 5: SEGMENT 1 — The Pyramid Principle
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**The framework used by McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and every M7 business school**

Developed by Barbara Minto at McKinsey (1963-1973)

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Segment 1 is about a single big idea: how to organize your thinking before you write"
- This framework is the McKinsey standard—it's not optional at top firms

**Key Points:**
- Barbara Minto was the first female consultant at McKinsey in 1963
- Firm partners kept asking her to fix consultants' unclear writing
- She realized the problem: people were presenting their thinking process, not their conclusions
- The Pyramid Principle flips traditional writing on its head

**Example/Story:**
- Traditional writing: "I did A, then B, then C, and therefore recommend D"
- Pyramid writing: "I recommend D because of A, B, and C"
- The reader gets the answer first, then can choose how deep to go

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about your high school essays—did you build to a conclusion or start with one?"
- Most will say "build to conclusion"—that's what we're unlearning today

**Transition:**
- "Let's see what the pyramid actually looks like."

---

## Slide 6: The Pyramid Structure
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

```
                    MAIN ANSWER
                   /     |      \
              Arg 1   Arg 2    Arg 3
             /  |  \  /  |  \  /  |  \
          Data  Data  Data  Data  Data
```

**Three Rules:**
1. Ideas above must summarize those below
2. Grouped ideas must be logically the same kind
3. Ideas must follow logical order

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "This is the Pyramid Principle visually—simple structure, profound impact"
- Draw attention to the top-down flow

**Key Points:**
- **Top level (Main Answer):** Your governing thought—the single recommendation or conclusion
- **Second level (3 Arguments):** Supporting reasons grouped logically (usually 3, sometimes 2-4)
- **Third level (Data):** Facts, evidence, examples that prove each argument
- **Rule 1:** Each level summarizes the one below (executive can stop reading at any level)
- **Rule 2:** Don't mix argument types (financial + operational + strategic, not random mix)
- **Rule 3:** Order matters—chronological, structural, comparative, or deductive

**Example/Story:**
- Vietnamese example: "We should open a Hanoi office" (Answer)
  - Arg 1: Market demand is growing 25% annually
  - Arg 2: Competitors are entering the market now
  - Arg 3: We have qualified local staff ready
- Each argument answers "why should we?" and sits at the same logical level

**Check Understanding:**
- "If I asked you to recommend a restaurant to a friend, what would be your 'main answer'?"
- Listen for structure: good answers start with restaurant name, weak answers give long backstory

**Transition:**
- "Now let's see how you think bottom-up but present top-down."

---

## Slide 7: Think Bottom-Up, Present Top-Down
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

| **How You Think (Analysis)** | **How You Present (Document)** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1. Gather data | 1. State recommendation |
| 2. Identify patterns | 2. Provide 3 supporting arguments |
| 3. Form arguments | 3. Share key data as needed |
| 4. Reach conclusion | 4. Offer next steps |

**The magic: You do the hard thinking so your reader doesn't have to.**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "This is the most important slide in today's lecture"
- The Pyramid Principle doesn't change how you think—it changes how you communicate

**Key Points:**
- **Left column (Analysis):** This is inductive reasoning—you collect evidence and build to a conclusion
- **Right column (Document):** This is deductive presentation—you lead with the conclusion
- Your reader trusts you've done the analysis; they just want the answer
- Bottom-up thinking is essential for good analysis; top-down presentation is essential for clear communication
- Most people write documents that mirror their thinking process—this exhausts readers

**Example/Story:**
- Imagine asking a colleague "Should we approve this vendor?"
- Bad answer: "Well, I looked at 15 vendors, compared pricing models, called references..."
- Good answer: "Yes, approve them. They're 20% cheaper, have better reviews, and can start Monday."
- The good answer respects your time by answering first, then providing support

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick poll: When you write reports now, do you tend to build to a conclusion or lead with it?"
- Most will admit they build—this is the habit we're breaking

**Transition:**
- "Let's see a real-world example of pyramid structure in action."

## Slide 8: Case Study — McKinsey Recommendation
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Client Question:** Should we enter the Vietnamese electric vehicle market?

**Pyramid Structure:**

**Recommendation (Top):**
Yes, enter now with a $50M investment targeting premium urban buyers.

**Supporting Arguments (Level 2):**
1. **Market timing:** EV adoption growing 40% YoY in Hanoi/HCMC
2. **Competitive position:** Only 2 established players, gap in premium segment
3. **Financial return:** Projected 3-year breakeven with 25% margin

**Data (Level 3):** Market research, competitor analysis, financial models

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Let's see how McKinsey would structure a real recommendation about the Vietnamese market"
- Note: This is a realistic scenario, not an actual McKinsey client

**Key Points:**
- **Main Answer:** Clear, specific, actionable (not "maybe" or "it depends")
- **Three Arguments:** Each answers "why enter?" from different angle (market, competition, finance)
- **Notice the MECE principle:** Mutually Exclusive (no overlap), Collectively Exhaustive (covers everything relevant)
- Argument 1 = market pull, Argument 2 = competitive gap, Argument 3 = financial viability
- An executive could read just the recommendation and make a decision
- They can drill into arguments if they need more confidence

**Example/Story:**
- In Vietnamese business culture, this structure respects hierarchy
- Senior leaders get the answer immediately (recommendation)
- Middle managers get strategic rationale (three arguments)
- Analysts get detailed evidence (data layer)
- Everyone gets what they need at their level

**Check Understanding:**
- "If the client asked 'Why enter now?' which argument would you emphasize?"
- Listen for understanding: should point to Argument 1 (market timing)

**Transition:**
- "Now let's talk about a common mistake: violating the MECE principle."

---

## Slide 9: The MECE Principle
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**MECE = Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

**Mutually Exclusive:** No overlap between ideas
**Collectively Exhaustive:** Nothing relevant is missing

**Bad Example (Violates MECE):**
1. Increase revenue
2. Expand into new markets ← *Overlaps with #1*
3. Improve customer retention

**Good Example (MECE):**
1. Acquire new customers
2. Increase revenue per customer
3. Improve customer retention

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "MECE is the logic check for your pyramid structure"
- Pronunciation: "MEE-see" (rhymes with "easy")

**Key Points:**
- **Mutually Exclusive:** Each argument should be distinct with no overlap
- **Collectively Exhaustive:** Together, arguments should cover all relevant ground
- **Bad example problem:** "Expand into new markets" is a way to "increase revenue"—these overlap
- **Good example fix:** All three ways to grow revenue are distinct (acquire, upsell, retain)
- MECE ensures your logic is tight and complete
- This principle comes from consulting but applies to any structured argument

**Example/Story:**
- Think of MECE like organizing a closet: every item has one clear place (mutually exclusive), and there's a place for every item (collectively exhaustive)
- Vietnamese students often ask "How many arguments do I need?" Answer: However many it takes to be exhaustive
- Usually 3, sometimes 2 or 4, rarely more than 5

**Check Understanding:**
- "Here's a test: If I recommend 'Improve employee satisfaction,' would these 3 arguments be MECE?"
  1. Increase salaries
  2. Offer remote work
  3. Improve benefits
- Answer: Yes—each is distinct (ME) and together they cover major satisfaction drivers (CE)

**Transition:**
- "MECE keeps your logic clean. Now let's talk about how to introduce your pyramid structure."

---

## Slide 10: SEGMENT 2 — SCQA Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**How to write document introductions that hook your reader**

Situation → Complication → Question → Answer

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "We've covered how to structure your full document with the Pyramid Principle"
- "Now let's zoom in on the opening—the most critical 3-4 sentences"

**Key Points:**
- SCQA is part of Minto's Pyramid Principle—it's the introduction structure
- Every business document needs a strong opening that creates context and urgency
- SCQA gives you a proven formula: Situation, Complication, Question, Answer
- This framework works for emails, memos, reports, proposals, presentations
- It typically takes 1 paragraph (4-6 sentences)

**Example/Story:**
- Think of SCQA like a movie trailer: Set the scene (S), create tension (C), pose the question (Q), hint at resolution (A)
- The goal is to make the reader care before you give them your full argument

**Check Understanding:**
- "Before we break down SCQA, has anyone noticed this pattern in professional emails?"
- Some may recognize it unconsciously—validate that they've seen good structure before

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down each component of SCQA."

---

## Slide 11: SCQA Breakdown
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**S — Situation:** Indisputable context the audience already accepts
*"Our customer retention rate has held steady at 85% for 3 years."*

**C — Complication:** The problem or change creating urgency
*"However, our top competitor just launched a loyalty program, and we're seeing early signs of churn in the premium segment."*

**Q — Question:** What naturally arises from the complication
*"How should we respond to protect our customer base?"*

**A — Answer:** Your recommendation (the pyramid top)
*"We should launch a premium tier loyalty program by Q2, focusing on our top 20% of customers."*

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Let's walk through SCQA with a customer retention example"
- Read each component aloud and pause to let students absorb

**Key Points:**
- **Situation:** Must be something the audience already agrees with—no debate here
  - "85% retention for 3 years" is factual, neutral
- **Complication:** Creates tension and urgency—this is what changed
  - "Competitor loyalty program" introduces a threat
  - Note "early signs of churn"—specificity makes it real
- **Question:** Should arise naturally from the complication
  - Reader should be thinking this question before you state it
  - If they're not, your complication wasn't strong enough
- **Answer:** This is your governing thought—the top of your pyramid
  - Notice it's specific: "premium tier," "by Q2," "top 20%"
  - After SCQA, you'd provide 3 supporting arguments (next slide of document)

**Example/Story:**
- Vietnamese business context: Many students start documents with "I am writing to..."
- SCQA replaces that weak opening with strategic context
- Compare: "I am writing to recommend a loyalty program" (weak) vs. full SCQA above (strong)

**Check Understanding:**
- "If I removed the Complication, would you care about the Answer?"
- Answer: No—without urgency, recommendations feel unnecessary

**Transition:**
- "Let's see SCQA in a full document opening."

---

## Slide 12: SCQA in Action — Full Email Opening
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**To:** Regional Director
**Subject:** Premium Loyalty Program Recommendation

**Email Opening:**

Our customer retention rate has held steady at 85% for three years, contributing to predictable revenue growth. **[S]** However, our top competitor launched a points-based loyalty program last month, and we're seeing early churn signals among premium customers—15% increase in support tickets asking about loyalty benefits. **[C]** How should we respond to protect our most valuable customer segment? **[Q]**

We should launch a premium-tier loyalty program by Q2, focusing on the top 20% of customers who generate 60% of our revenue. **[A]** This approach will require $200K investment but is projected to reduce churn by 5 percentage points, protecting $2M in annual revenue.

**The next paragraph would give 3 supporting arguments...**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Here's SCQA in a real business email—the kind you'll write in Week 4"
- Point out the bracketed letters [S], [C], [Q], [A] to help students see structure

**Key Points:**
- **Situation (sentence 1):** Establishes baseline—"85% retention, predictable growth"
- **Complication (sentence 2):** Two-part problem—competitor move + data signal (15% ticket increase)
  - Notice specificity: "last month," "15% increase"—details make it credible
- **Question (sentence 3):** One clear question that any reader would be thinking
- **Answer (sentences 4-5):** Specific recommendation with key details (Q2, top 20%, $200K, $2M)
  - Second sentence adds financial justification—smart to include here
- **After this opening:** Writer would provide 3 arguments (implementation plan, customer segments, ROI analysis)

**Example/Story:**
- Compare this to how most students write: "I am writing to propose a loyalty program. Loyalty programs are important because..."
- SCQA eliminates filler and gets straight to strategic context
- This email respects the Regional Director's time—they get full context in 10 seconds

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you were the Regional Director, would you keep reading after this opening?"
- Answer should be yes—clear problem, clear solution, clear business case

**Transition:**
- "SCQA works for any business document. Now let's see it in different contexts."

---

## Slide 13: SCQA Variations by Context
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

| **Context** | **Situation** | **Complication** |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Proposal** | Current state | Gap or opportunity |
| **Status Update** | Project milestone | Blocker or risk |
| **Recommendation** | Industry trend | Competitive threat |
| **Request** | Team capacity | Resource constraint |

**The pattern stays the same; the content changes.**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "SCQA is a flexible framework—it adapts to any business writing scenario"
- Walk through each row to show versatility

**Key Points:**
- **Proposal:** S = "We currently use Excel for inventory," C = "but we're losing $50K/year to errors"
- **Status Update:** S = "Project 80% complete," C = "but vendor delayed shipment 2 weeks"
- **Recommendation:** S = "Industry moving to cloud," C = "our on-premise servers put us at risk"
- **Request:** S = "Team is at 90% capacity," C = "new client project would push us to 120%"
- In every case, S establishes baseline, C creates urgency
- The Q and A naturally follow from understanding the complication

**Example/Story:**
- Vietnamese students often struggle with directness—SCQA feels blunt
- Remind them: In professional settings, clarity = respect for reader's time
- Senior Vietnamese business leaders (especially multinational context) expect this directness

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which context applies to your Week 4 memo assignment?"
- Answer: Recommendation (you'll identify a business problem and recommend a solution)

**Transition:**
- "SCQA gives you the introduction. Now let's make sure every sentence inside is clear and concise."

---

## Slide 14: SEGMENT 3 — Clarity & Concision
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Making every word count**

Based on *The Elements of Style* by Strunk & White
(#1 most-assigned text in US higher education)

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "We've covered structure (Pyramid) and introduction (SCQA). Now let's talk about sentences."
- This segment is about editing—the final polish

**Key Points:**
- *The Elements of Style* was written in 1918 by William Strunk Jr. at Cornell
- Updated by E.B. White (author of *Charlotte's Web*) in 1959
- Over 10 million copies sold—it's the bible of clear writing
- The book has 100+ rules, but today we'll focus on the 3 most important for business writing

**Example/Story:**
- Stephen King: "Any word you can cut should be cut."
- Vietnamese students often write long sentences thinking it sounds more professional
- In English business writing, short and direct = professional
- Long and complex = unclear (even if grammatically correct)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick poll: Do you tend to write long sentences or short sentences?"
- Most will say long—this segment will help them edit

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with the most famous rule in the book."

---

## Slide 15: Rule 1 — Omit Needless Words
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts."
> — William Strunk Jr.

**Translation: Make every word earn its place.**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "This is the #1 rule from *The Elements of Style*—and the hardest to master"
- Read the quote aloud slowly for impact

**Key Points:**
- "Omit needless words" doesn't mean "make all sentences short"
- It means eliminate words that add no meaning
- Think of writing like engineering: every part must serve a function
- Concise ≠ simplistic; concise = precise
- Most first drafts have 20-30% unnecessary words

**Example/Story:**
- Strunk's metaphor: A drawing with unnecessary lines looks cluttered and unclear
- Same with writing—extra words obscure your message
- Vietnamese students often add phrases like "I would like to say that" or "It is important to note that"
- These phrases add zero meaning—they're filler

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can anyone spot a needless phrase you use in writing?"
- Common answers: "In order to" (use "to"), "Due to the fact that" (use "because")

**Transition:**
- "Let's see this rule in action with before/after examples."

---

## Slide 16: Omit Needless Words — Examples
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

| **Before (Wordy)** | **After (Concise)** | **Words Saved** |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| In order to improve performance | To improve performance | 2 words |
| Due to the fact that | Because | 4 words |
| At this point in time | Now | 3 words |
| In the event that | If | 3 words |
| It is important to note that | [Delete entirely] | 6 words |

**In a 500-word memo, eliminating these saves 50+ words (10% shorter).**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Here are the most common offenders in business writing"
- These phrases appear in almost every first draft—including from professionals

**Key Points:**
- **"In order to"** → always just "to" (meaning never changes)
- **"Due to the fact that"** → always "because" (4 words become 1)
- **"At this point in time"** → pompous way to say "now"
- **"In the event that"** → just "if"
- **"It is important to note that"** → the reader will decide what's important; just state it directly
- These phrases feel formal, so students think they sound professional
- Actually they signal unclear thinking—professionals cut them ruthlessly

**Example/Story:**
- McKinsey has an internal editing rule: "If you can cut a word, cut it"
- Partners will literally cross out phrases like these in consultant drafts
- Students often ask "Won't my writing sound too simple?" Answer: No, it will sound confident

**Check Understanding:**
- "Look at your last assignment. How many of these phrases did you use?"
- (This is rhetorical—planting awareness for future writing)

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at the second key rule: active voice."

---

## Slide 17: Rule 2 — Use Active Voice
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Passive Voice (Weak):**
"The report was completed by the team."
*Subject receives action*

**Active Voice (Strong):**
"The team completed the report."
*Subject performs action*

**Why active voice?**
- Clearer responsibility
- Shorter sentences
- More confident tone

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Active vs. passive voice is the difference between confident and weak writing"
- Most business writing should be active (80%+ of sentences)

**Key Points:**
- **Passive voice pattern:** [Thing] was [verbed] by [doer]
  - Example: "The decision was made by management"
- **Active voice pattern:** [Doer] [verbed] [thing]
  - Example: "Management made the decision"
- **When to use passive:** When the actor is unknown or irrelevant
  - OK: "The server was hacked" (hacker identity unknown)
  - Bad: "The meeting was scheduled by Sarah" (why hide Sarah's action?)
- **Business benefit:** Active voice clarifies who is responsible
  - "We recommend" vs. "It is recommended" — former shows ownership

**Example/Story:**
- Passive voice is often used to avoid blame: "Mistakes were made" (by whom?)
- Vietnamese students sometimes use passive to sound polite or formal
- In English business writing, active voice = directness = respect
- Passive voice can signal evasion or weak leadership

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which sounds more confident: 'The proposal will be submitted by Friday' or 'We will submit the proposal by Friday'?"
- Answer: Second (active)—shows ownership

**Transition:**
- "One more rule: be specific."

---

## Slide 18: Rule 3 — Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

| **Vague** | **Specific** |
|-----------|--------------|
| Sales increased significantly | Sales increased 23% quarter-over-quarter |
| Many customers complained | 47 customers filed complaints (15% of total base) |
| We need to improve soon | We need to implement changes by March 15 |
| The project is going well | The project is 85% complete, on budget, 3 days ahead of schedule |

**Specificity builds credibility.**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "This rule separates professional business writing from student writing"
- Vague language makes you sound uncertain; specific language builds trust

**Key Points:**
- **"Significantly," "many," "soon," "well"** — all vague qualifiers
- Readers immediately ask: "How much? How many? When? By what measure?"
- If you have the specific data, use it
- If you don't have data, get it before writing
- **Exception:** When precise data isn't available, acknowledge it: "Approximately 50 customers" or "We estimate..."

**Example/Story:**
- Compare two consultants:
  - Consultant A: "Revenue will improve if we implement this strategy"
  - Consultant B: "Revenue will increase by $2M annually if we implement this strategy by Q2"
- Who sounds more credible? Consultant B—specificity = expertise
- Vietnamese students sometimes avoid specifics for fear of being wrong
- Better to be specific and adjust later than to be vague and ignored

**Check Understanding:**
- "If I said 'This course has helped many students,' what question would you ask?"
- Answer: "How many?" — proving that vague claims trigger skepticism

**Transition:**
- "Now let's put all three rules together in a real editing exercise."

---

## Slide 19: Editing Exercise — Before Version
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Memo Draft (First Version):**

*"In order to improve customer satisfaction, it is recommended that a new feedback system should be implemented. Due to the fact that many customers have expressed concerns about response times, it is important that we address this issue soon. The new system will allow customers to rate their experience, and improvements will be made based on the feedback that is received."*

**Word count:** 65 words
**Problems:** Passive voice, needless words, vague language

**What would you cut or change?**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Let's apply all three rules to this memo draft"
- Give students 30 seconds to silently identify problems

**Key Points:**
- **Needless words:** "In order to" (→ "To"), "Due to the fact that" (→ "Because"), "It is important that" (delete)
- **Passive voice:** "It is recommended that... should be implemented" (→ "We recommend implementing"), "improvements will be made" (→ "we will make improvements")
- **Vague language:** "many customers" (how many?), "soon" (when?), "improvements" (what kind?)
- **Overall tone:** Weak and bureaucratic—sounds like writer is hiding

**Example/Story:**
- This is how most first drafts look—including from professionals
- The difference: professionals edit ruthlessly before sending
- Students often submit first drafts
- Editing is where good writing happens

**Check Understanding:**
- "Show of hands: Does this sound like your writing?"
- Validate if many hands go up—"You're not alone, and we're about to fix it"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see the edited version."

## Slide 20: Editing Exercise — After Version
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Memo Draft (Edited Version):**

*"To improve customer satisfaction, we recommend implementing a new feedback system by March 31. Over 120 customers (38% of respondents) reported slow response times in our Q4 survey. The new system will allow customers to rate their experience on a 5-point scale, and we will address issues scoring below 3.0 within 48 hours."*

**Word count:** 54 words (17% shorter)
**Improvements:** Active voice, specific data, clear deadlines

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Here's the same message, edited with all three rules applied"
- Read both versions aloud to hear the difference

**Key Points:**
- **Omit needless words:** Cut 11 words (65 → 54)
  - "In order to" → "To"
  - "Due to the fact that" → deleted (merged into next sentence)
  - "It is recommended that... should be" → "We recommend"
- **Active voice:** "We recommend" (not "it is recommended"), "we will address" (not "will be addressed")
- **Specific language:**
  - "many customers" → "120 customers (38% of respondents)"
  - "soon" → "by March 31"
  - "improvements" → "address issues scoring below 3.0 within 48 hours"
- **Result:** Shorter, clearer, more confident, more credible

**Example/Story:**
- Notice the edited version doesn't lose any meaning
- In fact, it adds specificity while being shorter
- This is the goal: say more with less
- The writer now sounds like a decision-maker, not a report-writer

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which version would you trust more as a manager?"
- Answer: After version—specificity signals competence

**Transition:**
- "Let's see one more framework before we wrap up: the Purpose-Person-Point model."

---

## Slide 21: Purpose-Person-Point Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Before you write anything, answer 3 questions:**

1. **Purpose:** What result do I want?
   *(Inform? Request? Persuade?)*

2. **Person:** Who is my reader?
   *(What do they need to understand my message?)*

3. **Point:** What's my essential message?
   *(What must they know or do?)*

**Clear thinking → Clear writing**

*Source: Danziger, E. (2024). How to take your business writing from "average" to "great." Harvard Business Review.*

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "This framework comes from a 2024 HBR article by Elizabeth Danziger"
- It's the pre-writing step that prevents unclear drafts

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** Most unclear writing comes from unclear intent
  - Are you informing (sharing facts), requesting (asking for something), or persuading (changing minds)?
  - If you don't know, your reader won't either
- **Person:** Audience analysis before structure
  - What does your reader already know? What do they need to know?
  - A technical audience needs different details than an executive audience
- **Point:** Can you state your message in one sentence?
  - If not, you're not ready to write yet
  - This becomes your SCQA Answer or Pyramid top

**Example/Story:**
- Case from article: Erica, a staff engineer, struggled to write a follow-up email
- She couldn't draft it because she didn't know if her purpose was to confirm receipt, request a signature, or highlight her firm's capabilities
- Once she clarified Purpose (request signature), the email wrote itself
- Many students spend hours on bad drafts when 5 minutes of pre-writing clarity would save time

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about your last email. Could you clearly state Purpose, Person, Point?"
- Most will realize they dove into writing without this clarity

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect all the frameworks we've covered today."

---

## Slide 22: How Frameworks Connect
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Your Writing Process (Week 4 Memo):**

1. **Clarify thinking:** Purpose-Person-Point (What am I trying to achieve?)
2. **Structure argument:** Pyramid Principle (Main answer + 3 supporting arguments)
3. **Craft opening:** SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)
4. **Edit sentences:** Strunk & White rules (Omit needless words, active voice, be specific)

**Each framework serves a different stage of writing.**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "You've learned 4 frameworks today. Here's how they fit together."
- Emphasize that this is a process, not random tools

**Key Points:**
- **Stage 1 (Thinking):** Purpose-Person-Point ensures you know what you're writing and why
  - Prevents the "staring at blank page" problem
- **Stage 2 (Structure):** Pyramid Principle organizes your full argument logically
  - Top-down, MECE, 3 supporting arguments
- **Stage 3 (Introduction):** SCQA hooks your reader in the first paragraph
  - Context + urgency + answer
- **Stage 4 (Editing):** Strunk & White rules tighten every sentence
  - Cut words, use active voice, be specific
- **Together:** These frameworks take you from idea to polished document

**Example/Story:**
- Most students reverse this: they write first (sentences), then try to organize (structure)
- That's why first drafts feel painful and unclear
- Professional writers think first, structure second, write third, edit fourth
- The writing itself is the easiest part when you've done the thinking

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which stage do you usually skip?"
- Common answer: Stage 1 (thinking) or Stage 4 (editing)

**Transition:**
- "Let's talk about Matt Abrahams' framework as a bonus tool."

---

## Slide 23: Bonus Framework — What/So What/Now What
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**A simple structure for any business communication:**

- **What:** Describe the facts, situation, or product
  *"Our Q1 sales increased 15% to $2.3M"*

- **So What:** Explain the relevance to your audience
  *"This puts us on track to exceed our annual target by 10%"*

- **Now What:** Outline next steps or call-to-action
  *"Let's allocate the surplus to hire two sales reps in Q2"*

**Use this for emails, updates, presentations, meetings.**

*Source: Abrahams, M. (2024). A simple hack to help you communicate more effectively. Harvard Business Review.*

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Here's one more framework from Matt Abrahams at Stanford GSB"
- This is the simplest structure—great for quick emails and updates

**Key Points:**
- **What/So What/Now What** is similar to SCQA but more action-focused
- **What = Situation** (the facts)
- **So What = Complication + Question** (why it matters)
- **Now What = Answer** (what to do next)
- Difference from SCQA: SCQA is better for persuasive documents, What/So What/Now What is better for updates and requests
- Both work; choose based on context

**Example/Story:**
- Abrahams teaches this at Stanford for spontaneous communication
- If someone asks "How's the project?" you can structure your answer: What (status), So What (impact), Now What (next steps)
- Vietnamese students often give just "What" (facts) without "So What" (relevance)
- Western business culture expects you to connect the dots for your audience

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which is easier to remember: SCQA or What/So What/Now What?"
- Either answer is fine—use whichever framework sticks

**Transition:**
- "Let's wrap up with key takeaways."

---

## Slide 24: Key Takeaways
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**What to remember from today:**

1. **Think bottom-up, present top-down** — Do the analysis, give the answer first
2. **SCQA creates urgency** — Situation-Complication-Question-Answer hooks readers
3. **Omit needless words** — Every word must earn its place
4. **Be specific** — Vague language undermines credibility
5. **Clarify before you write** — Purpose-Person-Point prevents unclear drafts

**Practice these in today's tutorial and your Week 4 memo.**

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Let's recap the 5 most important ideas from today's lecture"
- These are the non-negotiables for professional business writing

**Key Points:**
- **Takeaway 1:** This is the Pyramid Principle core—present conclusions first, not last
- **Takeaway 2:** Don't start with "I am writing to..."—use SCQA to create context and urgency
- **Takeaway 3:** First drafts are always too long; editing makes them stronger
- **Takeaway 4:** Replace "many," "soon," "significant" with numbers and dates
- **Takeaway 5:** Spend 5 minutes on Purpose-Person-Point before writing anything
- All 5 apply to your Week 4 memo, Week 7 proposal, and Week 10 executive summary

**Example/Story:**
- If you only remember one thing: Think bottom-up, present top-down
- This single shift will transform your business writing immediately
- Everything else (SCQA, editing rules) supports this core principle

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which takeaway feels most challenging?"
- Acknowledge difficulty—these are advanced skills

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at your upcoming assessments."

---

## Slide 25: Assessment Preview
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Coming Up:**

| Week | Assessment | How Today Helps |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Week 4** | Business Memo (10%) | Use Pyramid structure + SCQA opening |
| **Week 7** | Persuasive Proposal (15%) | Apply top-down argumentation + specificity |
| **Week 10** | Executive Summary (10%) | Lead with conclusions + concise editing |

**Tutorial Today:** Practice Pyramid Principle with peer feedback
**Before Next Week:** Complete Quiz 3 on Moodle (covers today's frameworks)

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Here's how today's learning directly supports your graded work"
- Emphasize that this isn't abstract theory—it's skill-building for assessments

**Key Points:**
- **Week 4 Memo (due soon):** You'll structure a business recommendation using Pyramid Principle and open with SCQA
  - Scenario will be provided in tutorial
  - Success = clear top-down structure + specific language
- **Week 7 Proposal:** Builds on Week 4 by adding persuasive techniques
  - Same structural principles (Pyramid, SCQA) but with rhetorical appeals
- **Week 10 Executive Summary:** Most challenging—must distill complex report to 1-page summary
  - Leading with conclusions is essential (executives won't read build-up)
- **Today's tutorial:** You'll draft a mini-memo using Pyramid Principle
  - Peer feedback will help you see what works
- **Quiz 3:** Covers Pyramid Principle, SCQA, Strunk & White rules
  - Due Sunday 11:59 PM on Moodle

**Example/Story:**
- Students who master Pyramid Principle in Week 3 consistently score higher on all three writing assessments
- The structure transfers across document types
- Think of today as foundational—you'll build on this for 8 weeks

**Check Understanding:**
- "Any questions about the upcoming assessments?"
- Address concerns now before tutorial

**Transition:**
- "Let's preview next week and then share resources."

---

## Slide 26: Next Week Preview
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Week 4: Persuasive Written Communication**

**What's coming:**
- Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion
- Ethical persuasion vs. manipulation
- Combining structure (Pyramid) with persuasion (rhetoric)

**Pre-reading:**
Cialdini, R. B. (2001). Harnessing the science of persuasion. *Harvard Business Review.*

**Why it matters:** Your Week 4 memo must be both structured AND persuasive.

**Speaker Notes:**

**Opening:**
- "Next week we build on today's structure with persuasive techniques"
- Think of it as adding fuel to the engine—structure is the engine, persuasion is the fuel

**Key Points:**
- **Week 4 topic:** Persuasive writing (not just clear writing)
- **Cialdini's 6 Principles:** Reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity
  - These are evidence-based persuasion techniques from psychology research
- **Key question:** How do you influence without manipulating?
  - We'll discuss ethical boundaries of persuasion
- **Connection to today:** Pyramid Principle gives you structure; persuasion gives you impact
  - A well-structured document that isn't persuasive won't change minds
  - A persuasive document without structure won't be clear
  - You need both

**Example/Story:**
- McKinsey consultants say: "Structure gets you listened to; persuasion gets you agreed with"
- Your Week 4 memo needs both: Pyramid structure + persuasive evidence
- The pre-reading (Cialdini HBR article) is one of the most-cited business articles ever
  - Read it before class—it's highly engaging

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick poll: Have you heard of Cialdini or his persuasion principles before?"
- Gauge prior knowledge—many may know from psychology or marketing classes

**Transition:**
- "Finally, let's share resources for further learning."
