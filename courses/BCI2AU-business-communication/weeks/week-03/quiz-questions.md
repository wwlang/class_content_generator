    topic: "Pyramid Principle"

    question: |
      What are the three levels of the Pyramid Principle structure?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Main answer at top; supporting arguments in middle; data and evidence at bottom"
        feedback: "Correct! The Pyramid Principle has three hierarchical levels: governing thought (top), supporting arguments (middle), and supporting data (bottom)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Introduction at top; body in middle; conclusion at bottom"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes traditional essay structure, not the Pyramid Principle, which places conclusions first."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Data at top; analysis in middle; recommendations at bottom"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is bottom-up presentation. The Pyramid Principle reverses this—recommendations go at the top."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Problem at top; options in middle; solution at bottom"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Pyramid Principle leads with the solution (answer), not the problem."

    general_feedback: |
      The Pyramid Principle structure has three levels: (1) Main answer or recommendation at the top, (2) Supporting arguments (typically 3) in the middle, and (3) Data, facts, and evidence at the bottom. This structure allows executives to stop reading at any level depending on how much detail they need. See Week 3 slides 7-9.

    topic: "Pyramid Principle"

    question: |
      How does the Pyramid Principle differ from traditional bottom-up writing?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Pyramid presents conclusions first; traditional builds to conclusions last"
        feedback: "Correct! Pyramid Principle = top-down presentation (answer first). Traditional = bottom-up presentation (answer last after analysis)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Pyramid uses more data; traditional uses less evidence"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both approaches can use the same amount of data—the difference is where you place the conclusion, not how much evidence you provide."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Pyramid is for emails only; traditional is for reports only"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Pyramid Principle applies to all business documents (emails, memos, reports, proposals), not just emails."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Pyramid requires exactly three arguments; traditional can use any number"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Pyramid Principle typically uses 3 arguments but can use 2-4. The key difference is top-down versus bottom-up presentation."

    general_feedback: |
      The fundamental difference is presentation order: Pyramid Principle presents the conclusion first (top-down, <b>deductive</b> presentation meaning starting with the answer), while traditional writing builds to the conclusion last (bottom-up, <b>inductive</b> presentation meaning building evidence to reach a conclusion). Both may use the same analytical process—the difference is how you communicate results. Pyramid respects the reader's time by giving the answer immediately. See Week 3 slide 8.

    topic: "Pyramid Principle"

    question: |
      What does MECE stand for, and what is its purpose in the Pyramid Principle?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive—ensures arguments don't overlap and cover everything relevant"
        feedback: "Correct! MECE is the logic test for pyramid structure. Mutually Exclusive = no overlap. Collectively Exhaustive = nothing relevant missing."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Minimal Effort, Complete Execution—ensures efficiency in writing"
        feedback: "Incorrect. MECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive, and relates to logical organization, not efficiency."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Maximum Evidence, Clear Examples—ensures strong supporting data"
        feedback: "Incorrect. MECE is about logical organization of arguments (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), not about the quantity or quality of evidence."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Main Executive Communication Elements—ensures executive readability"
        feedback: "Incorrect. MECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. It's a logic framework, not an executive communication checklist."

    general_feedback: |
      MECE (pronounced "MEE-see") means Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. <b>Mutually Exclusive</b> (separate, non-overlapping) ensures your supporting arguments don't overlap in meaning. <b>Collectively Exhaustive</b> (complete, comprehensive) ensures your arguments together cover everything relevant to your main point. MECE is the quality check for your pyramid structure. Example: "Acquire new customers, increase revenue per customer, improve retention" is MECE because these three growth strategies don't overlap and together cover all major revenue growth levers. See Week 3 slide 10.

    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "SCQA Framework"

    question: |
      What do the letters S, C, Q, and A stand for in the SCQA framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Situation, Complication, Question, Answer"
        feedback: "Correct! SCQA provides a four-part structure for introducing any business document: Situation → Complication → Question → Answer."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Summary, Context, Query, Action"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The SCQA framework stands for Situation, Complication, Question, Answer—not Summary, Context, Query, Action."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Subject, Concern, Quotation, Analysis"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SCQA stands for Situation, Complication, Question, Answer. It's an introduction framework, not a literary analysis tool."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Strategy, Challenge, Quantification, Approval"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SCQA stands for Situation, Complication, Question, Answer. It's a document introduction structure from Minto's Pyramid Principle."

    general_feedback: |
      SCQA stands for <b>Situation</b> (indisputable context the audience accepts), <b>Complication</b> (the problem or change creating urgency), <b>Question</b> (what naturally arises from the complication), and <b>Answer</b> (your recommendation—the top of your pyramid). This framework helps you write introductions that hook readers by creating context and urgency before presenting your solution. SCQA typically takes one paragraph (4-6 sentences) and works for emails, memos, reports, and proposals. See Week 3 slides 11-13.

  - id: "W3-Q5-scqa-complication"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SCQA Framework"

    question: |
      What is the purpose of the Complication element in the SCQA framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "To create urgency by presenting a problem or change that demands a response"
        feedback: "Correct! The Complication introduces tension and urgency—it's what changed or what's wrong, making your reader care about finding a solution."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "To provide background context that the audience already accepts"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the Situation (S), not the Complication (C). Complication creates urgency by presenting a problem."

      - key: "C"
        text: "To state your main recommendation or solution clearly"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the Answer (A), not the Complication (C). Complication presents the problem that your Answer will solve."

      - key: "D"
        text: "To ask what the reader should do next"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the Question (Q), not the Complication (C). Complication presents the problem or change that makes the Question necessary."

    general_feedback: |
      The Complication creates tension and urgency by presenting a problem, change, or threat that demands action. While the Situation is neutral and factual (context everyone accepts), the Complication introduces disruption—something changed, something is wrong, or an opportunity will be lost if action isn't taken. Good Complications are specific and immediate (not vague or theoretical), making the reader naturally wonder "What should we do?" which leads to the Question. See Week 3 slide 12.

  - id: "W3-Q6-scqa-situation"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SCQA Framework"

    question: |
      How do Situation and Complication differ in the SCQA framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Situation presents neutral context the audience accepts; Complication introduces a problem creating urgency"
        feedback: "Correct! Situation is factual baseline (what everyone agrees on). Complication is the disruption (what changed or what's wrong)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Situation is the problem; Complication is the solution"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Situation is neutral context, Complication is the problem, and Answer is the solution. Situation and Complication are both part of setup."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Situation is what you want to happen; Complication is what actually happened"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Situation is factual context everyone accepts. Complication introduces the problem or change. Neither is about wants versus reality."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Situation requires evidence; Complication does not"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both Situation and Complication can include evidence. The difference is that Situation is neutral baseline while Complication creates urgency."

    general_feedback: |
      Situation and Complication serve different roles in creating engagement. <b>Situation</b> (background, context) is indisputable context the audience already accepts—it's neutral and factual, establishing baseline understanding. <b>Complication</b> (problem, disruption) introduces the problem, change, or threat that creates urgency and makes action necessary. Together, they set up the Question. Example: Situation = "Our retention is 85% for 3 years" (neutral fact). Complication = "Competitor launched loyalty program; we're seeing churn signals" (problem creating urgency). See Week 3 slide 12.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Clarity and Concision"

    question: |
      According to Strunk and White's "Omit needless words" principle, which phrase should replace "in order to"?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "to"
        feedback: "Correct! 'In order to' should always become 'to'—the meaning is identical, and you save 2 words without losing clarity."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "for the purpose of"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'For the purpose of' is even wordier than 'in order to.' The correct replacement is simply 'to.'"

      - key: "C"
        text: "so that we can"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'So that we can' is wordier than 'in order to.' The correct replacement is simply 'to.'"

      - key: "D"
        text: "with the intention of"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'With the intention of' is wordier than 'in order to.' The correct replacement is simply 'to.'"

    general_feedback: |
      "Omit needless words" is the most famous rule from <b>The Elements of Style</b> (classic writing guide). "In order to" should always become "to" (2 words saved, zero meaning lost). Other common offenders: "due to the fact that" → "because" (4 words saved), "at this point in time" → "now" (3 words saved). The goal: make every word earn its place. Most first drafts contain 20-30% unnecessary words—professional editing cuts these without losing meaning. See Week 3 slides 16-17.

  - id: "W3-Q8-active-vs-passive"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Clarity and Concision"

    question: |
      How do active voice and passive voice differ in business writing?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Active voice: subject performs action (clearer responsibility). Passive voice: subject receives action (less clear)"
        feedback: "Correct! Active = 'The team completed the report.' Passive = 'The report was completed by the team.' Active shows who did what clearly."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Active voice uses present tense; passive voice uses past tense"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both active and passive can use any tense (past, present, future). The difference is whether the subject performs or receives the action."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Active voice is for formal writing; passive voice is for informal writing"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Active voice is preferred for professional business writing (80%+ of sentences). Passive voice often sounds evasive or weak."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Active voice requires more words; passive voice is more concise"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Active voice is typically shorter than passive voice. 'We approved the budget' (active, 4 words) vs. 'The budget was approved by us' (passive, 6 words)."

    general_feedback: |
      Active voice means the subject performs the action: "The team completed the report" (subject = team, action = completed). Passive voice means the subject receives the action: "The report was completed by the team" (subject = report, receives action). Active voice clarifies responsibility, creates shorter sentences, and sounds more confident. Aim for 80%+ active voice in business writing. <b>Passive voice is acceptable when the actor is unknown</b> (irrelevant, unimportant) or when you want to emphasize the receiver of action rather than the doer. See Week 3 slide 18.

  - id: "W3-Q9-specific-language"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Clarity and Concision"

    question: |
      Why does Strunk and White's Rule 3 recommend using specific language over vague language?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Specificity builds credibility and allows readers to assess the accuracy of claims"
        feedback: "Correct! Specific language ('Sales increased 23%') sounds credible and expert. Vague language ('Sales increased significantly') sounds uncertain."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Specific language uses fewer words than vague language"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Specific language often uses similar or more words than vague language. The benefit is credibility, not brevity. 'Sales increased 23% quarter-over-quarter' (5 words) vs. 'Sales increased significantly' (3 words)."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Specific language is required for all business writing; vague language is never acceptable"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While specificity is preferred, vague language is acceptable when you don't have exact data—use 'approximately' or 'we estimate.' The rule is 'be as specific as your data allows.'"

      - key: "D"
        text: "Specific language sounds more polite and professional"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Specific language builds credibility and trust, not politeness. 'We need to implement changes by March 15' (specific) is more assertive than polite, but it's professional because it's clear."

    general_feedback: |
      Specific language builds <b>credibility</b> (trustworthiness, believability) and allows readers to evaluate your claims. "Sales increased 23% quarter-over-quarter" sounds expert and confident. "Sales increased significantly" makes readers ask "How much? How do you measure significance?" Vague qualifiers like "many," "soon," "significantly," "improve" undermine your authority. If you have specific data (numbers, dates, percentages), use it. If not, acknowledge the limitation: "approximately 50 customers" or "we estimate 20% increase." See Week 3 slide 19.

  - id: "W3-Q10-purpose-person-point"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Purpose-Person-Point Framework"

    question: |
      What are the three questions in the Purpose-Person-Point framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Purpose: What result do I want? Person: Who is my reader? Point: What's my essential message?"
        feedback: "Correct! This pre-writing framework clarifies intent before drafting. Purpose = your goal, Person = your audience, Point = your core message."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Purpose: Why am I writing? Person: How many readers? Point: When is the deadline?"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The three questions are: Purpose (what result do I want?), Person (who is my reader?), Point (what's my essential message?)."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Purpose: What's the problem? Person: Who caused it? Point: What's the solution?"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This sounds like problem-solving, not the Purpose-Person-Point framework. The framework asks: what result you want, who your reader is, and what your essential message is."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Purpose: What data do I have? Person: Who needs to approve? Point: What's the budget?"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Purpose-Person-Point asks: what result you want (inform, request, persuade?), who your reader is (what do they need to know?), and what your essential message is (main point in one sentence)."

    general_feedback: |
      The Purpose-Person-Point framework (from Danziger's 2024 HBR article) helps you clarify thinking before writing. <b>Purpose</b> (goal, objective) = What result do I want? (inform, request, or persuade?). <b>Person</b> (audience, reader) = Who is my reader? (what do they need to know?). <b>Point</b> (message, main idea) = What's my essential message? (can you state it in one sentence?). If you can't answer these three questions clearly, you're not ready to write yet. Spend 5 minutes on Purpose-Person-Point to save hours of unclear drafting. See Week 3 slide 22.

    topic: "What/So What/Now What Framework"

    question: |
      How do the What/So What/Now What and SCQA frameworks differ in their primary use?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "What/So What/Now What is better for quick updates and spontaneous communication; SCQA is better for formal documents"
        feedback: "Correct! What/So What/Now What = simple structure for emails, updates, impromptu speaking. SCQA = formal structure for memos, proposals, reports."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "What/So What/Now What requires more preparation; SCQA is easier to remember"
        feedback: "Incorrect. What/So What/Now What is actually simpler and easier to remember than SCQA. What/So What/Now What is designed for spontaneous communication."

      - key: "C"
        text: "What/So What/Now What is for written communication only; SCQA is for oral communication only"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both frameworks work for written and oral communication. The difference is formality: What/So What/Now What for quick updates, SCQA for formal documents."

      - key: "D"
        text: "What/So What/Now What is a McKinsey framework; SCQA is a Stanford framework"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SCQA is from Minto's Pyramid Principle (McKinsey). What/So What/Now What is taught by Matt Abrahams at Stanford, but the key difference is use case (quick updates vs. formal documents)."

    general_feedback: |
      Both frameworks create clear, action-oriented communication, but for different contexts. <b>What/So What/Now What</b> (simple, memorable) is better for quick updates, status reports, email responses, and <b>impromptu speaking</b> (spontaneous, unplanned speaking) because it's simple and easy to remember. <b>SCQA</b> (formal, comprehensive) is better for formal documents like memos, proposals, and reports because it creates more strategic context and urgency. What = facts, So What = relevance, Now What = action. SCQA = Situation, Complication, Question, Answer. Use whichever you remember more easily. See Week 3 slide 23.

  - id: "W3-Q12-framework-integration"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Framework Integration"

    question: |
      In what order should you apply the frameworks when writing a business document?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Purpose-Person-Point (clarify thinking) → Pyramid Principle (structure) → SCQA (opening) → Strunk & White (editing)"
        feedback: "Correct! Think first, structure second, write third, edit fourth. This sequence moves from clarity of intent to polished final document."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "SCQA (opening) → Pyramid Principle (structure) → Strunk & White (editing) → Purpose-Person-Point (review)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. You should clarify thinking (Purpose-Person-Point) BEFORE writing. Starting with SCQA before knowing your purpose leads to unclear drafts."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Strunk & White (editing) → SCQA (opening) → Pyramid Principle (structure) → Purpose-Person-Point (review)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. You can't edit sentences before writing them. The correct order: clarify thinking first, structure second, write third, edit fourth."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Pyramid Principle (structure) → Strunk & White (editing) → Purpose-Person-Point (thinking) → SCQA (opening)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. You should clarify your purpose and audience (Purpose-Person-Point) before structuring arguments. Think first, structure second, write third, edit fourth."

    general_feedback: |
      The correct writing process follows four stages: (1) <b>Clarify thinking</b> (clear, focused) using Purpose-Person-Point (know what you're writing and why), (2) <b>Structure argument</b> (organize, arrange) using Pyramid Principle (main answer + 3 supporting arguments), (3) <b>Craft opening</b> (write, compose) using SCQA (hook the reader with context and urgency), (4) <b>Edit sentences</b> (refine, polish) using Strunk & White rules (omit needless words, active voice, be specific). Most students reverse this: they write sentences first, then try to organize. Professionals think first, structure second, write third, edit fourth. The sentence-writing is easy when you've done the thinking and structuring. See Week 3 slide 24.
