**Topic:** Structured Business Writing
**Duration:** 90 minutes

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Pyramid Principle:** Think bottom-up (do analysis) but present top-down (state conclusion first, then provide 3 supporting arguments with data). This is the McKinsey standard for structured business communication.

- **SCQA Framework:** Structure document openings with Situation (accepted context), Complication (problem creating urgency), Question (what naturally arises), Answer (your recommendation).

- **MECE Principle:** Arguments must be Mutually Exclusive (no overlap) and Collectively Exhaustive (nothing relevant missing). This ensures logical rigor.

- **Clarity & Concision:** Omit needless words, use active voice 80%+ of the time, and replace vague language ("many," "soon") with specific data (numbers, dates).

**What good work looks like:**

- Organization (20% of rubric): Pyramid Principle masterfully applied; flawless logical flow
- Clear governing thought stated in first sentence
- Three distinct supporting arguments that are MECE
- SCQA opening creates context and urgency
- Active voice and specific language throughout

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Section 1 (Business Memo: Written Communication Rubric)

## Main Activity: Business Memo Draft (Pyramid Principle Practice)

**Assessment Connection:** Business Memo: Audience Analysis (Due Week 4) - this activity practices Pyramid Principle structure, the core organization skill for your graded memo

**The Task:**

You will draft a structured business memo using the Pyramid Principle and SCQA framework. This is a practice version of the Organization criterion from your Week 4 assessment rubric.

**Scenario:**

You are a junior manager at **VietTech Solutions**, a software company in Ho Chi Minh City. Your CEO has announced a new hybrid work policy requiring all employees to work in-office 3 days per week (up from 1 day currently). You must write a memo to your team explaining the policy change.

**Team composition:**
- 2 senior staff members (10+ years experience)
- 3 mid-level staff members (3-5 years experience)
- 5 recent graduates (less than 1 year experience)

**Known concerns:**
- Commute costs have increased 30% this year (fuel prices, parking)
- Some team members have caregiving responsibilities
- Current 1-day policy has maintained 95% productivity metrics
- Three team members live 60+ minutes from office

**Your task:** Draft a 200-word memo using Pyramid Principle to explain the policy change

**Deliverable:**

A 200-word business memo structured as follows:

1. **Professional memo header:**
   ```
   To: VietTech Development Team
   From: [Your Name], Team Manager
   Date: [Today's date]
   Subject: New Hybrid Work Policy - Effective March 1
   ```

2. **SCQA Opening paragraph (4-5 sentences):**
   - Situation: Current 1-day policy context
   - Complication: CEO's new 3-day requirement
   - Question: How will this affect our team?
   - Answer: Main point first (what team needs to know/do)

3. **Three supporting points (Pyramid Structure):**
   - Point 1: [Supporting information]
   - Point 2: [Supporting information]
   - Point 3: [Supporting information]
   - Must be MECE (no overlap, collectively complete)

4. **Call to action (1-2 sentences):**
   - Specific next steps for the team

**Success Criteria:** (from Written Communication Rubric - Organization 20%)

- **Pyramid Principle applied:** Recommendation/main point stated in first paragraph, not buried
- **Logical flow:** Supporting points follow naturally from main point
- **SCQA structure:** Opening creates context (S), urgency (C), frames question (Q), and answers it (A)
- **Active voice:** 80%+ of sentences use active voice
- **Specific language:** No vague qualifiers ("some," "soon"); use concrete details
- **Concision:** 200 words maximum (body of memo, excluding header)

**Resources:**

- Lecture Slide 6 (Pyramid Structure visual)
- Lecture Slide 11 (SCQA breakdown)
- Assessment Handbook Section 1 (Business Memo scenario for Week 4)

**Class Feedback:**

At the end of the session, 4-6 students will share their work. Be prepared to:

- Read your SCQA opening paragraph aloud
- Identify your main point and three supporting points
- Explain how you applied Pyramid Principle (main point first)
- Answer one question from peers

⚠️ **Participation:** You must produce a complete deliverable to share. Incomplete work will affect your participation marks (10% of final grade). Even if uncertain about quality, having a finished draft shows engagement.
