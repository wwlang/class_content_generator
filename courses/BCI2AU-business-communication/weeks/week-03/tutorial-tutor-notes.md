---

## Session Timing

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Quick Review | 5 min | Lecture recap + success criteria; keep brisk |
| Purpose-Person-Point Thinking | 10 min | Students clarify intent before writing |
| Structure Pyramid | 15 min | Build argument framework; check MECE |
| Draft SCQA Opening | 10 min | Focus on first paragraph only |
| Write Supporting Points | 20 min | Develop 3 points with specifics |
| Edit for Concision | 10 min | Cut to 200 words; apply Strunk & White |
| Class Feedback | 15 min | 4-6 students share (3 min each) |
| Before Next Class | 5 min | Review 3 items |

**Total:** 90 minutes

**Selection for feedback:** Random selection or volunteers. All students must have complete draft ready (participation requirement).

**If time short:** Reduce feedback to 3 sharers (2 minutes each), combine Structure + Draft phases (20 min total).

## Scenario Design Rationale

**Why this scenario aligns with Assessment Handbook:**

- Matches **Scenario Option A** from Assessment Handbook Section 1: "New Policy Communication"
- Same team structure (senior/mid/junior staff mix)
- Same concerns (commute costs, work-life balance)
- Tutorial version is 200 words; assessment version is 500-750 words
- Both require stakeholder mapping and Pyramid Principle

**Tutorial simplification:**

- Focuses on INTERNAL communication (team memo), not external
- Simpler task: explain policy vs. justify policy (persuasion comes Week 4)
- Emphasis on ORGANIZATION rubric criterion (Pyramid structure)
- Assessment adds audience analysis depth and strategic thinking

**Key difference:** This tutorial practices the structural skill (Pyramid Principle). Week 4 assessment adds audience analysis complexity.

## Valid Student Approaches

Students may structure their memos differently. All approaches below are valid if they use Pyramid Principle (main point first) and MECE supporting points:

### Approach 1: Supportive Tone (Emphasize Benefits)

**Main Point (Answer in SCQA):**
"The new 3-day policy takes effect March 1, and I'm committed to making this transition smooth for everyone."

**Three Supporting Points (MECE - could be):**

**Option A (Logistics/Support/Timeline):**
1. **Schedule flexibility:** Core days are Mon/Wed/Fri; you choose your third day from Tue/Thu
2. **Transition support:** HR is providing $50/month commute subsidy for 6 months
3. **Implementation timeline:** March 1 start gives us 3 weeks to plan; let's meet individually

**Option B (Benefits/Concerns/Next Steps):**
1. **Collaboration benefits:** More in-person time = faster project communication
2. **Addressing concerns:** Commute subsidy available; flexible hours (7am-10am start)
3. **Your input needed:** Please share your preferred third day by Friday

### Approach 2: Transparent Tone (Acknowledge Challenges)

**Main Point (Answer in SCQA):**
"While the new 3-day policy presents challenges, here's what I'm doing to support our team through this transition."

**Three Supporting Points (MECE - could be):**

**Option A (Challenge/Support/Action):**
1. **I understand concerns:** Commute costs and caregiving are real - I've escalated these to HR
2. **Available support:** $50/month subsidy, flexible hours, 1 work-from-home day on long-commute weeks
3. **Let's problem-solve together:** Team meeting Friday 2pm to discuss individual needs

**Option B (Impact/Mitigation/Timeline):**
1. **Schedule impact:** You'll be in office Mon/Wed/Fri plus one flex day (Tue or Thu)
2. **Mitigation measures:** Commute subsidy, compressed hours (4x10), carpool matching
3. **Gradual rollout:** Soft start March 1-15; full enforcement March 16

### Approach 3: Directive Tone (Policy Focus)

**Main Point (Answer in SCQA):**
"Effective March 1, all team members will work in-office 3 days per week as per CEO directive."

**Three Supporting Points (MECE - could be):**

**Option A (Requirements/Exceptions/Compliance):**
1. **Core requirements:** Monday/Wednesday/Friday mandatory; choose third day from Tue/Thu
2. **Exception process:** Special circumstances require HR approval; submit by Feb 20
3. **Tracking:** Badge swipe data will be reviewed monthly; questions come to me first

**Option B (Policy/Support/Expectations):**
1. **Policy details:** 3 days minimum; core hours 9am-4pm; lunch flexibility maintained
2. **Support available:** Commute subsidy application opens today; HR Q&A session Thursday
3. **Performance expectations:** Productivity metrics remain at 95%; deliverables unchanged

**Key Point for Tutor:** Don't favor one tone over another. Grade on:
- Pyramid structure (main point first)
- MECE supporting points
- SCQA opening
- Organization rubric criteria

Students exploring different tones is GOOD - shows audience awareness (Content & Strategy rubric criterion).

## Common Student Mistakes & How to Address

### Mistake 1: Building to Main Point (Violates Pyramid Principle)

**What it looks like:**
"Our team has worked remotely successfully for two years. The CEO has decided to change the policy. There are several factors to consider. After reviewing the options, I want to inform you that we will be transitioning to a 3-day in-office schedule."

**Why it's wrong:** Main point buried in sentence 4. Reader doesn't know the "so what" until the end. Violates Pyramid Principle.

**How to fix:** "State your main point in sentence 1 of the opening paragraph, right after the Answer in SCQA."

**Coaching tip:** Ask: "If your team has 10 seconds, what's the one thing they must know?" That's your first sentence after SCQA setup.

**Better version:**
"Our team has maintained 95% productivity with 1-day in-office schedules. **[S]** However, the CEO announced yesterday that all departments must transition to 3-day in-office work effective March 1. **[C]** How will this affect our team and workflows? **[Q]** Here's what you need to know: we'll work Mon/Wed/Fri in office, with flexible scheduling options to ease the transition. **[A - main point first]**"

---

### Mistake 2: Overlapping Supporting Points (Violates MECE)

**What it looks like:**
1. Flexible scheduling options available
2. You can choose your hours within core time
3. Commute subsidy to help with costs

**Why it's wrong:** Points 1 and 2 overlap - choosing hours IS a flexible scheduling option. Not mutually exclusive.

**How to fix:** Combine overlapping points or reorganize categories.

**Better version (logistics/financial/communication MECE):**
1. **Schedule options:** Choose your third day (Tue or Thu); flexible hours 7am-10am start
2. **Financial support:** $50/month commute subsidy for 6 months; carpool matching program
3. **Communication plan:** Individual check-ins next week; team meeting Friday to discuss concerns

**Coaching tip:** Ask: "Could I delete point 2 without losing information from point 1? If yes, they overlap."

---

### Mistake 3: Missing Complication in SCQA (No Urgency)

**What it looks like:**
"Our team works in the office 1 day per week. Should we change to 3 days? Yes, we're changing to 3 days effective March 1."

**Why it's wrong:** No complication = no context for why this matters NOW. Feels arbitrary.

**How to fix:** Add the "what changed" that creates urgency.

**Better version:**
"Our team has worked in-office 1 day per week for two years, maintaining 95% productivity. **[S]** Yesterday, the CEO announced a company-wide policy requiring all teams to transition to 3-day in-office schedules effective March 1, citing collaboration and culture-building as key reasons. **[C]** How will this affect our workflows and your personal schedules? **[Q]** Here's what you need to know immediately. **[A setup]**"

**Coaching tip:** Ask: "Why is this happening NOW? What changed?" That's your complication.

---

### Mistake 4: Vague Language (Violates Clarity Criterion)

**What it looks like:**
"Many of you may face challenges with the new policy. We will provide some support soon. Please let me know if you have concerns."

**Why it's wrong:** "Many," "some," "soon," "concerns" - all vague. No actionable information.

**How to fix:** Use specific numbers, dates, and concrete actions.

**Better version:**
"Three team members (30%) live 60+ minutes from the office and will face $200/month increased commute costs. HR is providing a $50/month subsidy starting March 1, and I'm requesting additional flexibility for our team. Please submit your preferred schedule (Tue or Thu third day) by Friday, February 24."

**Coaching tip:** Circle vague words. Ask: "Can you replace this with a specific number, date, or action?"

---

### Mistake 5: Missing Call to Action

**What it looks like:**
Memo explains the policy and supporting points but ends with "Thank you for your understanding."

**Why it's wrong:** Team doesn't know what to DO. Professional memos include clear next steps.

**How to fix:** Add specific, actionable next step with deadline.

**Better version:**
"Please reply to this email by Friday, February 24 with: (1) your preferred third in-office day (Tue or Thu), and (2) any special circumstances requiring HR discussion. I'll schedule individual check-ins next week to address concerns personally."

**Coaching tip:** Ask: "After reading this memo, what should your team DO? Write that as your final sentence."

## Facilitation Guidance by Phase

### Phase 1: Purpose-Person-Point (10 min)

**Goal:** Students clarify thinking before drafting.

**Instructions:**
"Before you write anything, answer three questions:
1. **Purpose:** What result do you want? (Here: Inform team of policy change + ease concerns)
2. **Person:** Who is your reader? (Your direct reports - mixed seniority levels)
3. **Point:** What's your main message in ONE sentence? Write it now."

**What to monitor:**
- Students write one clear sentence for "Point"
- Sentence should contain the essential information (3-day policy, start date, key implication)
- If they write 2+ sentences or hedge ("I think maybe..."), redirect: "One sentence. What MUST your team know?"

**Common issue:** Students write "I'm writing to inform you..." → Redirect: "Skip the preamble. What's the information?"

---

### Phase 2: Structure Pyramid (15 min)

**Goal:** Build argument skeleton before writing sentences.

**Instructions:**
"Now build your pyramid on paper:
- Top: Your main message (same as your Point)
- Second level: 3 supporting points (what your team needs to know to act on this information)
- Third level: Specific details for each supporting point

Use bullet points only - no full sentences yet. Check MECE: Do your 3 points overlap? Is anything important missing?"

**What to monitor:**
- Three supporting points are distinct categories (schedule, support, timeline OR logistics, financial, communication)
- Each supporting point has 1-2 specific details underneath
- No overlap between categories
- Collectively exhaustive (covers what team needs to know)

**MECE check questions:**
1. "If I deleted Point 2, would I lose information not in Point 1?" (If no, they overlap - not ME)
2. "Do these 3 points answer everything your team needs to know?" (If no, not CE)

**Common issue:** Students list 5-6 points. Redirect: "Group related points. Aim for 3 categories."

---

### Phase 3: Draft SCQA Opening (10 min)

**Goal:** Write first paragraph only, using SCQA.

**Instructions:**
"Write your opening paragraph - 4-5 sentences following SCQA:
1. **Situation:** Our team's current 1-day policy (accepted fact)
2. **Complication:** CEO's announcement of 3-day requirement (what changed)
3. **Question:** How does this affect us? (natural question reader has)
4. **Answer:** Your main message (from your Point)

Just this paragraph. Supporting points come next."

**What to monitor:**
- **Situation** is neutral, factual (1 sentence)
- **Complication** creates urgency with specifics (CEO announcement, March 1 date)
- **Question** flows naturally from complication
- **Answer** states main point directly, not buried

**Example check:** Point to each sentence and ask student: "Is this S, C, Q, or A?"

**Common issue:** Students write 3-sentence situation. Redirect: "Situation = 1 sentence establishing context. Then immediately introduce complication."

---

### Phase 4: Write Supporting Points (20 min)

**Goal:** Develop 3 supporting points with specific details.

**Instructions:**
"Now write your 3 supporting points. Each point should:
- Start with a clear category label (Schedule, Support, Timeline OR Logistics, Financial, Communication)
- Include 1-2 specific details from your pyramid outline
- Use active voice ('You will...' not 'It will be...')
- Be concise (2-3 sentences max per point)

Example:
'**Schedule flexibility:** Core in-office days are Monday, Wednesday, Friday. You'll choose your third day (Tuesday or Thursday) based on your personal needs and submit your preference by February 24.'"

**What to monitor:**
- Each point clearly labeled with category
- Specific details included (dates, numbers, options)
- Active voice ("You will," "HR provides," "I'm requesting")
- Concision (if point is 5+ sentences, too much detail)

**Common issue:** Students write paragraphs of explanation. Redirect: "State the point, give 1-2 specifics, move on. This is a memo, not a report."

---

### Phase 5: Edit for Concision (10 min)

**Goal:** Cut to exactly 200 words (body only, excluding header).

**Instructions:**
"Check your word count. Target is 200 words for the memo body (excluding header).

Edit using these steps:
1. Cut needless phrases: 'Due to the fact that' → 'Because', 'In order to' → 'To'
2. Remove redundancy: If you've said it once, don't repeat
3. Replace passive voice: 'Decisions will be made' → 'I will decide'
4. Tighten sentences: Can 2 sentences become 1?

Every word must earn its place."

**What to monitor:**
- Word count dropping toward 200
- Students actively cutting, not just tweaking
- Needless phrases disappearing
- Passive → active conversions

**Common needless phrases to flag:**
- "I would like to inform you that" → delete
- "It is important to note that" → delete
- "At this point in time" → "now"
- "In the event that" → "if"

**Common issue:** Students resist cutting because "it all feels important." Redirect: "Professional memos are concise. Your team is busy. Cut 20% and your memo gets STRONGER."

---

### Phase 6: Class Feedback (15 min)

**Goal:** Share work, learn from peers, reinforce Pyramid Principle.

**Process:**
1. Select 4-6 students (random or volunteer)
2. Each student shares (3 min):
   - Reads SCQA opening paragraph aloud
   - States main point and 3 supporting points
   - Explains: "I applied Pyramid Principle by [stating main point first / using MECE points]"
   - Takes 1 question from peers

**What to listen for:**
- Main point appears in first paragraph (Answer in SCQA)
- Three supporting points are MECE (ask class: "Are these mutually exclusive?")
- SCQA structure evident (can identify S, C, Q, A)
- Active voice and specific language used

**Facilitation tips:**
- After student reads, ask class: "Where was the main point? First sentence or last?"
- If Pyramid Principle violated (main point buried), ask: "How could we restructure to put main point first?"
- Praise specificity: "Great use of 'March 1' instead of 'soon' - that's specific language from Strunk & White."
- If points overlap, ask class: "Are these three points mutually exclusive or do some overlap?"

**Common student question:** "Is there ONE right structure?"
**Answer:** "No - multiple structures work. You're graded on Pyramid Principle (main point first), MECE logic, and SCQA opening. The specific points can vary."

## Rubric Alignment Reminder

**Week 4 Assessment Rubric - Organization (20%):**

| Grade Level | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Excellent (94-100%) | Pyramid Principle masterfully applied; flawless logical flow; reader effortlessly follows argument |
| Good (84-93%) | Strong structure; Pyramid Principle evident; logical flow with minor gaps |
| Satisfactory (74-83%) | Adequate structure; attempt at Pyramid Principle; flow somewhat unclear |

**Tutorial Success = hitting "Good" level:**
- Main point in first paragraph (Pyramid Principle evident)
- Three supporting points flow logically
- SCQA opening provides context and urgency

**Assessment Success = hitting "Excellent" level:**
- Same structure PLUS audience analysis depth (multiple stakeholder needs addressed)
- Same structure PLUS strategic thinking (Munter Framework applied)
- Same structure PLUS 500-750 words with sustained organization quality

**Emphasize to students:** "Today you're practicing the ORGANIZATION skill (20% of Week 4 grade). The assessment adds CONTENT & STRATEGY (30%) and AUDIENCE ANALYSIS. Structure comes first - that's what we're mastering now."

---

## Cultural Considerations (Vietnamese Context)

### Challenge 1: Directness in Main Point

**Vietnamese cultural norm:** Build context slowly; main point at end feels more respectful.

**Pyramid Principle requirement:** Main point first; context second.

**How to address:** "In Vietnamese communication, context first shows respect. In English business writing, **brevity = respect**. Busy readers appreciate getting the main point in 10 seconds. It's not rude - it's professional."

**Reframe:** "Think of Pyramid Principle as respect for your reader's TIME, not their RANK."

---

### Challenge 2: Avoiding Strong Statements (Hedging)

**Vietnamese cultural norm:** "Perhaps we could consider..." sounds more polite than "We will implement..."

**Business writing standard:** Direct statements show confidence and clarity.

**What you'll see:** Students write "It might be beneficial to possibly think about..."

**How to address:** "Hedging (using 'maybe,' 'possibly,' 'might') makes you sound uncertain. Your team needs CLARITY, especially with policy changes. Direct language = leadership."

**Coaching language:** "Replace 'We might consider...' with 'We will implement...' You're the manager - own the message."

---

### Challenge 3: Passive Voice = Formality

**Vietnamese cultural norm:** Passive voice sounds more formal/official.

**Business writing standard:** Active voice clarifies WHO does WHAT.

**What you'll see:** "The policy will be implemented" (passive - who's implementing?)

**How to fix:** "I will implement the policy" or "HR requires this policy" (active - clear actor)

**How to address:** "Active voice doesn't mean informal. It means CLEAR. Your team needs to know WHO to ask questions: you, HR, the CEO? Active voice clarifies."

---

### Challenge 4: Reluctance to Give Feedback (Group Harmony)

**Vietnamese cultural norm:** Avoid critique; maintain harmony.

**Feedback session requirement:** Constructive peer feedback.

**How to address:**
- Model feedback language: "I noticed the main point appeared in sentence 4. Moving it to sentence 1 would strengthen the Pyramid structure."
- Emphasize: "Feedback on WORK, not judgment of PERSON."
- Use "I noticed..." not "You did wrong..."
- Start with positive: "Strong SCQA opening - I could identify all four elements. One suggestion: move the main point earlier."

**Facilitation tip:** If silence during feedback, use pair-share first: "Turn to your neighbor. Find the main point in their memo - which sentence number?"

---

## Answers to Likely Student Questions

**Q: "Should my memo tone be supportive or directive?"**
A: "Either works. Choose based on YOUR management style and team relationship. Supportive emphasizes help available; directive emphasizes compliance needed. Both can use Pyramid Principle effectively."

**Q: "Can my main point be 'I know this is challenging'?"**
A: "No - that's acknowledging the problem, not delivering the key information. Main point should be: what's happening, when, and what team should do. Example: 'Effective March 1, we're transitioning to 3-day in-office work with schedule flexibility options.'"

**Q: "Is 200 words enough to cover everything?"**
A: "Yes - that's the skill. Professional memos are concise. Your Week 4 assessment is 500-750 words where you'll add audience analysis depth. Today: practice tight structure in 200."

**Q: "What if I have 4 supporting points, not 3?"**
A: "Can you group 2 of them? MECE often reveals that 4 points can be organized into 3 categories. Example: 'schedule options' and 'flexible hours' both belong under 'Scheduling.' Three is the consulting standard."

**Q: "Should I mention specific team members' concerns (e.g., 'Sarah lives far away')?"**
A: "No - keep memo general to respect privacy. Say '3 team members live 60+ minutes away' (anonymous data). Address individual situations in 1-on-1 conversations."

**Q: "Can I use bullet points for the 3 supporting points?"**
A: "Yes - bullets are great for memo readability. Format: Bold category header, then 1-2 sentences of detail."

**Q: "What's the difference between Situation and Complication in SCQA?"**
A: "Situation = accepted baseline (what's always been true). Complication = what CHANGED (new information, problem, urgency trigger). In this scenario: Situation = '1-day policy for two years', Complication = 'CEO announced 3-day requirement yesterday.'"

**Q: "Should my SCQA Question be literal ('Should we adopt this?') or implied?"**
A: "Can be literal or implied. Literal: 'How will this affect our team?' Implied: 'Here's what this means for you.' Both work as long as Answer follows naturally."

**Q: "Is 'Thank you for your understanding' a good closing?"**
A: "Weak - it assumes understanding and doesn't give next steps. Better: 'Please submit your preferred schedule by Friday, February 24. I'll schedule check-ins next week to address individual concerns.' Call to action > pleasantry."

## Extension Activity (If Time Remains)

**Unlikely, but if students finish significantly early:**

**Peer MECE Check (5 min)**

1. Partner with neighbor
2. Exchange drafts
3. Each person checks partner's supporting points:
   - Do any points overlap? (Circle overlaps)
   - Is anything important missing? (Note gaps with "?")
   - Are all 3 points needed, or could you combine two?
4. Discuss findings (2 min)
5. Revise based on feedback (3 min)

**Debrief:** "Fresh eyes catch logic gaps you miss in your own work. Did your partner find overlaps or gaps you hadn't seen?"

---

## Materials Checklist

**Tutor should provide/confirm:**
- Scenario details visible (projector or printed handout)
- Word count tool access (MS Word, Google Docs, or wordcounter.net)
- Sample SCQA opening (from lecture Slide 12) on screen for reference
- Timer for feedback phase

**Students should have:**
- Laptop or paper for drafting
- Access to lecture slides (especially Slides 6, 11, 16-18)
- Tutorial-content.md open or printed

**Optional but helpful:**
- Strunk & White editing checklist handout (needless phrases list)
- Pyramid Principle visual template
- Sample memo format template

---

## Post-Tutorial Follow-Up

**Encourage students to:**
1. Complete their memo if unfinished and self-check against success criteria
2. Compare their structure to Assessment Handbook Section 1 requirements (same Pyramid Principle, scaled up)
3. Review Week 3 lecture slides before Quiz 3 (Pyramid Principle, SCQA, MECE)
4. Note the structure they practiced: Organization = 20% of Week 4 memo grade

**Remind students:**
- Quiz 3 due Sunday 11:59 PM (covers Pyramid Principle, SCQA, MECE, Strunk & White)
- Pre-reading for Week 4 (Cialdini persuasion article)
- Save draft - this structure forms foundation of graded Week 4 memo
- Week 4 lecture adds PERSUASION to this STRUCTURE framework

**If students request help:**
- Office hours available (confirm instructor schedule)
- Peer study groups encouraged for quiz prep
- Remind: "Pyramid Principle is a skill. First time feels unnatural. It gets easier with practice - that's why we're doing this NOW before the graded assessment."
