</role>
<instructions>
1. Create a presentation slide deck with exactly 41 slides
2. The first slide in the lecture content IS the title slide - add course name (Business Communication), university (Andrews University), and campus (NEU, Vietnam) to it
3. Reproduce the exact wording from the lecture content for each slide, preserving all text as written
4. Generate creative visuals for each slide: pictures, infographics, icons, and diagrams that reinforce the slide's message
5. Use a minimum 18pt font for all text. Reference text and footer text is allowed to be smaller
6. Add a footer to every content slide (not the title slide) with: course name, university, topic, and slide number
7. Place academic citations (e.g., Minto, 1987) in the slide footer when referenced in content
8. Leave speaker notes sections empty
9. The final slide is a References slide - format it cleanly with the full APA citations provided

2. Data Visualization Principles (25 min)
3. Slide Design in Practice (25 min)

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Segment 1 Start">

## Part 1: The Science of Visual Processing

Understanding how audiences process visual information

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning">

## How We Process Visual Information

**Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML)**

**Three Core Assumptions:**

1. **Dual-Channel Processing** - Visual and auditory information processed separately
2. **Limited Capacity** - Each channel holds only 5-7 chunks simultaneously
3. **Active Processing** - Learning requires selecting, organizing, integrating information

**Implication:** Poor design overloads one channel while underutilizing the other

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Three Types of Cognitive Load">

## Managing Cognitive Load

| Load Type | Definition | Your Design Strategy |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Inherent complexity of the material | Manage through segmenting, pre-training |
| **Extraneous** | Wasted effort from poor design | **Minimize** - remove distractions |
| **Germane** | Productive effort for understanding | **Optimize** - support schema building |

**Goal:** Minimize extraneous, optimize germane

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Mayer's 12 Principles - Overview">

## Mayer's 12 Principles of Multimedia Learning

**Three categories of principles:**

**Reducing Extraneous Processing:**
- Coherence, Signaling, Redundancy, Spatial Contiguity, Temporal Contiguity

**Managing Essential Processing:**
- Segmenting, Pre-training, Modality

**Fostering Generative Processing:**
- Multimedia, Personalization, Voice, Image

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Reducing Extraneous Processing">

## Category 1: Reducing Extraneous Processing

**Coherence Principle (d = 0.70):**
- Exclude extraneous material
- Remove decorative clip art, unnecessary logos, background patterns
- Every element must serve a purpose

**Signaling Principle (d = 0.46):**
- Highlight essential material with cues
- Use arrows, bold text, color to direct attention
- Help audiences know what matters most

**Redundancy Principle (d = 0.87):**
- Don't present identical information in multiple forms simultaneously
- Graphics + narration beats graphics + narration + on-screen text

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Spatial and Temporal Contiguity">

## More Extraneous Processing Principles

**Spatial Contiguity Principle (d = 1.11):**
- Place text near corresponding graphics
- Don't make eyes travel between legend and chart
- Integrated labels beat separated legends

**Temporal Contiguity Principle (d = 1.22):**
- Present narration and animation simultaneously
- Don't show graphic, then explain 30 seconds later
- Synchronize words and visuals

**Business Application:** Direct labels on charts instead of legends; explain while showing, not before or after

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Managing Essential Processing">

## Category 2: Managing Essential Processing

**Segmenting Principle (d = 0.84):**
- Break complex content into learner-paced segments
- One idea per slide
- Allow time to process before advancing

**Pre-training Principle (d = 0.85):**
- Introduce key concepts and terms before complex explanation
- Build foundation first
- Reduce cognitive load when presenting main content

**Modality Principle (d = 1.02):**
- Use spoken narration instead of on-screen text with graphics
- Leverage dual channels effectively
- Graphics + speech beats graphics + text

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="Fostering Generative Processing">

## Category 3: Fostering Generative Processing

**Multimedia Principle (d = 1.67):**
- Use words AND pictures together
- Most powerful effect: Graphics with narration beats text alone
- Don't rely on text-only slides

**Personalization Principle (d = 0.79):**
- Use conversational style instead of formal language
- "You can see..." beats "It can be observed that..."
- Creates engagement and deeper processing

**Voice and Image Principles (d = 0.50-0.73):**
- Human voice beats machine voice
- Adding instructor image has modest benefit
- Focus on voice quality over talking-head video

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Key Principles Summary">

## Most Impactful Principles for Business Presentations

**Top 5 by Effect Size:**

1. **Multimedia Principle (d = 1.67):** Words + Pictures together
2. **Temporal Contiguity (d = 1.22):** Synchronize words and visuals
3. **Spatial Contiguity (d = 1.11):** Place labels near graphics
4. **Modality (d = 1.02):** Narration instead of on-screen text
5. **Redundancy (d = 0.87):** Don't read on-screen text aloud

**Practical Application:** Every slide should combine visual + spoken explanation, with integrated labels and no decorative elements

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="Before and After Example">

## Applying Mayer's Principles

**Before (violates principles):**
- Decorative background image of office (Coherence)
- Bullet points read verbatim by speaker (Redundancy)
- Text-only slide, no visuals (Multimedia)
- Three complex concepts on one slide (Segmenting)
- Legend separated from chart (Spatial Contiguity)

**After (follows principles):**
- Clean white background (Coherence)
- Simple diagram showing concept (Multimedia)
- Minimal text labels only (Modality)
- One concept per slide (Segmenting)
- Direct labels on graphics (Spatial Contiguity)

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2 Start">

## Part 2: Data Visualization Principles

Making numbers clear, honest, and impactful

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="framework" title="Data-Ink Ratio">

## Tufte's Data-Ink Ratio

**Definition:** The proportion of a graphic's ink devoted to displaying actual data

**Formula:** Data-Ink Ratio = Data-ink ÷ Total ink used

**Tufte's Five Laws:**
1. Above all else, show the data
2. Maximize the data-ink ratio
3. Erase non-data-ink (within reason)
4. Erase redundant data-ink (within reason)
5. Revise and edit continuously

**Goal:** Every visual element must earn its place

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Data-Ink Ratio in Practice">

## Maximizing Data-Ink: What to Remove

**Non-Data-Ink to Eliminate:**
- Heavy borders around chart area
- Background colors and patterns
- Decorative gridlines (or make very faint)
- Chart frames and boxes
- Redundant axis labels

**Data-Ink to Emphasize:**
- Actual data points (bars, lines, dots)
- Minimal axis labels showing scale
- Direct labels identifying what data represents
- Trend lines or annotations explaining patterns

**Test:** Can I remove this element without losing information? If yes, remove it.

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="Chartjunk">

## Chartjunk: What to Eliminate

**Definition:** Unnecessary or confusing visual elements that do not convey data

**Three Categories:**

1. **Moiré Vibration** - Dense patterns creating optical interference
   - Crosshatching, tight diagonal lines, busy textures

2. **Heavy Grids** - Overly prominent gridlines dominating chart area
   - Dark gridlines, dense grid spacing, unnecessary grid boxes

3. **Self-Promoting Graphics ("Ducks")** - Decorative forms overtaking data
   - 3D effects, pictorial bars, ornamental flourishes

**Common Chartjunk to Remove:**
- 3D effects on 2D data (distorts perception)
- Decorative backgrounds (distracts from data)
- Unnecessary colors (creates visual noise)
- Ornamental borders and shadows

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Chartjunk Examples">

## Chartjunk in Business Presentations

**Moiré Vibration Example:**
- Bar chart with diagonal line patterns filling each bar
- Creates optical buzzing, hard to compare values
- Solution: Solid colors or subtle gradients only

**Heavy Grids Example:**
- Dark black gridlines every 5 units
- Grid visually competes with data
- Solution: Very light gray lines at major intervals only, or remove entirely

**Duck Example:**
- 3D pie chart with perspective and shadows
- Different slices appear different sizes due to angle
- Solution: Simple 2D chart with direct percentage labels

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="framework" title="Graphical Integrity">

## Graphical Integrity & The Lie Factor

**Goal:** Visual representations must truthfully convey data

**Lie Factor Formula:** Size of effect shown in graphic ÷ Size of effect in data

**Interpretation:**
- Lie Factor = 1 → Accurate representation (ideal)
- Lie Factor > 1 → Overstates effect
- Lie Factor < 1 → Understates effect

**Six Principles of Graphical Integrity:**
1. Physical measurements directly proportional to quantities
2. Use clear, detailed labeling
3. Show data variation, not design variation
4. Use standardized units for monetary time-series
5. Information dimensions should not exceed data dimensions
6. Don't quote data out of context

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Lie Factor Examples">

## Detecting Visual Dishonesty

**Example 1: Area Distortion**
- Data: Sales doubled from $50M to $100M (2x increase)
- Visual: Bar is 2x taller AND 2x wider (4x area)
- Lie Factor: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 (overstates by 100%)

**Example 2: Truncated Axis**
- Data: Performance increased from 92% to 95% (3 percentage points)
- Visual: Y-axis starts at 90%, making 3% look like 60% of chart height
- Lie Factor: ~20 (massive overstatement)

**Example 3: Pictorial Charts**
- Data: Population doubled
- Visual: Person icon twice as tall AND twice as wide (4x area)
- Lie Factor: 4 ÷ 2 = 2

**Solution:** Always check that visual magnitude matches data magnitude

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Practical Application - Tufte">

## What to Do: Tufte's Guidelines in Action

**Design Checklist:**

**Remove:**
- 3D effects and shadows
- Background colors and patterns
- Heavy gridlines (or make very faint gray)
- Borders around chart area
- Separate legends (use direct labels instead)
- Unnecessary colors (limit to 1-2 accent colors)
- Decorative icons and clip art

**Keep:**
- Actual data points (bars, lines, markers)
- Minimal axis labels showing scale
- Direct labels on data (not in separate legend)
- One or two colors for strategic emphasis
- White space for visual clarity
- Context necessary for interpretation

<slide number="24" layout="section-break" title="Segment 3 Start">

## Part 3: Slide Design in Practice

Contemporary research and strategic frameworks

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="framework" title="When to Use Visualization">

## MIT Sloan: Data Presentation Matrix

**Matching format to insight complexity and purpose:**

| Insight Type | Simple Information | Sophisticated Information |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Exploratory** | AI chat interfaces | Interactive dashboards |
| **Explanatory** | AI-infused BI tools | **Data stories/presentation decks** |

**Key Distinction:**
- Exploratory = Answering questions ("What were Q3 sales?")
- Explanatory = Persuading audiences to act on insights ("We should invest in X because...")

**Your presentations = Explanatory + Sophisticated = Data stories required**

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="Exploratory vs Explanatory">

## Understanding the Distinction

**Exploratory Tools (Dashboards):**
- User drives the analysis
- Answer: "Let me explore the data to find insights"
- Self-service, interactive, flexible
- Examples: Tableau dashboards, Power BI reports, SQL queries

**Explanatory Tools (Data Stories):**
- Presenter drives the narrative
- Answer: "Here's what the data means and what we should do"
- Curated, sequential, persuasive
- Examples: Presentation decks, executive reports, infographics

**When to use which:**
- Dashboards for analysts exploring patterns
- Data stories for executives making decisions

</slide>

<slide number="27" title="Case Study - Strategic Decision">

## When Data Stories Are Essential

**Scenario:** Product head presenting to executive board

**Challenge:** Justify $50 million investment for new product launch

**Why data story, not dashboard:**
- Explanatory purpose (persuade to approve)
- Sophisticated information (customer data + projections + market analysis + competitor intelligence)
- High-stakes decision requiring full context
- Board needs curated narrative, not exploratory tool
- 30-minute presentation window to make the case

**Result:** Human-crafted data story provided integrated context for strategic decision

**Key Elements:**
- Customer research showing unmet need
- Market sizing demonstrating $500M opportunity
- Competitive landscape showing differentiation
- Financial projections with risk analysis
- Implementation timeline

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="framework" title="The Curse of Expertise">

## Kellogg Research: The Curse of Expertise

**Problem:** Presenters see what's important in a graph and assume audiences do too—they are typically wrong

**Why it happens:**
- You've spent hours analyzing the data
- Patterns obvious to you are invisible to first-time viewers
- Your expertise becomes a blind spot
- You can't "unsee" what you know

**Research Finding:** 67% of business presentations fail to communicate their main point

**Root Cause:** Data cannot "speak for itself"—active guidance required

**The mistake:** "This chart clearly shows..." (No, it doesn't—not to others)

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Curse of Expertise Example">

## The Expert's Blind Spot

**What the expert sees:**
- Immediately notices Region 3 underperforming
- Recognizes seasonal pattern from previous years
- Connects to competitor launch in that region
- Sees implications for Q4 strategy

**What the audience sees:**
- A bar chart with many bars
- Some bars taller, some shorter
- No clear pattern
- Confusion about what matters

**The gap:** The expert's week of analysis created mental models the audience doesn't have

**Solution:** You must explicitly guide attention to what matters

</slide>

<slide number="30" layout="framework" title="Declutter + Focus Technique">

## The Solution: Declutter + Focus

**Kellogg's empirical findings:**

| Technique | Effect on Comprehension |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Decluttering alone** | Improves appearance; minimal cognitive benefit (~30% accuracy) |
| **Decluttering + Focus** | **~2.5x improvement** in capturing main conclusion (~75% accuracy) |

**Why decluttering alone fails:**
- Clean design is necessary but not sufficient
- Removing chartjunk doesn't tell audiences what to see
- Still leaves interpretation burden on viewer

**Focus techniques required:**
- Add headlines explaining trends (not just describing data)
- Use color to highlight key data points
- Limit to 1-2 colors maximum
- Write what the data means, not what it shows
- Add annotations pointing to critical information

</slide>

<slide number="31" title="Focus Techniques Breakdown">

## How to Focus Attention

**1. Explanatory Headlines:**
- Bad: "Regional Sales Q4"
- Good: "Asia-Pacific Sales Declined 18% in Q4"
- The headline does cognitive work for the audience

**2. Strategic Color Use:**
- Highlight the important data point in accent color (red for problems, blue for focus)
- Make everything else muted gray
- Never use color without meaning

**3. Direct Annotations:**
- Add text boxes pointing to key features
- "Peak sales during holiday season"
- "Competitor launch caused dip"

**4. Visual Hierarchy:**
- Bold the key number
- Larger font for main message
- Secondary details in smaller, lighter text

</slide>

<slide number="32" title="Before and After - Declutter + Focus">

## Applying Declutter + Focus

**Before (decluttered only):**
- Clean design, no chartjunk (Tufte compliant)
- Simple bar chart showing regional sales
- Clear labels and minimal gridlines
- Good data-ink ratio
- BUT: No indication of what matters
- Viewers ask: "What's the point?"

**After (decluttered + focused):**
- Same clean design foundation
- Headline: "Asia-Pacific sales declined 18% in Q4"
- One bar highlighted in red (Asia-Pacific)
- Other bars in muted gray for context
- Annotation: "Competitor X launched in September"
- Audiences immediately see the story

**The difference:** Active guidance on what to see and why it matters

</slide>

<slide number="33" title="Focus Technique Examples">

## Real-World Applications

**Financial Reports:**
- Before: Line chart of monthly revenue (all months same color)
- After: Same chart, but Q4 highlighted with annotation "New product launch drove 40% growth"

**Marketing Dashboards:**
- Before: Pie chart of traffic sources (6 rainbow colors)
- After: Same chart, organic search highlighted in blue, rest in gray, headline "Organic search drives 62% of conversions"

**Operations Updates:**
- Before: Bar chart of defect rates by factory (neutral colors)
- After: Factory 3 highlighted in red, annotation "Equipment failure in Week 23," headline "Factory 3 defect rate spiked 300% after equipment failure"

**Common Thread:** Every chart tells one clear story through headline + color + annotation

</slide>

<slide number="34" title="Practical Checklist">

## Your Slide Design Checklist

**Before you finalize any slide:**

**Step 1 - Mayer Check:**
- Does it follow Coherence (no extraneous elements)?
- Does it follow Redundancy (not reading displayed text aloud)?
- Does it follow Multimedia (combining words and pictures)?
- Spatial Contiguity (labels near graphics)?

**Step 2 - Tufte Check:**
- Can I remove any ink without losing data information?
- Is the data-ink ratio maximized?
- Are there any chartjunk elements (3D, decorations, heavy grids)?
- Does the visual magnitude match the data magnitude (Lie Factor = 1)?

**Step 3 - Focus Check:**
- Does a first-time viewer immediately know what matters?
- Is there an explanatory headline stating the conclusion?
- Is strategic color highlighting the key insight?
- Are annotations guiding interpretation?

</slide>

<slide number="35" title="For Data Visualizations">

## Data Visualization Specific Checklist

**Step 4 - Remove Clutter:**
- Eliminate borders around chart area
- Lighten or remove gridlines
- Remove background colors and patterns
- Delete decorative elements and 3D effects
- Replace legend with direct labels

**Step 5 - Identify Your Story:**
- What's the one main point this chart makes?
- Write it as an explanatory headline
- If you have multiple points, create multiple charts

**Step 6 - Add Focusing Elements:**
- Headline stating conclusion (not description)
- Color highlighting key data (1-2 colors max, rest gray)
- Annotations explaining significant features
- Bold or larger text for key numbers

**Step 7 - Test:**
- Show to colleague who hasn't seen it
- Ask: "What's the main point?"
- If they can't answer in 5 seconds, add more focus

</slide>

<slide number="36" title="Common Mistakes to Avoid">

## Common Slide Design Mistakes

**Cognitive Overload:**
- Too much text (>150-200 words on body slides)
- Multiple concepts per slide
- Reading bullet points verbatim
- Dense paragraphs instead of visual elements

**Visual Clutter:**
- Decorative backgrounds and clip art
- Unnecessary logos on every slide
- 3D effects, shadows, and reflections
- Busy patterns and textures
- Rainbow color schemes without meaning

**Poor Focus:**
- Charts with no clear main point
- Descriptive titles instead of explanatory headlines
- Equal visual weight to all elements
- No guidance on what to look at first

**Integrity Issues:**
- Truncated axes exaggerating trends
- Inconsistent scales between charts
- Cherry-picked data without context
- Visuals that overstate effects (Lie Factor > 1)

</slide>

<slide number="37" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

**Three frameworks to remember:**

**1. Mayer's CTML: Manage cognitive load through dual-channel processing**
   - Coherence: Remove extraneous elements
   - Redundancy: Don't read text aloud
