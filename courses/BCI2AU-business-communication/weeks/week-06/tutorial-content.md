# Week 6 Tutorial: Visual Communication & Slide Design

**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12, 25% of grade) - this activity practices slide design for the final presentation. You'll apply Duarte's Resonate principles, Mayer's cognitive load theory, and Tufte's data visualization frameworks to create professional-quality slides.

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer):** The brain processes visual and auditory information through separate channels with limited capacity (5-7 chunks each). Poor slide design overloads one channel while underutilizing the other, causing comprehension failure.

- **Three Types of Cognitive Load:** Intrinsic (inherent complexity), Extraneous (wasted effort from bad design—MINIMIZE this), Germane (productive understanding—OPTIMIZE this). Every design choice should reduce extraneous load.

- **Mayer's Key Principles:**
  - **Coherence (d = 0.70):** Exclude decorative clip art, borders, unnecessary elements
  - **Redundancy (d = 0.87):** Don't write full sentences you'll read aloud—use keywords only
  - **Spatial Contiguity (d = 0.79):** Place labels directly on graphics, not in separate legends

- **Tufte's Data-Ink Ratio:** Maximize the proportion of ink devoted to actual data vs. decoration. Remove gridlines, backgrounds, 3D effects, decorative patterns (chartjunk) that don't convey information.

- **Kellogg Focus Technique:** Decluttering alone provides NO cognitive benefit. Must add focusing elements: headlines stating conclusions + strategic color highlighting key data. This produces ~2.5x comprehension improvement.

- **Duarte Resonate Framework:** Effective presentations move audiences from "what is" to "what could be" through contrast and visual storytelling.

**What good work looks like:**
- Professional-quality slides with perfect visual hierarchy (from Presentation Rubric - Visual Design 15%)
- Clear data visualization that enhances message (not decorative)
- Strategic use of color (1-2 colors max) to guide attention
- Each slide has clear purpose supporting persuasive narrative

## Main Activity: Design a 3-Slide Persuasive Mini-Deck

**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12) - Visual Design criterion (15%) evaluates "Professional-quality slides; perfect visual hierarchy; enhances message." This activity practices creating slides that meet rubric standards.

**The Task:**
Design 3 slides for a persuasive business presentation using today's frameworks. Your mini-deck should tell a cohesive story that moves the audience from problem to action.

**Scenario:**
You are a sustainability coordinator presenting to your company's Executive Committee. You are requesting $25,000 to implement a plastic waste reduction initiative that will reduce company plastic waste by 50% over 2 years.

**Deliverable:**
3-slide mini-deck (hand-drawn sketches, PowerPoint, or detailed written descriptions) consisting of:

1. **Slide 1: Problem/Data Visualization**
   - Show current plastic waste data with visual hierarchy
   - Apply Tufte's data-ink ratio and focus technique
   - Include headline that states conclusion (not just data description)
   - Use chart/graph to visualize the problem

2. **Slide 2: Solution/Visual Hierarchy**
   - Present your solution with clear visual structure
   - Apply Mayer's coherence and spatial contiguity principles
   - Use visual elements (icons, diagrams, or framework) to show process
   - Minimize text - let visuals communicate

3. **Slide 3: Call to Action**
   - Clear, specific request with next steps
   - Compelling visual that reinforces urgency or opportunity
   - Apply focus technique to direct attention to key ask

**Success Criteria:** (from Group Presentation Rubric - Visual Design 15%)
- Professional-quality slides that enhance rather than distract from message
- Perfect visual hierarchy - audience eye flows naturally to most important elements
- Effective data visualization (Slide 1) using Tufte's principles and focus technique
- Strategic color use (1-2 colors max) to guide attention
- No chartjunk or extraneous cognitive load (Mayer's coherence principle applied)
- Each slide serves clear persuasive purpose in narrative arc

**Resources:**
- Lecture slides 6-17 (Mayer, Tufte, Focus Technique, Duarte frameworks)
- Assessment Handbook Section 4 (Persuasive Proposal scenarios for context)
- Quick reference: Data-ink ratio maximizes information per pixel; Focus = Declutter + Headline + Strategic color

**Class Feedback:**
At the end of the session, 4-6 students will share their mini-decks. Be prepared to:
- Walk through your 3 slides explaining the persuasive narrative
- Identify specific principles applied on each slide (name them: "coherence," "data-ink ratio," "focus technique")
- Explain one design decision and its cognitive load impact
- Answer one question from peers about your design choices

**Tips for Success:**
- Start with Slide 1 data: What chart type best shows plastic waste problem? (Bar chart comparing current vs. target? Trend line showing increase over time?)
- Add focus elements: Headline stating "Current Plastic Waste Exceeds Industry Average by 40%" is better than "Plastic Waste Data"
- Use color strategically: Highlight key data in one color, gray out supporting context
- Test the "curse of expertise": Can a classmate understand your slides without your explanation?

⚠️ **Participation:** You must produce a deliverable (3-slide deck + ability to explain design choices) to share. Incomplete work will affect your participation grade (10% of course grade). All students must be prepared to share; selection will be random or by volunteer.

## Before Next Class

1. **Complete Online Quiz** - Week 6 Quiz on Moodle (due Sunday 11:59 PM). Quiz covers Mayer's principles, Tufte's concepts, cognitive load types, focus technique, and MIT Sloan framework.

2. **Pre-reading for Week 7** - Cialdini, R. B. (2006). *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* (Rev. ed., Ch. 1-3). Available on Moodle. Next week covers persuasive presentations and storytelling.

3. **Save Your Work** - Keep your 3-slide mini-deck for reference when creating Week 12 presentation materials. Your design process notes will help you make evidence-based choices under time pressure.

4. **Reminder:** Persuasive Proposal (Portfolio Assessment 2, 15% of grade) is due next week (Week 7). This tutorial's persuasive structure practice applies to your written proposal as well.
