## Slide 1: The Curse of Expertise
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

**Most business data visualizations have fundamental design flaws.**

Research shows presenters assume audiences see what they see in graphs and slides—they are typically wrong.

(Kellogg Study, 2021)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome to Week 6 on Visual Communication & Slide Design
- Quick context: You've been working on written communication; now we shift to visual

**Key Points:**
- "Curse of expertise" is a research-validated phenomenon from Northwestern's Kellogg School
- When you create a slide, you KNOW what's important—but your audience doesn't
- This is why copying charts directly from Excel fails in presentations
- Today we learn the science behind effective visual communication

**Example:**
- Think about the last PowerPoint you saw with too much text—presenter understood it perfectly, but audience was confused
- Vietnamese business context: Many VietNamese corporate presentations use dense slides with extensive detail—this reflects the curse

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick show of hands—have you ever been confused by a slide the presenter thought was clear?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see what today will help you avoid..."

---

## Slide 2: Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Mayer's principles to reduce cognitive load in slides
2. **Evaluate** visualizations using Tufte's data-ink ratio
3. **Design** slides that guide audience attention using visual hierarchy
4. **Identify** when visualization is essential vs. when AI tools suffice

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Four objectives today—all directly support Week 12 presentation preparation

**Key Points:**
- **Apply Mayer's principles:** We'll learn 12 research-backed design rules from cognitive psychology
- **Evaluate with Tufte:** The data-ink ratio helps you eliminate clutter systematically
- **Design with visual hierarchy:** Focus technique proven to improve comprehension 2.5x
- **Identify tool selection:** New MIT framework for choosing visualization vs. AI (relevant for your careers)

**Example:**
- Objective 3 (visual hierarchy) directly connects to portfolio piece requirements—you need clear structure in your Week 12 deck

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which of these four feels most immediately relevant to your upcoming presentation?"

**Transition:**
- "Before diving in, let's see how today connects to your graded work..."

---

## Slide 3: Assessment Connection
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Group Presentation (Week 12): 25% of Course Grade**

This week's content prepares you to:
- **Create professional slides** that enhance rather than distract from your message
- **Visualize data effectively** if your presentation includes statistics or comparisons
- **Manage cognitive load** so your audience absorbs your key points
- **Apply evidence-based design** rather than guessing what looks good

**Full rubric criteria:** Assessment Handbook, Section 12

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Your Week 12 presentation is worth 25% of your final grade—visual design is a graded criterion

**Key Points:**
- Assessment Handbook Section 12 shows specific visual design criteria: clarity, data visualization quality, cognitive load management
- Today's frameworks (Mayer, Tufte) are the foundation of those rubric criteria
- Tutorial this week: You'll practice redesigning cluttered slides using today's principles
- This is practical skill-building, not theory—you'll use these techniques in three weeks

**Example:**
- Past student example: Group lost 15% of visual design marks for cluttered slides with too much text—exactly what Mayer's coherence principle prevents

**Check Understanding:**
- "How many of you have already started thinking about your Week 12 presentation visuals?"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's see the roadmap for today's journey..."

---

## Slide 4: Today's Roadmap
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Part 1:** The Science of Visual Processing (20 min)
- Cognitive load theory
- Mayer's multimedia learning principles

**Part 2:** Visual Clarity Frameworks (20 min)
- Tufte's data-ink ratio
- Eliminating chartjunk

**Part 3:** Guiding Audience Attention (20 min)
- The focus technique
- Strategic tool selection

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Three clear segments today, about 20 minutes each

**Key Points:**
- **Part 1 (Science):** Understanding WHY design principles work—brain science foundations
- **Part 2 (Clarity):** Practical frameworks for eliminating clutter and distraction
- **Part 3 (Attention):** Actively guiding your audience to see what matters
- We'll have brief engagement activities at each segment transition

**Example:**
- Part 1 gives you the "why," Parts 2-3 give you the "how"—by the end you'll have actionable design rules

**Check Understanding:**
- No question—this is roadmap only

**Transition:**
- "Let's begin with the foundational science: how does the human brain process visual information?"

---

## Slide 5: PART 1 - The Science of Visual Processing
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Understanding cognitive load and multimedia learning**

---

## Slide 6: How the Brain Processes Multimedia
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2009)**

**Three Core Assumptions:**
1. **Dual-Channel Processing:** Visual and auditory information processed separately
2. **Limited Capacity:** Each channel handles only 5-7 chunks simultaneously
3. **Active Processing:** Learning requires selecting, organizing, and integrating information

**Implication:** Poor slide design overloads one channel while underutilizing the other, causing comprehension failure.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This theory explains why bad slides make audiences confused even when content is simple

**Key Points:**
- **Dual-channel:** You have two processing pipes—visual (what you see) and auditory (what you hear)
- **Limited capacity:** Each pipe is NARROW—only 5-7 pieces of information fit through at once
- **Active processing:** Your brain must actively work to connect visual and auditory; it doesn't happen automatically
- When slides have dense text AND you're talking, the visual channel gets clogged—audience reads OR listens, not both

**Example:**
- Bad slide: Paragraph of text + speaker talking = visual channel overloaded, auditory underused
- Good slide: Simple visual + speaker talking = both channels working efficiently

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about a time you couldn't read a slide because the presenter was talking—that's dual-channel overload. Sound familiar?"

**Transition:**
- "This theory leads to three types of cognitive load we need to manage..."

---

## Slide 7: Three Types of Cognitive Load
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

| Load Type | Definition | Design Strategy |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Intrinsic Load** | Inherent complexity of material | Manage through segmenting, pre-training |
| **Extraneous Load** | Wasted effort from poor design | **MINIMIZE** - Remove distractions |
| **Germane Load** | Productive effort for understanding | **OPTIMIZE** - Support schema building |

**Your goal:** Minimize extraneous load so audience energy goes to germane load.

(Mayer, 2009; Sweller, 2011)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Not all cognitive load is bad—we want to eliminate wasteful load and maximize productive load

**Key Points:**
- **Intrinsic load:** Some topics are just hard—calculus has higher intrinsic load than addition. You can't eliminate this, only manage it.
- **Extraneous load:** This is the enemy—wasted brain power caused by bad design (decorative clip art, confusing layout, unnecessary animations)
- **Germane load:** This is GOOD load—brain working to understand your actual message and build mental models
- Every design choice should ask: Does this reduce extraneous or support germane?

**Example:**
- Slide with rotating text animation = HIGH extraneous (brain distracted by motion), LOW germane (not helping understanding)
- Slide with simple diagram showing process flow = LOW extraneous (clean design), HIGH germane (building mental model)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can someone give me an example of extraneous load you've seen in a presentation?"

**Transition:**
- "Now we know the brain science—let's see Mayer's 12 principles that minimize extraneous load..."

---

## Slide 8: Mayer's 12 Principles of Multimedia Learning
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Principles for REDUCING Extraneous Processing:**
1. **Coherence** - Exclude extraneous material (no decorative clip art)
2. **Signaling** - Add cues highlighting organization (arrows, bold)
3. **Redundancy** - Don't add on-screen text to narrated graphics
4. **Spatial Contiguity** - Place words near corresponding graphics
5. **Temporal Contiguity** - Present words and pictures simultaneously

**Principles for MANAGING Essential Processing:**
6. **Segmenting** - One idea per slide
7. **Pre-training** - Teach key concepts before complex content
8. **Modality** - Use spoken words rather than printed text with graphics

(Mayer, 2009)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Twelve principles—today we'll focus on the top 5 most relevant for business presentations

**Key Points:**
- These aren't opinions—each principle has been tested with effect size statistics (d = X.XX means how strong the effect is)
- **Coherence (d = 0.70):** Removing extraneous material has LARGE effect on learning
- **Redundancy (d = 0.87):** One of the strongest effects—don't put paragraphs on slides you're reading aloud
- **Spatial contiguity (d = 0.79):** Labels should be ON the diagram, not in a separate legend
- **Segmenting:** Vietnamese students often want comprehensive slides—but one idea per slide works better

**Example:**
- Coherence violation: Stock photo of diverse business people shaking hands on a finance slide (looks professional but adds zero information)
- Spatial contiguity: Chart with legend at bottom vs. labels directly on data lines—second version is faster to understand

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which principle do you think gets violated most often in business presentations?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see these principles in action with before-and-after examples..."

---

## Slide 9: Before/After - Coherence Principle
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

**BEFORE:**
- Slide with title, 3 bullet points, decorative border, clip art image, animated transition
- Dense paragraph text
- Multiple font colors for "visual interest"

**AFTER:**
- Same title, same 3 bullets
- Clean white background
- One simple, purposeful visual
- Single font color

**Result:** Audience attention goes to CONTENT, not decorative elements.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Same information, completely different cognitive load

**Key Points:**
- Before slide: Decorative elements (border, clip art, multiple colors) create extraneous load
- After slide: Every element serves the message—nothing wasted
- Coherence effect size d = 0.70 means removing extraneous elements improves learning significantly
- Vietnamese corporate culture sometimes values "polished" slides with many visual elements—research shows simpler is better

**Example:**
- Common mistake: Using PowerPoint's built-in themes with decorative sidebars and footers on every slide
- Better: Blank canvas, add only what serves your message

**Check Understanding:**
- "Look at the 'before' slide—what could you remove without losing any information?"

**Transition:**
- "Coherence removes clutter. Now let's talk about the redundancy principle, which addresses text vs. speech..."

---

## Slide 10: The Redundancy Principle
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

**"Don't add on-screen text to narrated graphics."**

— Richard Mayer, Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning

**Effect size: d = 0.87** (very large effect)

When you read text aloud that's also on the slide, the visual channel gets overloaded. Audience can either READ or LISTEN, not both.

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is the principle most violated in business presentations

**Key Points:**
- **The problem:** Presenter creates slides with full sentences, then reads them verbatim
- **Why it fails:** Audience's visual channel is processing text while auditory channel receives same words—brain can't sync them efficiently
- **Effect size d = 0.87:** Among the strongest effects Mayer found—this matters
- **Solution:** Slides have SHORT cues (keywords, phrases); YOU provide the full explanation verbally

**Example:**
- Bad: Slide says "Our revenue increased 15% year-over-year due to expansion in the northern market and improved customer retention strategies." Presenter reads it word for word.
- Good: Slide says "Revenue: +15% YoY." Presenter explains: "Let me walk you through this growth. We saw 15% revenue increase, driven by two factors: northern market expansion and better retention..."

**Check Understanding:**
- "How many of you have caught yourself reading slides word-for-word? Be honest—I've done it too!"

**Transition:**
- "We've covered cognitive load theory and Mayer's principles. Now let's shift to visual clarity frameworks from Tufte..."

---

## Slide 11: PART 2 - Visual Clarity Frameworks
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**Tufte's principles for honest, effective data visualization**

---

## Slide 12: Tufte's Data-Ink Ratio
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Formula:**
Data-Ink Ratio = Data-ink ÷ Total ink used to print the graphic

**Equivalently:**
1 − (proportion of ink that can be erased without loss of data-information)

**Tufte's Law:** Maximize the data-ink ratio. Every visual element must earn its place.

**Five Laws of Data-Ink:**
1. Above all else, show the data
2. Maximize the data-ink ratio
3. Erase non-data-ink (within reason)
4. Erase redundant data-ink (within reason)
5. Revise and edit continuously

(Tufte, 2001)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Edward Tufte is the godfather of data visualization—his work appears in Harvard, Stanford, Wharton curricula

**Key Points:**
- **Data-ink ratio:** What percentage of your chart's visual elements actually convey information vs. decoration?
- **"Above all else, show the data":** If you remove an element and data understanding doesn't change, that element was wasted
- Tufte's approach is SUBTRACTIVE—start with chart, remove everything unnecessary
- Every gridline, background color, border, shadow must justify its existence

**Example:**
- Excel default chart: Gray background, heavy gridlines, 3D effects, gradient fills
- Tufte-optimized chart: White background, minimal gridlines, flat colors, direct labels
- Vietnamese example: Many Vietnamese business reports use colorful, elaborate charts—Tufte would simplify 80% of those elements

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's one element you've seen on charts that probably adds no information? Shout it out!"

**Transition:**
- "When data-ink ratio is low, you have what Tufte calls 'chartjunk'—let's define it..."

---

## Slide 13: Chartjunk - The Enemy of Clarity
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Definition:** Unnecessary or confusing visual elements that do not convey data—all visual embellishments not essential to understanding.

**Three Categories:**
1. **Moiré Vibration:** Patterns creating optical interference (cross-hatching, dense patterns)
2. **Heavy Grids:** Overly prominent gridlines dominating chart area
3. **Self-Promoting Graphics ("Ducks"):** Decorative forms overtaking data (3D pie charts, pictorial bars)

**Elements to Eliminate:**
- 3D effects on 2D data
- Decorative backgrounds
- Unnecessary colors
- Ornamental borders
- Clip art in data displays
- Redundant legends

(Tufte, 2001)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Chartjunk" is Tufte's term for visual noise—it sounds harsh, but it's accurate

**Key Points:**
- **Moiré vibration:** Dense patterns that create visual shimmer—hurts eyes, distracts from data
- **Heavy grids:** When gridlines are darker than data lines, you're emphasizing the wrong thing
- **"Ducks":** Tufte's metaphor—architecture term for buildings shaped like objects (a building shaped like a duck). In charts: bars shaped like money bags, pie charts exploded in 3D
- Why this matters: Chartjunk increases extraneous cognitive load (connecting back to Mayer)

**Example:**
- 3D pie chart: Perspective distorts proportions—front slices look bigger than back slices even with same data
- Vietnamese business context: PowerPoint templates with decorative borders and backgrounds on every slide = chartjunk

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can someone describe the worst chartjunk you've ever seen in a presentation?"

**Transition:**
- "Eliminating chartjunk is one side—the other side is ensuring graphical integrity..."

---

## Slide 14: Graphical Integrity & The Lie Factor
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Lie Factor Formula:**
Lie Factor = Size of effect shown in graphic ÷ Size of effect in data

**Interpretation:**
- **>1:** Graphic overstates effect
- **<1:** Graphic understates effect
- **=1:** Accurate (ideal)

**Six Principles of Graphical Integrity:**
1. Physical measurements must be directly proportional to quantities represented
2. Use clear, detailed, thorough labeling
3. Show data variation, not design variation
4. Use deflated/standardized units for monetary time-series
5. Information dimensions should not exceed data dimensions
6. Don't quote data out of context

(Tufte, 2001)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is about ethical data visualization—your slides must truthfully represent information

**Key Points:**
- **Lie factor:** If revenue doubled but you show it with a bar 5x taller, lie factor = 5/2 = 2.5 (overstating)
- **Why it matters:** Your credibility vanishes when audiences detect visual manipulation
- **Common violations:** Starting Y-axis at non-zero to exaggerate small changes; using area/volume for linear data (doubling height AND width quadruples area)
- Vietnamese business context: Pressure to "make results look good" can lead to integrity violations—resist this

**Example:**
- Bad: Chart showing 10% vs 12% growth starts Y-axis at 9%—makes 2% difference look huge
- Good: Same chart with Y-axis at 0%—shows 2% difference proportionally
- Tufte quote: "Credibility vanishes in clouds of chartjunk; who would trust a chart that looks like a video game?"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why would you lose credibility if someone discovers your chart exaggerates data?"

**Transition:**
- "We've covered how to REDUCE clutter and ensure INTEGRITY. Now Part 3: How to actively GUIDE attention..."

---

## Slide 15: PART 3 - Guiding Audience Attention
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**The focus technique and strategic tool selection**

---

## Slide 16: The Declutter + Focus Model
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

**Kellogg Research Finding (2021):**

| Technique | Effect on Comprehension |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Decluttering Only** | Improves appearance, NO cognitive benefit |
| **Declutter + Focus** | **~2.5x improvement** in capturing main conclusion |

**Critical Insight:** Presenters see what's important in a graph and assume audiences do too—they are typically wrong.

**Solution:** Active guidance required. Data cannot "speak for itself."

(Kwok, 2021 - Kellogg Insight)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This research finding surprised even the researchers—decluttering alone doesn't help understanding

**Key Points:**
- **The study:** Northwestern tested 24 participants viewing graphs in three conditions (cluttered, decluttered, decluttered+focused)
- **Unexpected result:** Decluttered graphs looked better but didn't improve comprehension vs. cluttered
- **Key finding:** Only decluttered+focused showed significant improvement (~2.5x better)
- **Implication:** You must TELL audiences what to see—remove clutter AND add focusing elements

**Example:**
- Decluttered graph: Clean, minimal, professional—but audience still misses the key trend
- Decluttered+focused graph: Same clean design PLUS headline stating conclusion + color highlighting key data = comprehension jumps

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why do you think decluttering alone isn't enough to help audiences understand?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down exactly what 'focusing' means in practice..."

---

## Slide 17: The Focus Technique - Practical Steps
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**How to Apply Focus:**

1. **Identify Your Main Point:** What single story does your data tell?
2. **Remove Clutter:** Eliminate borders, excess gridlines, unnecessary colors
3. **Add Headline:** State your conclusion explicitly above the chart
4. **Use Color Strategically:** Highlight key data; gray out supporting context
5. **Limit Colors:** Maximum 1-2 colors (more creates visual noise)
6. **Test with Colleagues:** Verify your intended story comes through

**Result:** Audience immediately sees what you want them to see.

(Kwok, 2021 - Kellogg Insight)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Six concrete steps you can apply in tutorial today and for Week 12 presentation

**Key Points:**
- **Step 1 (Main point):** Most presenters skip this—they show data without deciding the story. You must be able to say "This chart shows X" in one sentence.
- **Step 3 (Headline):** Not a title describing what data IS ("Q3 Revenue by Region")—a headline stating what data MEANS ("Northern Region Drives Q3 Growth")
- **Step 4 (Color):** One data series in color (the important one), others in gray—eye naturally goes to color
- **Step 5 (Limit colors):** Study found max 1-2 colors optimal—more colors = more extraneous load
- Vietnamese context: Vietnamese design aesthetics often favor multiple bright colors—research says restraint is better

**Example:**
- Before: Multi-colored bar chart with title "Revenue by Quarter"—audience scans all bars equally
- After: Same chart, Q4 bar in blue, others in gray, headline "Q4 Revenue Exceeded Target by 23%"—audience instantly sees Q4

**Check Understanding:**
- "What would happen if you used 6 different colors for 6 data series?"

**Transition:**
- "We've covered slide design and visualization. Let's zoom out: When should you even use visualization vs. newer tools like AI?"

## Slide 18: Strategic Tool Selection Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**MIT Sloan 2×2 Matrix: Choosing Data Presentation Tools**

| Insight Type | Information Level | Best Tool |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Exploratory | Simple | AI chat interfaces |
| Explanatory | Simple | AI-infused BI tools |
| Exploratory | Sophisticated | Interactive dashboards |
| Explanatory | Sophisticated | **Data stories / Presentation decks** |

**Key Distinction:** Dashboards are for exploration; data stories are for persuasion and decision-making.

**Your Week 12 Presentation:** Explanatory + Sophisticated = Human-crafted data story required

(Kesari, 2024 - MIT Sloan Management Review)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is a 2024 framework addressing a current question: With AI tools, do we still need slides?

**Key Points:**
- **Exploratory vs. Explanatory:** Exploratory = audience discovers insights; Explanatory = you guide to conclusion
- **Simple vs. Sophisticated:** Simple = single metric or trend; Sophisticated = multi-faceted with context
- **Why presentations still matter:** High-stakes, sophisticated decisions require human-crafted narratives that integrate multiple data sources
- Your Week 12 presentation = explanatory (you're persuading) + sophisticated (multiple concepts) = you must create compelling visual story

**Example:**
- Simple exploratory: "What was our sales number last month?" → Ask AI chatbot
- Sophisticated explanatory: Convincing board to invest $50M in product launch → Craft visual presentation integrating customer data, projections, competitor analysis

**Check Understanding:**
- "Where would your Week 12 presentation fall on this matrix? Exploratory or explanatory?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see this framework with a real case study..."

---

## Slide 19: Case Study - Strategic Board Presentation
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Context:** Product head presenting to executive board to justify $50 million investment for new product launch

**Challenge:** Provide full context for sophisticated strategic decision across multiple data sources

**Action:** Created comprehensive data story integrating:
- Customer data showing demand
- Financial projections with scenarios
- Market analysis of opportunity size
- Competitor intelligence on gaps
- Internal capability assessment

**Result:** Board had sufficient context to make high-stakes decision with confidence

**Lesson:** AI tools can't synthesize multi-source narratives for strategic persuasion—this requires human-crafted visual storytelling

(Kesari, 2024 - MIT Sloan Management Review)

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Real example from MIT Sloan article showing when presentations are essential

**Key Points:**
- **Why AI couldn't do this:** Decision required synthesis across customer, financial, market, competitor, internal capability data—AI chatbot gives answers, not strategic narrative
- **Human value-add:** Presenter chose what to emphasize, framed story, anticipated objections, designed flow
- **$50M stakes:** High-stakes decisions need human judgment in communication, not algorithm-generated summaries
- Your careers: You'll face situations like this—ability to craft compelling visual stories is valuable skill

**Example:**
- Vietnamese business context: Presenting to company leadership for budget approval, new initiative, strategic pivot—these all need human-crafted stories

**Check Understanding:**
- "What would be lost if this product head just sent the board a ChatGPT summary of the data?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's move to key takeaways and how to apply everything we've covered..."

---

## Slide 20: Key Takeaways

1. **Cognitive load matters:** Design slides to minimize extraneous load (Mayer's principles)
2. **Simplicity wins:** Maximize data-ink ratio; eliminate chartjunk (Tufte)
3. **Guide attention actively:** Declutter + focus technique improves comprehension 2.5x (Kellogg)
4. **Choose tools strategically:** High-stakes persuasion requires human-crafted visual stories (MIT Sloan)
5. **Test your slides:** Curse of expertise means what's obvious to you may confuse audiences

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Five core takeaways—write these down if you haven't already

**Key Points:**
- **Takeaway 1:** Every design choice should ask "Does this reduce extraneous or support germane load?"
- **Takeaway 2:** When in doubt, remove elements—simpler slides almost always work better
- **Takeaway 3:** Don't assume audiences will "get it"—use headlines and color to direct attention
- **Takeaway 4:** For Week 12, remember you're crafting explanatory sophisticated story—tool selection matrix says presentation deck is correct choice
- **Takeaway 5:** Test your slides with a friend before presenting—if they miss your point, redesign

**Example:**
- Apply these in tutorial today: You'll redesign cluttered slides using these exact principles

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which takeaway feels most actionable for your Week 12 presentation?"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's preview your tutorial activity and what's coming next..."

---

## Slide 21: Tutorial Preview - Slide Redesign Workshop

**Today's Activity:** Redesign cluttered slides using Mayer's principles, Tufte's data-ink ratio, and the focus technique

**You'll Practice:**
- Identifying extraneous cognitive load
- Applying coherence and redundancy principles
- Eliminating chartjunk
- Adding focusing elements (headlines, strategic color)

**Deliverable:** One redesigned slide with explanation of design choices

**Class Feedback:** 4-6 students will share their redesigns and explain their reasoning

## Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Tutorial directly applies today's frameworks—this is practical skill-building

**Key Points:**
- You'll receive "before" slides with common design problems (too much text, chartjunk, missing focus)
- Your job: Apply specific principles we learned today to create "after" versions
- You must explain WHICH principles you applied and WHY—not just "it looks better"
- This practice prepares you for Week 12 slide creation—same skills, your own content

**Example:**
- Sample "before" slide might have paragraph text, decorative clip art, multi-colored bar chart with no headline
- Your "after" might have bullet points, removed clip art, single-color highlighting with descriptive headline
- You'd explain: "Applied coherence (removed clip art), redundancy (shortened text), focus (added headline and color)"

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between saying 'I made it simpler' vs. 'I applied Mayer's coherence principle by removing extraneous decorative elements'?"

**Transition:**
- "After tutorial, here's what's coming next week..."

- Open floor for any questions on today's content

**Key Points:**
- Common questions to anticipate:
  - "Can we use decorative images if they're relevant to topic?" → Only if they serve germane load; most "relevant" images are still extraneous
  - "How do we know if we have too much text?" → Redundancy principle: If you're saying it, don't write full sentences on slide
  - "What if our data is genuinely complex?" → Use segmenting (multiple slides) and pre-training (build up concepts gradually)
  - "Can we use PowerPoint templates?" → Only if template is minimal; most built-in themes violate coherence principle

**Example:**
- If student asks about specific design choice for their Week 12 presentation, ask them: "What principle from today applies? Does it reduce extraneous load?"

**Check Understanding:**
- This is Q&A slide—respond to student questions

**Transition:**
- After answering questions: "Great questions. Let's move to tutorial where you'll apply these principles hands-on. See you there!"
