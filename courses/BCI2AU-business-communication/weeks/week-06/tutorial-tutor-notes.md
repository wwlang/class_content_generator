## Valid Student Approaches

Students may take multiple valid paths. Here are 3-5 approaches that demonstrate strong understanding:

### Approach 1: Data-Driven Problem Emphasis
**Slide 1:** Bar chart comparing company's current plastic waste (100 tons/year) vs. industry average (60 tons/year) + competitor best practice (40 tons/year). Headline: "Our Plastic Waste Exceeds Industry Average by 67%." Company bar in red, others in gray. Apply focus technique (headline + color) and Tufte's data-ink ratio (minimal gridlines).

**Slide 2:** Three-step process diagram with icons: (1) Audit current usage → (2) Replace single-use plastics → (3) Monitor & report. Minimal text, visual flow left-to-right. Apply Mayer's coherence (no decorative elements) and spatial contiguity (labels on diagram).

**Slide 3:** Bold headline "Invest $25,000 to Save $40,000 Annually" with subtext "Decision needed by [date]." Simple visual showing cost vs. savings over 2 years. Apply redundancy principle (minimal text, presenter explains verbally).

**Why valid:** Strong data visualization, clear narrative arc (problem → solution → action), explicit application of frameworks.

---

### Approach 2: Trend-Based Urgency
**Slide 1:** Line graph showing company plastic waste increasing 15% annually over past 5 years vs. industry decreasing 10% annually. Headline: "While Industry Reduces Waste, Ours Grows 15% Yearly." Company line in red trending up, industry line in gray trending down. Apply focus technique and graphical integrity (Y-axis at zero).

**Slide 2:** Split-screen "What Is" vs. "What Could Be" visual (Duarte Resonate principle). Left side: current state with wasteful practices imagery. Right side: sustainable future with reusable alternatives. Apply coherence (purposeful images only, not decorative).

**Slide 3:** Simple checklist visual with 3 action items: "Approve $25,000 budget," "Launch Q1 2026," "Achieve 50% reduction by 2027." Bold headline: "Three Steps to Sustainability Leadership." Apply visual hierarchy (largest text = key ask).

**Why valid:** Urgency created through trend data, Duarte framework explicitly applied, clear action steps.

---

### Approach 3: Financial ROI Focus
**Slide 1:** Stacked bar chart showing cost breakdown of current plastic purchasing ($50,000/year) + waste disposal ($15,000/year) + regulatory risk ($25,000 potential fines). Headline: "Plastic Costs Us $90,000 Annually—And Growing." Apply data-ink ratio (remove chartjunk) and focus (headline states implication).

**Slide 2:** Timeline visual showing implementation phases over 24 months with key milestones. Use icons for each phase (audit, procurement, training, monitoring). Apply spatial contiguity (labels directly on timeline, no separate legend) and Mayer's segmenting principle (one idea per phase).

**Slide 3:** Simple 2x2 comparison table: "Option A: Status Quo" vs. "Option B: Invest $25,000." Show 5-year costs ($450,000 vs. $200,000). Headline: "Recommendation: Approve Option B." Apply visual hierarchy (Option B highlighted in color, Option A grayed out).

**Why valid:** Financial framing appeals to Executive Committee audience, clear cost-benefit analysis, professional table design.

---

### Approach 4: Environmental + Brand Narrative
**Slide 1:** Pie chart showing sources of company plastic waste (40% packaging, 30% food service, 20% office supplies, 10% other). Headline: "60% of Our Waste Comes from Two Controllable Sources." Highlight packaging + food service slices in blue, others in gray. Apply focus technique.

**Slide 2:** Before/After visual comparison. "Before" image with plastic waste problem annotated. "After" image with sustainable alternatives annotated. Minimal text, let visuals tell story. Apply Mayer's modality principle (visuals + verbal explanation, not redundant text).

**Slide 3:** Bold statement: "Become Vietnam's First Plastic-Neutral Company by 2027." Subtext: "$25,000 investment unlocks competitive advantage." Visual: company logo with sustainability badge. Apply coherence (purposeful branding image, not decorative) and focus (bold headline draws eye).

**Why valid:** Brand differentiation angle (strategic for marketing-focused executives), strong visual storytelling, clear value proposition.

---

### Approach 5: Stakeholder Impact Map
**Slide 1:** Multi-series bar chart showing plastic waste by department (Operations: 40 tons, Facilities: 30 tons, Sales: 20 tons, Other: 10 tons). Headline: "Operations & Facilities Account for 70% of Waste." Operations bar in color, others grayed. Apply focus technique and data-ink ratio.

**Slide 2:** Stakeholder impact diagram showing benefits for each group: Employees (healthier workplace), Customers (brand trust), Investors (risk mitigation), Community (environmental leadership). Apply visual hierarchy (icons + keywords for each stakeholder, minimal text).

**Slide 3:** Gantt chart visual showing project timeline with clear milestones and decision point highlighted: "Approve by [Date] to Launch Q1 2026." Apply spatial contiguity (dates directly on timeline) and focus (decision point in color).

**Why valid:** Stakeholder-centered approach (sophisticated executive communication), comprehensive impact consideration, clear timeline.

## Common Misconceptions to Address

### Misconception 1: "More Slides = More Persuasive"
**Student concern:** "Can I add extra slides to explain more details?"

**Response:** Three slides is intentional constraint—forces prioritization. Executive audiences value concision. Your Week 12 presentation will have 10-15 slides total, so 3 slides here is realistic practice for a key section. If you need more detail, add it to SPEAKER NOTES, not more slides. Mayer's redundancy principle: slides show keywords/visuals, YOU provide verbal elaboration.

**Action:** Show example of 10-slide deck vs. 3-slide deck with same content—second is more impactful because each slide carries weight.

---

### Misconception 2: "I Need Real Data for Slide 1"
**Student concern:** "I don't know actual plastic waste numbers—should I research real statistics?"

**Response:** For this tutorial, you can use plausible invented data—focus is on DESIGN PRINCIPLES, not data accuracy. Make numbers realistic enough to be believable (e.g., "100 tons/year" not "5 million tons/year" for single company). What matters: Is your chart type appropriate? Did you apply focus technique? Is data-ink ratio optimized? In Week 12 real presentation, you'll use real data—today is design practice.

**Action:** Emphasize this is safe space to experiment with design without data collection pressure.

---

### Misconception 3: "Charts Must Be Complex to Look Professional"
**Student concern:** "My bar chart feels too simple—should I add more data series?"

**Response:** Simplicity IS professionalism. Kellogg research shows audiences comprehend simple, focused charts 2.5x better than complex ones. Tufte: "Above all else, show the data"—but only the data that supports your main point. If you have one key comparison (current waste vs. target), a simple bar chart with 2 bars is perfect. Adding unnecessary series creates extraneous cognitive load.

**Action:** Show Apple keynote slides (famously simple charts) vs. typical corporate slides (cluttered multi-series charts). Ask: Which company seems more confident in their message?

---

### Misconception 4: "Call to Action Should Be Subtle"
**Student concern:** "Isn't it too aggressive to say 'Approve $25,000 budget'? Should I soften it to 'Consider approving'?"

**Response:** Slide 3 is your ASK—be direct and specific. Executive audiences respect clarity and decisiveness. Vague language ("consider," "perhaps," "if possible") signals uncertainty. Your job: Make the decision easy by being clear about what you need and when. Effective CTAs: "Approve $25,000 by March 15," "Greenlight pilot program," "Authorize procurement." Weak CTAs: "Think about this opportunity," "Consider the possibility."

**Action:** Compare weak vs. strong CTA examples. Ask: Which presenter would you fund?

---

### Misconception 5: "I Should Use Vietnamese Design Aesthetics"
**Student concern:** "Should I use bright colors and decorative elements common in Vietnamese business presentations?"

**Response:** Research-based design principles (Mayer, Tufte) are universal—they're based on how human brains process information, not cultural preferences. While Vietnamese business culture may favor more elaborate visuals, cognitive load theory shows simpler designs improve comprehension across all cultures. You can acknowledge cultural context: "I know Vietnamese presentations often use more color, but for international/Western executive audiences or research-backed effectiveness, restraint is better." For Week 12, if presenting to Vietnamese audience, discuss this trade-off with your group.

**Action:** Show research citations (Mayer's principles tested across cultures with consistent results). Emphasize evidence-based approach.

## Facilitation Tips

### For Quiet Groups (Common in Vietnamese Context)

**Challenge:** Students work silently and hesitate to share or ask questions.

**Strategies:**
1. **Pair-share first:** At 50-minute mark, have students pair up and walk through their 3 slides with a partner (5 min each). This rehearsal reduces pressure of full-class sharing.
2. **Frame as "design decisions," not "right answers":** Emphasize multiple valid approaches exist—you're curious about their reasoning, not evaluating correctness.
3. **Cold call gently:** "Let's hear from someone who used a bar chart for Slide 1—who'd like to share?" Wait 5-10 seconds. If no volunteer: "I'll randomly select... how about [name]?" Smile and be encouraging.
4. **Validate incomplete work:** If student says "I'm not finished," respond: "That's okay! Walk us through what you have and explain which principles you're applying. Progress deserves recognition."

### If Students Struggle with Slide 1 Data Visualization

**Challenge:** Student says "I don't know what chart to use."

**Response:** "Let's think about your MESSAGE first. What do you want the Executive Committee to see? A comparison? A trend? A breakdown?"

**Follow-up chart selection guide:**
- Comparison between categories → Bar chart
- Trend over time → Line graph
- Part-to-whole breakdown → Pie chart (but use sparingly—often bar chart is better)
- Relationship between variables → Scatter plot (advanced)

**Goal:** Choose chart type based on story, not aesthetics. Form follows function.

### Handling Enthusiastic "Overdesigners"

**Challenge:** Student creates elaborate multi-color design with animations, gradients, complex icons.

**Response:** Appreciate their effort, then redirect: "Your creativity is excellent! Now let's apply the research lens—does each element reduce extraneous or support germane load? Let's audit element by element using Mayer's coherence principle..."

**Goal:** Channel enthusiasm toward evidence-based design rather than creativity for its own sake. Creativity should serve clarity, not replace it.

### If Students Ask About Tools

**Challenge:** "Should I use PowerPoint, Canva, or hand-drawn sketches?"

**Response:** Any format works for tutorial—focus is on principles, not polish. Hand-drawn sketches showing clear visual hierarchy are better than fancy PowerPoint with poor design. That said, for Week 12 real presentation, use digital tools (PowerPoint, Google Slides, Canva). Today: Choose whatever lets you experiment fastest.

**Recommendation:** If you're new to design, start with hand sketches to think through layout, then digitize if time permits.

## Cultural Considerations (Vietnamese Context)

### Hierarchical Communication Norms
- **Consideration:** Vietnamese students may hesitate to make bold requests (Slide 3 CTA) if it feels disrespectful to authority.
- **Strategy:** Frame CTA as standard business practice: "In Western/international business contexts, executives expect direct requests—it helps them make decisions efficiently. Being clear about your ask shows confidence and preparation, not disrespect." For Vietnamese audiences, discuss adapting language while keeping clarity.

### Preference for Comprehensive Information
- **Consideration:** Vietnamese business culture often values thoroughness—3 slides may feel insufficient.
- **Strategy:** Explain executive communication norms: "Senior leaders have limited time—3 minutes to see your slides before meeting. Your 3 slides are the headline; you provide details verbally during presentation and Q&A. Comprehensive doesn't mean 'everything on slides'—it means strategic selection of what to visualize vs. explain."

### Face-Saving in Feedback
- **Consideration:** Public sharing of imperfect work may feel uncomfortable if students worry about "losing face."
- **Strategy:** Normalize iteration: "Professional designers create 10+ drafts before finalizing. Today is draft 1—exactly where you should be. Sharing helps everyone learn from different approaches. Your willingness to share helps your classmates." Frame class sharing as collaborative learning, not evaluation.

### Data Visualization Familiarity
- **Consideration:** Some Vietnamese students may have limited exposure to data visualization best practices (common in education system emphasizing text over visuals).
- **Strategy:** Provide extra examples during introduction. Show 3 good chart examples (bar, line, pie) and explain when to use each. Offer chart selection decision tree on whiteboard. Encourage questions about basics—no shame in asking "Which chart shows comparison best?"

## Extension Activities (If Time Allows)

### Activity 1: Peer Audit (Extra 10 min)
- After individual work, students swap decks with a partner
- Partner applies 1-minute audit: Can I identify the main point of each slide in under 5 seconds?
- If not, partner suggests ONE focus technique improvement
- Designer revises based on feedback

### Activity 2: Before/After Comparison (Extra 10 min)
- Show a "before" version of a plastic waste slide (cluttered, chartjunk, no focus)
- Class calls out principle violations
- Students sketch quick "after" version applying principles
- Compare student solutions—see multiple valid approaches

### Activity 3: Real Executive Slide Deck Analysis (Extra 15 min)
- Show 3 slides from real Vietnamese or international corporate presentations (anonymized)
- Class identifies what works well (principles applied) and what could improve
- Connects lecture to real-world examples
- Builds critical evaluation skills for Week 12 preparation

## Wrap-Up Script (Final 2 Minutes)

"Excellent work today designing persuasive slide decks using research frameworks. Three key takeaways for Week 12 Group Presentation:

1. **Start with your message, then design**—Don't ask 'What chart should I use?' Ask 'What do I want my audience to see?' then choose the chart that tells that story. Form follows function.

2. **Apply the focus technique every time**—Decluttering alone doesn't help comprehension. You need headline stating conclusion + strategic color highlighting key data. This 2.5x improvement is worth the effort.

3. **Use speaker notes for details**—Your 3 slides today had minimal text because YOU provided explanation verbally. Same principle for Week 12: slides show keywords/visuals, you explain. This solves redundancy problem and keeps audience listening to you, not reading ahead.

**Before you leave:**
- Complete Week 6 quiz by Sunday (covers today's principles)
- Pre-read Cialdini Chapters 1-3 for next week on persuasive storytelling
- **Reminder:** Persuasive Proposal (15% of grade) due Week 7—this tutorial's persuasive structure applies to your written proposal too

Keep your 3-slide deck—you'll reference it when building Week 12 presentation. See you next week!"
