# Week 10 Tutorial: Tutor Notes

**Course:** BCI2AU Business Communication
**Week:** 10 - Integration & Capstone
**Activity:** Group Presentation Dress Rehearsal

---

## Session Timing

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Quick Review | 5 min | Lecture recap + rubric criteria overview |
| Presentation Set-Up | 5 min | Technical checks, space allocation, feedback template distribution |
| Full Dress Rehearsals | 65 min | 2-3 teams present (15 min presentation + 10 min Q&A + 5 min feedback per team) |
| Class Debrief | 10 min | Each presenting team shares one strength/one improvement; tutor synthesis |
| Before Next Class | 5 min | Remind Executive Summary deadline + Week 10 quiz |

**Total:** 90 minutes

**Presentation Order:** Determine before tutorial begins. Options:
- Random selection on the day (keeps all teams prepared)
- Volunteer order (rewards proactive teams)
- Alphabetical rotation (fair and predictable)

**If time short:** Reduce immediate feedback discussion from 5 minutes to 3 minutes per team. Priority is full 15-minute presentation + 10-minute Q&A—these are non-negotiable for realistic practice.

- Timer/clock visible to presenting team
- Backup laptop/connection cables available

**Logistics to confirm:**
- All teams have access to slides (USB drives, cloud links, email backups)
- Presentation technology tested before tutorial starts
- Feedback templates printed or accessible digitally
- Timing device ready (phone stopwatch, classroom clock, timer app)

### Materials Needed

- Peer Feedback Template (printed or digital—1 per team per presenting team)
- Timing device visible to all
- Whiteboard/flipchart for noting patterns during debrief
- Copy of Presentation Rubric from Assessment Handbook (for reference)

---

## Critical Tutorial Objectives

This tutorial has ONE primary goal: **Give teams realistic dress rehearsal experience under pressure before their graded Week 12 performance.**

**Why this matters:**
- First full run-through for most teams
- Timing is strict (15 minutes)—teams need to practice hitting exact time
- Q&A under pressure is different from Q&A with teammates
- Peer feedback using rubric criteria helps teams calibrate quality expectations

**Success indicators:**
1. Presenting teams deliver complete 15-minute presentations (not outlines or partial run-throughs)
2. Q&A generates authentic questions that test knowledge depth
3. Peer feedback is specific, rubric-based, and constructive
4. All teams leave knowing exactly what to improve before Week 12

---

## Phase-by-Phase Facilitation Guide

### Phase 1: Presentation Set-Up (5 minutes)

**Facilitation steps:**

1. **Announce presenting order** (if not pre-announced):
   - "Today we'll hear from [Team A], [Team B], and [Team C] in that order"
   - Confirm all presenting teams are ready with slides loaded

2. **Distribute Peer Feedback Templates:**
   - All non-presenting teams receive templates for each presenting team
   - Clarify: "You're evaluating based on actual rubric criteria—this is practice for what instructors will assess in Week 12"

3. **Set expectations:**
   - "This is full dress rehearsal—deliver exactly as you will in Week 12"
   - "Timing is strict: 15 minutes for presentation, then 10 minutes Q&A"
   - "Audience: Ask authentic questions during Q&A—test their knowledge and composure"

4. **Technical check:**
   - First presenting team connects slides, confirms audio/video if needed
   - Timer ready and visible

**Common issues at this stage:**

*Team's slides won't load:*
- Have backup plan: Present from another laptop, use printouts, or present last after troubleshooting

*Team says "we're not ready to present full version":*
- Response: "This is Week 10—full dress rehearsal is the expectation. Present what you have; feedback will help you improve before Week 12."

---

### Phase 2: Full Dress Rehearsals (65 minutes)

**Per-team structure: 30 minutes total**
- 15 minutes: Presentation (timed strictly)
- 10 minutes: Q&A
- 5 minutes: Immediate feedback discussion

**Tutor Role During Presentations:**

**DO:**
- Time strictly—announce "1 minute remaining" at 14:00 mark
- Take notes on patterns (for debrief): strong framework integration, weak transitions, excellent Q&A responses, etc.
- Observe peer feedback quality—are evaluators being specific or generic?
- Note individual contributions (helpful for Individual Presentation Grade assessment in Week 12)

**DON'T:**
- Interrupt during presentation (unless major technical failure)
- Provide your own feedback during immediate feedback discussion—let peers lead
- Allow teams to exceed 15 minutes—stop them firmly at 15:00 (this teaches timing discipline)

**Managing Q&A (10 minutes):**

1. **Open to audience:** "Peer teams, you have 10 minutes to ask questions. Treat this like Week 12—ask about content, frameworks, decisions, evidence."

2. **If no questions immediately:**
   - Prompt: "What about their framework application? Their stakeholder analysis? Their recommendations?"
   - Seed questions if needed: "Team A, can you explain why you chose Pyramid Principle over SCQA structure?"

3. **Distribute questions:**
   - Encourage multiple questioners: "Let's hear from another team"
   - Ensure all presenting team members get questions: "Can another team member respond to this one?"

4. **Watch for reflection-in-action:**
   - Note when presenters adjust answers based on questioner's framing
   - Note when team members support each other during tough questions
   - These observations inform Individual Presentation Grade

**Immediate Feedback Discussion (5 minutes):**

1. **Ask evaluating teams to share:**
   - "What was one strength you identified?" (positive first)
   - "What's one area to develop before Week 12?" (constructive second)

2. **Presenting team responds:**
   - "What surprised you about the feedback?"
   - "Which area will you prioritize improving?"

3. **Keep it brief:**
   - This is quick check-in, not deep discussion
   - Full written feedback captured in templates

**Managing Time Across Multiple Presentations:**

With 65 minutes for rehearsals:
- **2 teams:** 30 minutes each = 60 minutes (5 minutes buffer)
- **3 teams:** ~21 minutes each = 63 minutes (tight but doable if efficient)
  - Option: Reduce immediate feedback to 3 minutes per team

**Transition between teams:**
- Next team connects slides during feedback discussion of previous team
- Minimize downtime between presentations

---

### Phase 3: Class Debrief (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Synthesize patterns, celebrate strengths, identify common development areas, remind about Week 12 logistics.

**Facilitation structure:**

1. **Presenting teams share (5 minutes):**
   - Each presenting team: "What's one strength multiple evaluators identified? What's one critical improvement you're prioritizing?"
   - Keep to 90 seconds per team maximum

2. **Non-presenting teams reflect (2 minutes):**
   - "What was the most common strength you saw across presentations?"
   - "What was the most common development area?"

3. **Tutor synthesis (3 minutes):**
   - Highlight patterns observed: "I noticed all teams had strong content but varied in delivery confidence"
   - Emphasize what distinguishes Excellent from Good: "The difference between Good and Excellent in Q&A is depth of knowledge—not just answering but demonstrating expertise"
   - Practical reminders: "Week 12 timing is strict—if you went over today, practice cutting content, not speeding up delivery"
   - Final encouragement: "You have two weeks to incorporate feedback. Teams that revise based on today's input will see significant improvement."

**Discussion prompts if time allows:**

*"What did you learn about your own presentation by watching others?"*
- Encourages reflection-on-action (Schön framework from lecture)
- Students often realize strengths/gaps by comparison

*"How did Q&A feel different from practicing with your team?"*
- Highlights value of external questioning
- Reinforces need to prepare for unpredictable questions

*"What's one thing you'll do differently in Week 12 based on today?"*
- Concrete action planning
- Connects today's practice to future performance

## Common Student Approaches (Valid Variations)

### Approach 1: Highly Polished Presentation (Over-Prepared)

**Characteristics:**
- Team has memorized entire script
- Slides are finalized and professional
- Presentation flows smoothly but may feel rehearsed/stiff

**Why this is valid:**
- Shows strong preparation and commitment
- Content and visuals likely strong (rubric Content & Visual Design criteria)

**Potential weaknesses:**
- May struggle with Q&A if they've only practiced scripted content
- Transitions may feel mechanical rather than natural
- Risk of losing authenticity/engagement

**Tutor guidance:**
- Affirm preparation: "Your polish and professionalism are excellent"
- Address authenticity: "In Week 12, find ways to sound conversational even with prepared content—eye contact, natural pacing, reacting to audience"
- Q&A coaching: "Your content knowledge is strong—trust yourselves to speak naturally during Q&A rather than searching for 'right' answers"

---

### Approach 2: Loosely Structured Presentation (Under-Prepared)

**Characteristics:**
- Team has rough slides or uses bullet-heavy slides as notes
- Content is there but delivery feels improvisational
- Timing may run short or long due to lack of rehearsal

**Why this might happen:**
- Team is still developing content
- Over-confidence in ability to present without practice
- Prioritized content over delivery preparation

**Potential weaknesses:**
- Likely struggles with timing (rubric Team Coordination criterion)
- Transitions may be awkward or missing
- Delivery lacks polish (rubric Delivery & Presence criterion)

**Tutor guidance:**
- Acknowledge content: "Your ideas and framework application are solid"
- Address preparation gap: "Week 12 requires polish—practice full run-throughs to internalize timing and transitions"
- Practical advice: "Script your transitions between speakers. Practice your opening and closing until they're smooth. Aim for 'well-rehearsed' not 'improvised.'"

---

### Approach 3: Unbalanced Team Participation

**Characteristics:**
- One or two members dominate speaking time
- Some members barely speak or only present minor sections
- May indicate team dynamics issues or unequal preparation

**Why this happens:**
- Stronger speakers volunteered for more content
- Weaker speakers avoided presenting major sections
- Team didn't explicitly plan for balance

**Potential weaknesses:**
- Violates rubric Team Coordination criterion (equal participation required)
- Affects Individual Presentation Grades significantly
- May indicate collaboration issues

**Tutor guidance (address tactfully during feedback):**
- Neutral observation: "I noticed speaking time wasn't evenly distributed—this will impact your Team Coordination score"
- Practical solution: "Aim for ±1 minute per team member. Redistribute sections if needed to balance workload"
- Individual responsibility: "Your Individual Presentation Grade depends on your personal performance—all members need substantial speaking roles"

---

### Approach 4: Strong Content, Weak Delivery

**Characteristics:**
- Excellent framework application and analysis
- Poor delivery: reading from slides, monotone, no eye contact, nervous mannerisms

**Why this happens:**
- Team prioritized content development over delivery practice
- Presentation anxiety
- Lack of individual practice outside team rehearsals

**Potential strengths:**
- Content & Analysis rubric criterion likely strong
- Good foundation to build on

**Potential weaknesses:**
- Delivery & Presence rubric criterion will suffer
- May lose audience engagement despite strong content

**Tutor guidance:**
- Affirm content strength: "Your framework integration and analysis are sophisticated—that's excellent"
- Address delivery gap: "Week 12 success requires confident delivery. Practice individually: record yourself, practice with friends, rehearse until content feels automatic"
- Practical tips: "Don't read slides—slides are for audience, your words add value. Practice looking at audience, not screen. Slow down—nervous presenters rush."

---

### Approach 5: Excellent Integration (Gold Standard)

**Characteristics:**
- Strong content with sophisticated framework integration
- Confident, engaging delivery with natural pacing
- Professional slides with clear visual hierarchy
- Seamless team coordination
- Handles Q&A with depth and composure

**Why this works:**
- Team has balanced content preparation with delivery practice
- Clear evidence of rehearsal and feedback incorporation
- Strong collaboration and individual preparation

**What to affirm:**
- "This is Excellent-level work. Your strategic integration is evident, delivery is polished, and team coordination is seamless."
- "In Week 12, maintain this quality. Consider: Where can you go even deeper? What questions might challenge your arguments?"

---

## Common Student Misconceptions to Address

### Misconception 1: "Dress rehearsal means we can present partial content"

**What students think:** Today is for testing ideas, not full performance.

**Why this is wrong:** Dress rehearsal means complete run-through. Partial presentations don't test timing, transitions, or stamina.

**How to address:**
- Set expectation early: "Dress rehearsal means full performance, opening to closing, exactly as Week 12"
- If team tries to skip sections: "Please deliver the full presentation. If sections are rough, that's fine—feedback will help you improve."

---

### Misconception 2: "15 minutes is approximate"

**What students think:** "Around 15 minutes" is acceptable—13 minutes or 17 minutes is close enough.

**Why this is wrong:** Assessment Handbook states "±1 minute; penalties for over/under." Timing discipline is professional skill.

**How to address:**
- Enforce strictly today: Stop presentations at 15:00 mark
- Explain: "In Week 12, going over time results in penalties. Going under suggests insufficient content. Practice hitting exactly 15 minutes."
- Practical advice: "If you're consistently over, cut content—don't speed up delivery. If you're under, add examples or depth—don't add filler."

---

### Misconception 3: "Peer feedback is less valuable than instructor feedback"

**What students think:** Only instructor feedback matters for improvement.

**Why this is wrong:** Peers are your audience—their reactions indicate what works and what doesn't. Multiple perspectives reveal patterns.

**How to address:**
- Value peer feedback: "Your classmates are your target audience—if they're confused or disengaged, Week 12 audience will be too"
- Multiple evaluators: "If three teams say your transitions are awkward, that's a pattern to address"
- Instructor synthesis: "I'm watching for patterns peer evaluators identify—that's what I'll highlight in debrief"

---

### Misconception 4: "Q&A is separate from presentation quality"

**What students think:** As long as presentation goes well, Q&A is just bonus.

**Why this is wrong:** Q&A is 15% of rubric. It tests depth of knowledge and composure under pressure.

**How to address:**
- Emphasize weight: "Q&A Performance is 15% of your grade—same weight as Visual Design or Team Coordination"
- What it assesses: "Q&A reveals whether you deeply understand your topic or just memorized slides"
- Preparation strategy: "Anticipate 10 likely questions. Practice answering without notes. Prepare to defend your framework choices and recommendations."

---

### Misconception 5: "Individual grade is just speaking time divided by team"

**What students think:** If everyone speaks equal time, everyone gets same Individual Presentation Grade.

**Why this is wrong:** Individual grade assesses personal delivery quality, Q&A handling, and peer evaluation of contribution.

**How to address:**
- Clarify components: "Individual grade includes: your personal delivery (voice, presence, confidence), how you handle Q&A questions, and peer evaluation of your contribution"
- Quality over quantity: "It's not just speaking time—it's how effectively you communicate during your time"
- Individual preparation: "Even in team presentation, your individual polish matters. Practice your sections until confident."

---

## Cultural Considerations (Vietnamese Context)

### Collectivism and Team Harmony

**Cultural factor:** Vietnamese students prioritize group harmony; may avoid giving critical feedback to maintain relationships.

**Implication:** Peer feedback may be overly positive, avoiding specific development areas.

**Adaptation:**
- Frame feedback as helping: "Best teams give each other honest feedback—that's how you help each other succeed in Week 12"
- Use structured template: Rubric-based template depersonalizes critique—not personal opinion, but assessment criteria
- Model constructive feedback: During debrief, demonstrate specific, kind feedback: "Strong content, and one area to develop is delivery confidence—practice individually to build comfort"

---

### High Power Distance and Authority

**Cultural factor:** Students may defer to instructor authority; hesitant to evaluate peers who may be older or higher status.

**Implication:** Some students may feel uncomfortable "judging" classmates.

**Adaptation:**
- Authorize peer feedback: "You're not judging—you're using rubric criteria to help teammates improve. This is professional skill."
- Emphasize reciprocity: "Everyone receives feedback today. You're helping each other prepare for success."
- Instructor validation: Circulate and affirm good peer feedback when you hear it: "That's excellent feedback—very specific and helpful"

---

### Indirect Communication Norms

**Cultural factor:** Vietnamese communication tends toward indirectness; students may soften criticism excessively.

**Implication:** Feedback may be too vague to be actionable.

**Adaptation:**
- Provide sentence stems for directness:
  - "One strength is..."
  - "One area to develop before Week 12 is..."
  - "I was confused when..."
  - "I would have liked to see more..."
- Emphasize specificity: "Instead of 'good job,' say 'your opening hook was engaging because...'"

---

### Presentation Anxiety

**Cultural factor:** Many Vietnamese students have limited experience with oral presentations and high anxiety about public speaking.

**Implication:** Some students may be visibly nervous during dress rehearsal; teams may request to go last or skip.

**Adaptation:**
- Normalize anxiety: "Dress rehearsals often feel more nerve-wracking than actual performance—this is practice to build confidence"
- Emphasize value: "The more you practice under pressure, the more comfortable you'll be in Week 12"
- Low-stakes framing: "Today's feedback is for learning, not grading. Use this opportunity to make mistakes and improve."

---

### Face-Saving and Mistake Avoidance

**Cultural factor:** Strong concern about "losing face" by making errors in front of peers.

**Implication:** Teams may be reluctant to present if they feel unprepared; may avoid answering difficult Q&A questions.

**Adaptation:**
- Reframe mistakes: "Dress rehearsals are for finding what needs improvement—that's the purpose. Better to discover gaps now than in Week 12."
- Instructor vulnerability: "When I prepare presentations, I always practice in front of others—I've made countless mistakes in rehearsals. That's how I improve."
- Private option: If student is extremely anxious, offer brief individual coaching after tutorial rather than forcing public presentation

---

## Assessment Connection and Grading Context

### How Today Connects to Week 12 Graded Assessment

**Group Presentation (25%):**
- Today's dress rehearsal is final practice before graded performance
- Peer feedback today identifies specific areas to improve
- Teams that incorporate feedback see measurable improvement in Week 12 scores

**Individual Presentation Grade (15%):**
- Tutor observations today inform Week 12 Individual Grade assessment
- Students demonstrating strong individual delivery today show capacity for excellence
- Students with weak individual delivery today should prioritize individual practice before Week 12

**Participation (10%):**
- Today's tutorial participation counts toward overall participation grade
- Non-presenting teams must complete feedback templates (checked)
- Presenting teams must deliver complete presentations (not partial)

---

### What Tutor Should Note for Week 12 Assessment

**During today's dress rehearsals, observe and note:**

1. **Individual capabilities:**
   - Which students demonstrate strong delivery (voice, presence, confidence)?
   - Which students struggle with delivery and need improvement?
   - Who handles Q&A well vs. who appears unprepared?

2. **Team dynamics:**
   - Is participation balanced across team members?
   - How do teams handle transitions?
   - Do team members support each other during Q&A or leave individuals struggling?

3. **Content quality:**
   - Which teams demonstrate sophisticated framework integration (Level 3)?
   - Which teams show surface-level application (Level 1-2)?
   - Is evidence compelling or generic?

**These observations help calibrate expectations for Week 12 and identify students who may need additional coaching.**

---

## Contingency Plans

### If No Team Is Ready to Present Full Version

**Scenario:** All teams claim they're not ready for full dress rehearsal.

**Response:**
- Firm expectation: "Week 12 is in two weeks. You need practice now. Present what you have—feedback will help you improve."
- Adjust structure: "Present your strongest sections in sequence. We'll focus feedback on what you deliver."
- Minimum requirement: "At minimum, deliver opening, one body section, closing. That's enough to practice timing and get feedback."

---

### If Presentations Run Significantly Over Time

**Scenario:** Teams present for 18-20 minutes instead of 15.

**Response:**
- Stop at 15:00 mark: "Time's up—we need to stop here for Q&A"
- Debrief explicitly: "In Week 12, instructors will stop you at 15 minutes and penalties apply. Practice cutting content to fit time."
- Coaching: "If you're over, don't speed up—cut content. Prioritize what's most important."

---

### If Q&A Produces No Questions

**Scenario:** Peer teams don't ask questions during Q&A period.

**Response:**
- Seed questions: "Let me start—Team A, can you explain why you chose this framework over alternatives?"
- Direct to peer teams: "Evaluating teams, imagine you're a stakeholder—what would you challenge or ask about?"
- Provide question types: "Ask about their evidence sources, framework choices, recommendations, or alternative approaches"

---

### If Peer Feedback Is Too Generic

**Scenario:** Evaluators write "good job" or "nice slides" without specifics.

**Response:**
- Intervene during feedback discussion: "Let's be more specific—what exactly made their opening effective?"
- Refer to rubric: "Use the five rubric criteria. For Content & Analysis, what framework application did you observe?"
- Model specificity: "I observed strong Pyramid Principle structure—they led with recommendation, then supporting points. That's specific, actionable feedback."

---

### If Technical Issues Consume Too Much Time

**Scenario:** Slides won't load, projector fails, laptop crashes.

**Response:**
- Move problem team to end of order
- Have backup plan: "Present using printed slides or present from another laptop"
- If unsolvable: "Team will present in instructor office hours for feedback"

---

## Success Indicators for This Tutorial

**By end of session, successful outcomes include:**

1. **2-3 teams completed full 15-minute presentations + 10-minute Q&A**
2. **All evaluating teams provided specific, rubric-based feedback**
3. **All presenting teams identified at least one critical improvement area**
4. **All teams understand timing expectations and have practiced full performance**
5. **Students leave with concrete action plans for Week 12 preparation**

**Red flags requiring follow-up:**
- Team unable to present 15 minutes of content (too little prepared)
- Team significantly over 15 minutes with no awareness of issue
- Feedback is entirely generic with no specific observations
