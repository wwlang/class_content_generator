// Week 10: Integration & Capstone
// Quiz covering Kolb, Schön, MIT Sloan, and McKinsey frameworks

// Question W10-Q1-kolb-components
::W10-Q1-kolb-components:: What are the four stages of Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle? {
  =Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, Active Experimentation # Correct! These four stages form the complete learning cycle that Kolb identified.
  ~Content Exposure, Reflection, Conceptual Learning, Practice Application # Incorrect. While similar, these are not the exact terms Kolb used for the four stages.
  ~Experience, Analysis, Understanding, Implementation # Incorrect. These are too general. Kolb's specific terminology includes 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization.'
  ~Doing, Watching, Thinking, Testing # Incorrect. These are informal descriptions, not Kolb's formal terminology.
  ####Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle has four distinct stages: **Concrete Experience** (direct involvement in an activity), **Reflective Observation** (analyzing what happened from multiple perspectives), **Abstract Conceptualization** (developing theories and understanding), and **Active Experimentation** (testing insights in new situations). These stages create a **cyclical** (repeating, spiral process) progression. See Week 10 slides 5-6.
}

// Question W10-Q2-kolb-learning-styles
::W10-Q2-kolb-learning-styles:: How do Converging and Diverging learning styles differ according to Kolb? {
  =Converging combines Abstract Conceptualization and Active Experimentation; Diverging combines Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation # Correct! These **biphasic** (two-part) combinations determine learning style preferences.
  ~Converging learners prefer lectures; Diverging learners prefer hands-on practice # Incorrect. The distinction is not about preference for lectures vs. practice, but about which two stages they favor.
  ~Converging learners reflect more; Diverging learners experiment more # Incorrect. Converging learners are action and problem-solving oriented; Diverging learners are reflective and imaginative.
  ~Converging learners work alone; Diverging learners work in groups # Incorrect. These learning styles describe how people process experiences, not whether they work alone or collaboratively.
  ####Converging learners combine Abstract Conceptualization (understanding theories) with Active Experimentation (applying solutions), making them strong problem-solvers but sometimes missing emotional dimensions. Diverging learners combine Concrete Experience (doing) and Reflective Observation (analyzing from multiple angles), making them imaginative and creative but sometimes struggling with decisive action. See Week 10 slide 7.

// Question W10-Q3-kolb-definition
::W10-Q3-kolb-definition:: According to Kolb, what does "knowing-in-action" mean? {
  =Skills and knowledge that are embedded in skillful performance but difficult to fully articulate # Correct! This is Kolb's term for **tacit** (unspoken, implied) knowledge developed through experience.
  ~The ability to explain frameworks clearly to others # Incorrect. Knowing-in-action is about skills you can do automatically, not necessarily explain clearly.
  ~The stage where you actively experiment with new theories # Incorrect. Active Experimentation is one stage of the cycle, but knowing-in-action is different.
  ~Learning that happens only through real-world practice, not through study # Incorrect. Knowing-in-action develops through the full cycle including reflection and conceptualization.
  ####**Knowing-in-action** is **tacit** (implicit, not explicitly stated) knowledge—things you've learned so thoroughly they've become automatic. For example, once you've applied Pyramid Principle dozens of times, you structure arguments automatically without conscious thought. This is developed through completing the full learning cycle multiple times. See Week 10 slide 9.
}

// Question W10-Q4-schon-reflection-types
::W10-Q4-schon-reflection-types:: How do reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action differ in timing and purpose? {
  =Reflection-in-action happens during performance for real-time adjustment; reflection-on-action happens after the event for analysis and learning # Correct! These **temporal** (time-based) distinctions determine when each type of reflection occurs.
  ~Reflection-in-action is for identifying problems; reflection-on-action is for solving them # Incorrect. Both types of reflection involve both problem identification and understanding.
  ~Reflection-in-action is solo; reflection-on-action involves discussing with others # Incorrect. The distinction is about when reflection occurs, not whether it's individual or collaborative.
  ~Reflection-in-action applies to presentations; reflection-on-action applies to writing # Incorrect. Both types of reflection apply to all professional communication tasks.
  ####**Reflection-in-action** is real-time thinking during professional tasks—adjusting your presentation delivery when you notice audience confusion, or changing your examples mid-conversation based on listener reactions. **Reflection-on-action** is **retrospective** (looking back), stepping back after an event to analyze what happened and why. Both are essential: one enables immediate adjustment; the other enables deep learning. See Week 10 slides 8-9.
}

// Question W10-Q5-schon-problem-framing
::W10-Q5-schon-problem-framing:: According to Schön, what is problem setting in professional practice? {
  =The process of constructing and framing problems from ambiguous situations, not just solving pre-defined problems # Correct! Problem setting is the expert skill of determining what the actual problem is before solving it.
  ~The ability to identify the correct solution to a given problem # Incorrect. That's problem solving, not problem setting. Problem setting comes first.
  ~Breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable parts # Incorrect. That's problem decomposition, not the process Schön describes as problem setting.
  ~Communicating the problem clearly to team members # Incorrect. Schön focuses on how professionals frame problems from **ambiguous** (unclear, uncertain) situations.
  ####**Problem setting** is the expert's ability to construct what the actual problem is from unclear, troubling situations. Novices receive a problem and solve it; experts must first determine what the real problem actually is. For example: a memo request (surface problem) might really be about stakeholder misalignment (real problem). Schön argues this is how professionals distinguish themselves. See Week 10 slide 10.
}

// Question W10-Q6-schon-knowing-in-action
::W10-Q6-schon-knowing-in-action:: Why does Schön argue that knowing-in-action is essential for professionals? {
  =Because it allows professionals to perform skillfully in complex situations without always consciously thinking through each step # Correct! **Automatic** (happening without conscious thought) performance enables flexibility and real-time **adaptation** (adjustment to circumstances).
  ~Because it means professionals always know the 'right' answer before a problem appears # Incorrect. Knowing-in-action doesn't mean having all answers—it means being able to think quickly and adjust.
  ~Because it eliminates the need for reflection in professional practice # Incorrect. Schön emphasizes that knowing-in-action works alongside both types of reflection.
  ~Because it proves that professionals have completed their training and need no further development # Incorrect. Schön argues professionals continually develop through cycles of reflection and experimentation.
  ####**Knowing-in-action** enables professionals to perform **fluently** (smoothly, with competence) in complex situations. Because some knowledge is **tacit** (unspoken, built through experience), experts can adjust to unexpected situations in real-time. Without this **automatic** performance at the foundation, professionals couldn't engage in the **nimble** (quick, flexible) thinking needed for reflection-in-action. See Week 10 slides 8-9.

// Question W10-Q7-mit-sloan-strategies
::W10-Q7-mit-sloan-strategies:: What are the four strategies for building continuous learning capability according to MIT Sloan research? {
  =Link Purpose to Learning, Create Learning-Rich Experiences, Ask Meta-Learning Questions, Nurture a Learning Team # Correct! These four **evidence-based** (supported by research data) strategies drive learning agility.
  ~Set Career Goals, Take Online Courses, Read Business Books, Find a Mentor # Incorrect. While these are helpful, they're not the specific four strategies MIT Sloan identified.
  ~Identify Skill Gaps, Practice Deliberately, Measure Progress, Celebrate Success # Incorrect. These are general learning principles, not the four MIT Sloan strategies.
  ~Join Professional Associations, Attend Conferences, Network with Peers, Seek Promotions # Incorrect. While these support development, they're not the MIT Sloan framework.
  ####MIT Sloan's research with 340 professionals identified four **empirically validated** (proven through research) strategies: **Purpose linkage** (connecting learning to personal goals), **experiential variety** (seeking diverse and challenging tasks), **reflective questioning** (systematically asking what you need to learn), and **social support** (finding feedback partners and mentors). These strategies accelerate skill development more than isolated practice. See Week 10 slide 13.
}

// Question W10-Q8-mit-sloan-meta-learning
::W10-Q8-mit-sloan-meta-learning:: How does asking meta-learning questions support continuous skill development? {
  =They help learners assess what they need, how to learn it, and where gaps exist—creating a focused development plan # Correct! **Metacognitive** (thinking about thinking) questions direct learning efforts **strategically** (according to a plan).
  ~They encourage learners to memorize more information quickly # Incorrect. Meta-learning questions are about self-assessment and planning, not speed of memorization.
  ~They replace the need for feedback from others # Incorrect. Meta-learning questions are one strategy; they work alongside feedback from mentors and peers.
  ~They guarantee that learners will master all professional skills # Incorrect. Meta-learning questions support development but don't guarantee mastery—consistent practice is still required.
  ####**Metacognitive** questions (What do I need to learn? How should I learn it? Where are my gaps?) force learners to become **intentional** (deliberate, purposeful) about their development rather than passive. These questions connect directly to Kolb's framework—identifying learning style preferences and targeting specific growth areas. MIT Sloan found that professionals who ask these questions **systematically** (according to a structured process) develop faster. See Week 10 slide 13.
}

// Question W10-Q9-mit-sloan-purpose
::W10-Q9-mit-sloan-purpose:: Why does linking purpose to learning accelerate skill acquisition in MIT Sloan research? {
  =Understanding why a skill matters for your career goals increases motivation and engagement with learning # Correct! **Intrinsic motivation** (internal desire based on personal values) drives deeper and faster skill development.
  ~It allows learners to skip difficult material that doesn't relate to their goals # Incorrect. Purpose linkage doesn't mean avoiding challenging material—it means seeing why it matters.
  ~It reduces the total amount of learning required for competence # Incorrect. Purpose linkage doesn't reduce learning requirements—it increases motivation to complete full learning.
  ~It makes skills easier to learn because they're more interesting # Incorrect. While interest helps, the mechanism is deeper—purpose creates **psychological commitment** (emotional buy-in).
  ####MIT Sloan's regression analysis shows that when learners connect skill development to personal career aspirations, they develop **accelerated** (faster) competence. This works because **intrinsic motivation** (internal drive based on personal goals) produces deeper engagement than **extrinsic motivation** (external rewards). For example: "I want to lead international teams, so cross-cultural communication mastery is essential for my career" creates stronger learning than "I need to pass this course." See Week 10 slide 13.

// Question W10-Q10-mckinsey-versatility-dimensions
::W10-Q10-mckinsey-versatility-dimensions:: What are the three dimensions of professional versatility in the McKinsey framework? {
  =Pursue Diverse Experiences, Go Deep (Constant Curiosity), Know When to Speak Up # Correct! These three **complementary** (working together) dimensions create professional versatility.
  ~Technical Skills, Communication Skills, Leadership Skills # Incorrect. The McKinsey framework doesn't divide versatility into these three skill categories.
  ~Individual Performance, Team Collaboration, Strategic Thinking # Incorrect. While important, these aren't the three McKinsey dimensions specifically.
  ~Breadth of Knowledge, Speed of Learning, Excellence of Execution # Incorrect. The McKinsey framework uses different terminology focusing on experience types and depth.
  ####McKinsey's research with global executives identified three dimensions that distinguish versatile leaders: seeking **diverse** (varied, different) experiences to avoid becoming narrow, pursuing **depth** alongside breadth through **rigorous analysis** (thorough, systematic examination), and speaking up **authentically** (genuinely, truthfully) only when you have real expertise. These three work together: breadth prevents narrow expertise; depth prevents shallow generalization; authentic voice prevents empty rhetoric. See Week 10 slide 14.
}

// Question W10-Q11-mckinsey-diverse-experiences
::W10-Q11-mckinsey-diverse-experiences:: How do diverse experiences contribute to professional versatility according to McKinsey? {
  =They develop multiple communication modes and prevent narrow specialization, enabling adaptation across different contexts # Correct! **Polymathic** (many-sided, knowledgeable in multiple areas) professionals adapt better to varied situations.
  ~They prove to employers that you can work in any industry or role # Incorrect. Diverse experiences don't mean you can do everything—they develop **flexibility** (ability to adjust) within your expertise.
  ~They allow professionals to avoid developing deep expertise in any single area # Incorrect. McKinsey emphasizes both breadth AND depth—diverse experiences work alongside specialization.
  ~They guarantee career advancement and higher salary # Incorrect. Diverse experiences support versatility and adaptability but don't guarantee career outcomes.
  ####McKinsey's research shows that versatile professionals deliberately seek varied communication challenges—different audiences, formats, industries—to develop **adaptive capacity** (ability to adjust skills to new situations). This prevents becoming a "one-note" communicator skilled in only one style. For example, practicing both analytical presentations and persuasive pitches develops broader capability than specializing in only analytics. The key is **intentional variety**—choosing experiences that stretch different communication muscles. See Week 10 slide 14.
}

// Question W10-Q12-mckinsey-authenticity
::W10-Q12-mckinsey-authenticity:: What does McKinsey mean by "know when to speak up" as part of professional versatility? {
  =Communicate on topics where you have genuine expertise rather than speaking just to be heard or without substance # Correct! This avoids the **'empty suit'** (appearance of authority without real knowledge) syndrome.
  ~Always speak up in meetings to show confidence and engagement # Incorrect. Speaking constantly doesn't demonstrate versatility—it can suggest insecurity or lack of focus.
  ~Be willing to disagree with senior leaders to show independent thinking # Incorrect. While healthy disagreement matters, the McKinsey principle is about authentic expertise, not contrarianism.
  ~Speak up only when directly asked a question by leadership # Incorrect. The principle isn't about waiting for permission—it's about contributing **substantively** (meaningfully, with real content).
  ####McKinsey emphasizes that versatile leaders communicate **authentically**—contributing when they have real knowledge or stake in outcomes, not just to be heard. This avoids the **'empty suit'** problem: appearing authoritative while lacking substance. The practice requires **epistemic humility** (acknowledging the limits of what you know) and **authentic leadership** (communicating based on genuine expertise). A versatile communicator might be silent on technical topics outside their expertise but vocal on strategy, because they have genuine insight to offer. See Week 10 slide 14.
