// Q1: Kolb's Learning Cycle Stages (Remembering)
::Q1 Kolb's Learning Cycle Stages::What are the four stages of Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle in the correct sequence?{
~Concrete Experience → Abstract Conceptualization → Reflective Observation → Active Experimentation#While this includes all four stages, the sequence is wrong. Reflective Observation comes before Abstract Conceptualization, not after.
=Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation#Correct! Kolb's cycle progresses through\: Concrete Experience (doing), Reflective Observation (reviewing), Abstract Conceptualization (concluding), and Active Experimentation (planning).
~Reflective Observation → Concrete Experience → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation#The cycle typically begins with Concrete Experience (the doing phase), though learners can enter at any point. The sequence here is also incorrect.
~Active Experimentation → Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization#This reverses the natural progression of the learning cycle. Active Experimentation (testing theories) comes after you've developed those theories through the other three stages.

// Q2: Reflection-in-Action Definition (Remembering)
::Q2 Reflection-in-Action Definition::According to Schön, what is "reflection-in-action"?{
~Retrospective analysis of professional experiences after an event#This describes "reflection-on-action," which is the retrospective analysis that happens after an event, not during it.
=Real-time thinking and adjusting approaches while performing professional tasks#Correct! Reflection-in-action is the "thinking on your feet" that occurs in real-time during professional performance, such as adjusting a presentation based on audience cues.
~Planning and preparation before beginning a professional task#This describes preparatory planning, not reflection-in-action. Schön's concept involves monitoring and adjusting during the performance itself.
~Documenting lessons learned for future reference#This is part of reflection-on-action (retrospective analysis), not the real-time adjustment that characterizes reflection-in-action.

// Q3: Learning Style Identification (Remembering - Matching)
::Q3 Learning Style - Diverging::Which characteristic strength corresponds to the Diverging (CE/RO) learning style?{
~Finding practical uses for theories and making decisions#This describes Converging learners (AC/AE) who focus on practical application.
=Viewing from multiple perspectives and brainstorming#Correct! Diverging learners excel at viewing situations from multiple angles and generating creative solutions through brainstorming.
~Getting things done and adapting to circumstances#This describes Accommodating learners (CE/AE) who are action-oriented.
~Understanding wide-ranging information and creating models#This describes Assimilating learners (AC/RO) who are strong at synthesizing complex information.
}

::Q3 Learning Style - Assimilating::Which characteristic strength corresponds to the Assimilating (AC/RO) learning style?{
~Finding practical uses for theories and making decisions#This describes Converging learners (AC/AE) who focus on practical application.
~Viewing from multiple perspectives and brainstorming#This describes Diverging learners (CE/RO) who excel at creative problem-solving.
~Getting things done and adapting to circumstances#This describes Accommodating learners (CE/AE) who are action-oriented.
=Understanding wide-ranging information and creating models#Correct! Assimilating learners are strong at synthesizing complex information and developing theoretical models.
}

::Q3 Learning Style - Converging::Which characteristic strength corresponds to the Converging (AC/AE) learning style?{
=Finding practical uses for theories and making decisions#Correct! Converging learners focus on practical application, finding uses for theories, and problem-solving.
~Viewing from multiple perspectives and brainstorming#This describes Diverging learners (CE/RO) who excel at creative problem-solving.
~Getting things done and adapting to circumstances#This describes Accommodating learners (CE/AE) who are action-oriented.
~Understanding wide-ranging information and creating models#This describes Assimilating learners (AC/RO) who are strong at synthesizing complex information.
}

::Q3 Learning Style - Accommodating::Which characteristic strength corresponds to the Accommodating (CE/AE) learning style?{
~Finding practical uses for theories and making decisions#This describes Converging learners (AC/AE) who focus on practical application.
~Viewing from multiple perspectives and brainstorming#This describes Diverging learners (CE/RO) who excel at creative problem-solving.
=Getting things done and adapting to circumstances#Correct! Accommodating learners are action-oriented, preferring to jump in, learn by doing, and adapt quickly to circumstances.
~Understanding wide-ranging information and creating models#This describes Assimilating learners (AC/RO) who are strong at synthesizing complex information.

// Q4: Schön's Knowing-in-Action (Remembering)
::Q4 Schön's Knowing-in-Action::In Schön's framework, what is "knowing-in-action"?{
~The deliberate practice of reflecting after completing a task#This describes reflection-on-action, not knowing-in-action. Knowing-in-action is about automatic competence, not deliberate reflection.
=Tacit knowledge embedded in skillful performance that you know but can't fully articulate#Correct! Knowing-in-action is Schön's term for tacit knowledge—things you've learned so well they become automatic and you perform them without conscious thought (e.g., "we know more than we can tell").
~Written documentation of best practices and procedures#Knowing-in-action is tacit (unarticulated) knowledge, not explicit documentation. It's the opposite of written procedures.
~The process of adjusting your approach during a presentation#This describes reflection-in-action (real-time adjustment), not knowing-in-action (automatic competence).

// Q5: MIT Sloan Learning Strategies (Remembering)
::Q5 MIT Sloan Learning Strategies::Which of the following is NOT one of the four strategies for learning agility identified in the MIT Sloan research?{
~Link purpose to learning#"Link purpose to learning" is Strategy 1—connecting skill development to career aspirations to accelerate acquisition.
~Create learning-rich experiences#"Create learning-rich experiences" is Strategy 2—deliberately seeking varied and challenging communication tasks.
=Avoid difficult tasks until skills are mastered#Correct! This is the opposite of the MIT Sloan recommendation. Strategy 2 actually encourages seeking challenging tasks and pushing beyond comfort zones deliberately, not avoiding difficult tasks.
~Nurture a learning team#"Nurture a learning team" is Strategy 4—finding feedback partners and mentors for ongoing development.
}

// Q6: Reflection-on-Action Timing (Understanding)
::Q6 Reflection-on-Action Timing::Reflection-on-action occurs during the experience itself, while reflection-in-action happens after the event.{
FALSE#Correct! This statement reverses Schön's definitions. Reflection-in-action occurs during the experience (real-time adjustment), while reflection-on-action happens after the event (retrospective analysis). For example, adjusting your presentation mid-delivery is reflection-in-action; analyzing what worked afterward is reflection-on-action.
}

// Q7: Abstract Conceptualization Purpose (Understanding)
::Q7 Abstract Conceptualization Purpose::Why is "abstract conceptualization" necessary in Kolb's Learning Cycle for learning transfer?{
~It allows you to practice new skills in different contexts#This describes "active experimentation" (testing theories in new situations), not abstract conceptualization. Practicing in different contexts comes after you've developed the theories.
~It helps you receive feedback from multiple perspectives#This describes "reflective observation" (watching and reflecting from multiple perspectives), not abstract conceptualization.
=It enables you to develop theories and principles that can be applied beyond the original situation#Correct! Abstract conceptualization is where you create theories to explain your observations (e.g., "I lose audience when I read slides"). These theories/principles can then be applied to new situations, enabling learning transfer.
~It ensures you have direct hands-on experience with concepts#This describes "concrete experience" (direct involvement), which is the first stage, not abstract conceptualization.
}

// Q8: Problem Setting vs. Problem Solving (Understanding)
::Q8 Problem Setting vs Problem Solving::What is the key difference between problem setting and problem solving according to Schön?{
~Problem setting is faster while problem solving takes more time#Speed is not the distinguishing factor. Problem setting may actually take longer as it involves constructing the problem from ambiguous situations.
=Problem setting involves framing ambiguous situations while problem solving applies techniques to defined problems#Correct! Schön emphasizes that professionals don't just solve given problems—they must first construct problems from "puzzling, troubling, and uncertain" situations. Problem setting is about framing (asking the right question), while problem solving is about finding answers to already-defined problems.
~Problem setting requires more people while problem solving can be done individually#Both can be done individually or collaboratively. The number of people involved is not what distinguishes these concepts.
~Problem setting is for beginners while problem solving is for experts#Actually, Schön argues the opposite—experts engage in problem setting (framing), while novices often only solve problems that are handed to them already defined.

// Q9: McKinsey Versatility Dimensions (Understanding)
::Q9 McKinsey Versatility Dimensions::According to McKinsey's research on professional versatility, going deep (constant curiosity) means avoiding breadth and specializing narrowly in one area.{
FALSE#Correct! McKinsey's versatility framework emphasizes balancing breadth AND depth, not choosing one over the other. Dimension 2 (Go Deep) should be balanced with Dimension 1 (Pursue Diverse Experiences). The framework advocates for "deep-thinking mode" that combines rigorous analysis with decisive action, while also maintaining diverse experiences. Narrow specialization without breadth leads to inflexibility.
}

// Q10: Integration Level Distinction (Understanding)
::Q10 Integration Level Distinction::What distinguishes "strategic integration" (Level 3) from "multiple application" (Level 2) in framework usage?{
~Level 3 uses more frameworks than Level 2#The number of frameworks used is not the key distinction. You could use many frameworks at Level 2 without achieving strategic integration.
~Level 3 uses more complex frameworks than Level 2#Complexity of frameworks doesn't determine the integration level. The distinction is about HOW frameworks are connected, not which ones are used.
=Level 3 shows how frameworks inform each other with clear strategic reasoning, while Level 2 simply uses multiple frameworks side-by-side#Correct! Strategic integration (Level 3) demonstrates that frameworks inform each other—e.g., "Stakeholder analysis revealed X, which led us to choose Y approach, which shaped how we applied Z framework." Multiple application (Level 2) just uses frameworks without showing strategic connections between them.
~Level 3 is only for written work while Level 2 is for presentations#Integration levels apply to both written and oral communication. The medium doesn't determine the level of integration.
