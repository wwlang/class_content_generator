## Segment 1: The Learning Cycle

**How professionals turn experience into expertise**

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle">

## Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

**Four-Stage Continuous Learning Process**

1. **Concrete Experience (CE)** - Do: Engage in new experience
2. **Reflective Observation (RO)** - Review: Observe from multiple perspectives
3. **Abstract Conceptualization (AC)** - Conclude: Create theories to explain
4. **Active Experimentation (AE)** - Plan: Test theories in new situations

**Key Insight:** Learning requires all four stages; can enter anywhere but must complete the cycle

</slide>

<slide number="8" title="Course Journey Through the Cycle">

## Your Communication Journey Through Kolb's Cycle

**Concrete Experience:**
- Tutorial activities, presentation delivery, memo writing
- Portfolio assignments with real-world scenarios

**Reflective Observation:**
- Peer feedback sessions, self-assessment, portfolio review
- Analyzing what worked and what didn't

**Abstract Conceptualization:**
- Frameworks: Pyramid Principle, Cialdini, Hofstede, Executive Presence
- Understanding why certain approaches work

**Active Experimentation:**
- Applying frameworks to new scenarios, portfolio assignments, group work
- Testing new communication strategies

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Four Learning Styles">

## Four Learning Styles (Kolb)

**Based on which stages you prefer:**

- **Diverging (CE/RO):** Imaginative, views from multiple perspectives
  - Strength: Seeing situations from different angles
  - Development need: May struggle with decisive action

- **Assimilating (AC/RO):** Logical, organizing information into frameworks
  - Strength: Creating comprehensive theories
  - Development need: May prefer ideas over practical application

- **Converging (AC/AE):** Problem-solving, finding practical applications
  - Strength: Making decisions and solving problems
  - Development need: May overlook alternative perspectives

- **Accommodating (CE/AE):** Hands-on, action-oriented, intuitive
  - Strength: Getting things done, adaptability
  - Development need: May act without adequate reflection

**No style is "better"—but effective professionals develop flexibility across all modes**

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Identifying Your Learning Preference">

## Identifying Your Learning Preference

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. **Concrete Experience:** Do I learn best by doing and experiencing directly?
2. **Reflective Observation:** Do I learn best by watching and reflecting?
3. **Abstract Conceptualization:** Do I learn best by thinking and analyzing?
4. **Active Experimentation:** Do I learn best by testing and experimenting?

**Most people have two preferred modes**

**Development Strategy:** Identify your weaker modes and deliberately practice them

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Application to Communication Development">

## Applying the Cycle to Your Communication Growth

**Concrete Experience:**
- What communication challenges have you faced this semester?
- Which assignments pushed you outside your comfort zone?

**Reflective Observation:**
- What patterns emerged in your successes and struggles?
- What feedback did you receive consistently?

**Abstract Conceptualization:**
- Which frameworks resonate most with your experiences?
- What communication principles have you internalized?

**Active Experimentation:**
- How will you test these insights in new contexts?
- What communication experiments will you run next?

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2 Intro">

## Segment 2: Reflective Practice

**Turning experience into professional expertise**

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="framework" title="Schön's Reflective Practice">

## Schön's Reflective Practice Model

**Three Modes of Professional Knowledge:**

**Knowing-in-Action:**
- Tacit knowledge embedded in skillful performance
- "The best professionals know more than they can put into words"
- Automatic, intuitive responses developed through experience

**Reflection-in-Action:**
- Real-time thinking while performing (during presentation, mid-conversation)
- Adjusting approach based on immediate feedback
- "Thinking on your feet"

**Reflection-on-Action:**
- Retrospective analysis after the experience
- Examining what worked and why
- Planning improvements for next time

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Reflection in Communication Contexts">

## Reflective Practice in Business Communication

**Knowing-in-Action Examples:**
- Automatically adjusting tone for different audiences
- Intuitively structuring arguments persuasively
- Naturally reading audience cues and body language

**Reflection-in-Action Examples:**
- Noticing audience confusion during presentation → adding an additional example
- Sensing resistance in negotiation → shifting persuasive approach
- Detecting email miscommunication → picking up phone instead

**Reflection-on-Action Examples:**
- Analyzing why memo wasn't persuasive → improving evidence base
- Reviewing presentation feedback → identifying delivery patterns
- Examining failed persuasion attempt → strengthening framework application

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="The Reflective Conversation">

## The "Conversation with the Situation"

**Schön's Key Concept:**
Effective professionals engage in ongoing dialogue with their work, treating problems as dynamic rather than static

**Communication Application:**

**Linear Approach (Weak):**
1. Analyze audience
2. Develop message
3. Deliver communication
4. Done

**Reflective Approach (Strong):**
1. Analyze audience → Notice gaps in understanding
2. Develop message → Test assumptions about what will persuade
3. Deliver communication → Monitor reactions and adjust
4. Reflect on outcomes → Refine approach for next time
5. **Repeat cycle continuously**

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Problem Setting vs Problem Solving">

## Problem Setting vs. Problem Solving

**Schön's Key Insight:**
Effective professionals don't just solve given problems—they construct and frame problems from ambiguous situations

**Communication Application:**

**Weak approach:** "I need to give a presentation" → applies standard template

**Strong approach:** "What communication challenge am I actually facing here?"
- Is this a persuasion problem? (resistance to overcome)
- A knowledge problem? (audience lacks context)
- A relationship problem? (trust needs building)
- A complexity problem? (simplification required)

**Different problem definitions → Different communication strategies**

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="From Novice to Expert">

## The Journey from Novice to Expert Communicator

**Novice:**
- Follows rules and procedures rigidly
- Needs explicit frameworks for every situation
- Reflection happens only when prompted

**Competent:**
- Applies frameworks flexibly
- Recognizes patterns across situations
- Reflects regularly on performance

**Expert:**
- Intuitive responses (knowing-in-action)
- Continuous real-time adjustment (reflection-in-action)
- Systematic learning from experience (reflection-on-action)
- **All three modes operating simultaneously**

**Your goal: Move from novice toward competent and expert practice**

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Self-Assessment Framework">

## Structured Self-Assessment Questions

**Based on Schön's Reflective Practice:**

1. **Knowing-in-Action:** What communication skills have become automatic for me? What do I do intuitively without thinking?

2. **Reflection-in-Action:** When do I adjust my communication in real-time? What cues trigger those adjustments?

3. **Reflection-on-Action:** What patterns have I noticed in my communication successes and challenges across the semester?

4. **Problem Setting:** How do I define communication challenges before acting on them? Do I jump to solutions or analyze the problem first?

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="section-break" title="Segment 3 Intro">

## Segment 3: Continuous Development

**Building your communication learning plan**

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Why Continuous Learning Matters">

## The Continuous Learning Imperative

**Research Evidence:**

- **44%** of core skills will change by 2027 (World Economic Forum)
- **79%** of CEOs concerned skills shortages will hinder growth (PwC)
- **Purpose-driven learning** predicts successful skill development (MIT Sloan research)

**Implication:**
Communication competence is not a destination—it's a continuous journey requiring learning agility

**The shift:** "One life, one career" → Portfolio careers requiring constant adaptation

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="framework" title="Four Continuous Learning Strategies">

## Four Evidence-Based Learning Strategies

**From MIT Sloan Research (Tan & Tan, 2024):**

Based on qualitative interviews with 24 career switchers and survey analysis of 340 professionals

1. **Link Purpose to Learning** - Connect skills to career aspirations
2. **Create Learning-Rich Experiences** - Seek challenges beyond comfort zone
3. **Ask Meta-Learning Questions** - Structure ongoing self-assessment
4. **Nurture a Learning Team** - Develop feedback partnerships

**Each strategy is supported by empirical evidence**

Regression analyses showed purpose-driven learning significantly predicted successful skill development

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Strategy 1 - Link Purpose to Learning">

## Strategy 1: Link Purpose to Learning

**Research Finding:**
Sense of purpose predicts successful skill development—understanding WHY accelerates learning

**Application to Communication:**

**Three Types of Purpose:**

1. **Career Purpose:** How does communication excellence support your career goals?
   - Example: "I want to lead product teams, which requires influencing cross-functional stakeholders"

2. **Impact Purpose:** What change do you want to create through better communication?
   - Example: "I want to make sustainability compelling to business leaders"

3. **Growth Purpose:** What type of professional do you want to become?
   - Example: "I want to be someone people trust to communicate complex ideas clearly"

**Action:** Write one sentence connecting communication development to your larger purpose

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Strategy 2 - Create Learning-Rich Experiences">

## Strategy 2: Create Learning-Rich Experiences

**Research Finding:**
Varied and challenging tasks push beyond comfort zones and develop broader capabilities

**Application to Communication:**

**Characteristics of Learning-Rich Experiences:**
- **Stretch:** Just beyond current capability (not too easy, not overwhelming)
- **Variety:** Different communication contexts and formats
- **Consequences:** Real stakes that make outcomes matter
- **Feedback:** Clear signals about what's working

**Communication Examples:**
- If comfortable with writing → Seek oral presentation opportunities
- If confident in small groups → Volunteer for large audience presentations
- If strong on analysis → Practice storytelling and emotional connection
- If good at prepared remarks → Work on impromptu speaking

**Key:** Deliberately seek discomfort in service of growth

</slide>

<slide number="24" title="Strategy 3 - Meta-Learning Questions">

## Strategy 3: Ask Meta-Learning Questions

**Research Finding:**
Structured self-assessment questions turn experience into systematic learning

**Three Core Questions for Ongoing Development:**

1. **What do I need to learn?**
   - Communication example: "I need to learn how to handle hostile questions in presentations"

2. **How should I learn it?**
   - Communication example: "Watch examples, practice with peer feedback, seek mentoring from experienced presenters"

3. **Where are my strengths and gaps?**
   - Communication example: "Strong: written clarity. Gap: oral spontaneity and thinking on feet"

**Practice:** Ask these questions after every significant communication experience

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Strategy 4 - Learning Team">

## Strategy 4: Nurture a Learning Team

**Research Finding:**
Knowledge-sharing and constructive feedback accelerate growth when embedded in daily operations

**Communication Applications:**

**Types of Learning Partnerships:**

1. **Peer Feedback Partners:** Exchange drafts and presentation rehearsals
   - Meet regularly (monthly minimum)
   - Give specific, actionable feedback

2. **Mentors:** Seek experienced communicators for guidance
   - Ask for 15-minute quarterly check-ins
   - Come with specific questions

3. **Communities:** Join professional groups
   - Examples: Toastmasters, professional associations, alumni networks
   - Regular practice opportunities

4. **Accountability Partners:** Regular check-ins on development goals
   - Weekly or bi-weekly progress updates
   - Celebrate successes, troubleshoot challenges

**Key:** Make feedback a habit, not a one-time event

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="Building Your Development Plan">

## Building Your Personal Development Plan

**Combining All Four Strategies:**

1. **Purpose (Strategy 1):** My communication development serves this larger goal: ________________

2. **Experiences (Strategy 2):** These communication challenges will stretch me: ________________

3. **Meta-Learning (Strategy 3):**
   - I need to learn: ________________
   - I'll learn it by: ________________
   - My strengths and gaps: ________________

4. **Learning Team (Strategy 4):** These people will support my development: ________________

**Action:** Complete this framework in tutorial to create your 6-month plan

<slide number="27" layout="section-break" title="Segment 4 Intro">

## Segment 4: Capstone Excellence

**Demonstrating mastery through integration**

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="framework" title="Leadership Versatility Framework">

## Three Dimensions of Professional Versatility

**From McKinsey Research on CEO Excellence:**

Based on interviews with global CEOs including Mark Fields (Ford), Ed Bastian (Delta), and John Plant (Howmet Aerospace)

1. **Pursue Diverse Experiences** - Breadth across different contexts
   - Avoid becoming "pigeonholed as a one-note manager"
   - Develop multiple operating modes

2. **Go Deep (Constant Curiosity)** - Depth in core competencies
   - Master intricacies beyond surface-level understanding
   - Balance knowledge acquisition with confidence to execute

3. **Know When to Speak Up** - Authenticity and strategic timing
   - Navigate complex issues authentically
   - Take stance only when relevant and authentic
   - Avoid "empty suit" syndrome

**Communication Application:**
Your capstone demonstrates versatility—breadth of frameworks, depth of analysis, authentic delivery

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Case Study - Mark Fields">

## Case Study: Building Versatility

**Mark Fields, Former Ford CEO**

**Challenge:** Developing communication versatility across business conditions
- Different modes required: restructuring, growth, cost-cutting, innovation
- Each mode demands different communication approaches

**Approach:** Deliberately sought varied experiences to build "muscle memory"
- Took assignments in different regions and business units
- Led Ford through financial crisis, restructuring, and growth phases

**Quote:** "If you're putting yourself in positions in your career to get these different experiences, you're going to learn how to be a utility infielder."

**Lesson for Capstone:**
Show versatility by demonstrating you can pivot across frameworks and contexts, not just master one approach

</slide>

<slide number="30" title="Case Study - John Plant">

## Case Study: Going Deep

**John Plant, CEO of Howmet Aerospace**

**Challenge:** Leading through 2008 financial crisis while maintaining long-term vision
- Required both crisis communication and strategic vision communication

**Approach:** Deep understanding of business fundamentals enabled strategic pivots
- Mastered product technology, not just business metrics
- "The key is not just understanding what a product does but also how and why it does what it does"

**Result:** Led company through crisis to $13.5 billion acquisition

**Lesson for Capstone:**
Deep analysis beats surface-level application—demonstrate genuine understanding, not just framework name-dropping

</slide>

<slide number="31" title="Case Study - Ed Bastian">

## Case Study: Learning Agility

**Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines**

**Challenge:** Leading through COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented uncertainty
- Business model disrupted overnight
- Required rapid learning and communication pivots

**Approach:** "The way you deal with this uncertainty is you learn, learn, learn"
- Constant information gathering from multiple sources
- Transparent communication about what he knew and didn't know

**Result:** Delta emerged as industry leader through crisis

**Lesson for Capstone:**
Acknowledge what you don't know—authentic uncertainty beats false confidence

</slide>

<slide number="32" title="Capstone Self-Assessment Questions">

## Preparing for Capstone Excellence

**Before your presentation, reflect:**

**Breadth (Dimension 1):**
- Have I applied diverse frameworks appropriate to this problem?
- Can I justify why I selected these frameworks over alternatives?

**Depth (Dimension 2):**
- Can I defend every claim with evidence and reasoning?
- Have I thought through implementation challenges and counter-arguments?

**Authenticity (Dimension 3):**
- Do I genuinely care about this topic and its recommendations?
- Am I speaking to areas where I have real knowledge, or faking expertise?

**Integration:**
- Does this presentation synthesize course learning, not just repeat it?
- Have I woven frameworks together, not just listed them sequentially?

**Impact:**
- What specific action should the audience take based on my analysis?
- Is this actionable, or just interesting observations?

**Excellent capstones score high on ALL five dimensions**

</slide>

<slide number="33" title="Integration vs Repetition">

## Integration vs. Repetition (Critical Distinction)

**Repetition (Weak Capstone):**
- "First we'll discuss Cialdini, then Hofstede, then Executive Presence..."
- Frameworks presented separately with forced connections
- Feels like a course summary, not new analysis
- Sequential structure: Framework 1 → Framework 2 → Framework 3

**Integration (Strong Capstone):**
- "This cross-cultural persuasion challenge requires simultaneously understanding power distance (Hofstede), establishing credibility (Executive Presence), and applying authority principle (Cialdini)..."
- Frameworks woven together to solve a specific problem
- Feels like professional consulting analysis
- Integrated structure: Problem → Multi-framework analysis → Synthesized solution

**Your capstone should demonstrate synthesis, not summarization**

</slide>

<slide number="34" title="What Synthesis Looks Like">

## Example of Framework Synthesis

**Case:** Vietnamese startup pitching to American venture capitalists

**Weak Analysis (Sequential Frameworks):**
1. Cialdini section: Use authority and social proof
2. Hofstede section: Vietnam is collectivist, US is individualist
3. Pyramid Principle section: Structure argument logically
4. Conclusion: Apply all three

**Strong Analysis (Integrated Frameworks):**
"The cultural gap (Hofstede) requires modified persuasion tactics (Cialdini). American VCs expect individual founder credibility (authority), but Vietnamese culture emphasizes team harmony. Our recommendation: Lead with founder credentials (authority) while showcasing collective team expertise (adapted for US individualism). Structure using Pyramid Principle, but frame data points to emphasize individual ROI (US values) rather than community benefit (Vietnamese values)."

**The frameworks interact and modify each other—that's synthesis**

</slide>

<slide number="35" title="Common Capstone Pitfalls">

## Common Capstone Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Framework Tourism**
- Mentioning every framework briefly without deep application
- Fix: Choose 3-4 frameworks and apply them thoroughly

**Pitfall 2: The Laundry List**
- "Here are 10 recommendations" without prioritization
- Fix: Identify 2-3 core recommendations with clear prioritization

**Pitfall 3: Missing the "So What?"**
- Interesting analysis that leads nowhere actionable
- Fix: Every analysis section should lead to specific recommendations

**Pitfall 4: Fake Integration**
- Frameworks mentioned in introduction, then never actually used in analysis
- Fix: Show frameworks in action, not just in outline

**Pitfall 5: Death by Slides**
- 50+ slides trying to cover everything
- Fix: 15-20 slides with focused argument (use appendix for details)

</slide>

<slide number="37" layout="section-break" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

**Today's Core Insights**

</slide>

<slide number="38" title="Summary">

## Today's Key Takeaways

1. **Kolb's Cycle:** Learning requires experiencing, reflecting, conceptualizing, and experimenting—complete all four stages to turn experience into expertise

2. **Schön's Practice:** Professionals develop knowing-in-action (automatic skills), reflection-in-action (real-time adjustment), and reflection-on-action (systematic improvement)

3. **Continuous Learning:** Four evidence-based strategies: Link purpose to learning, create learning-rich experiences, ask meta-questions, nurture learning teams

4. **Capstone Versatility:** Demonstrate breadth (diverse frameworks), depth (rigorous analysis), and authenticity (genuine conviction)—synthesis over summarization

5. **Problem Setting:** Define the right problem before solving it—communication failures often result from solving the wrong problem

**Meta-Takeaway:** The frameworks you've learned matter less than your capacity to keep learning

</slide>

<slide number="39" title="From Frameworks to Mindset">

## The Shift from Frameworks to Mindset

**What You've Learned:**
- Pyramid Principle, Cialdini, Hofstede, Executive Presence, Visual Communication...
- Specific techniques and frameworks

**What Really Matters:**
- The habit of asking "What communication challenge am I solving?"
- The practice of reflecting in-action and on-action
- The commitment to continuous improvement
- The ability to synthesize multiple perspectives

**Frameworks are tools. Mindset is what makes you effective.**

**Your goal after this course:** Internalize the learning mindset, not just memorize the frameworks

</slide>

<slide number="40" title="Assessment Preparation">

</slide>

<slide number="44" title="Final Reflection">

## Your Communication Journey

**Reflection Prompt (Personal, Not Graded):**

Think back to Week 1. How has your understanding of "communication competence" changed?

1. **Surprise:** What surprised you most about what makes communication effective?

2. **Impact:** Which framework has influenced your thinking most profoundly?

3. **Pride:** What communication capability are you most proud of developing?

4. **Future:** What will you continue working on after this course ends?

**Write these down for yourself—they'll inform your capstone narrative and development plan**

</slide>

<slide number="45" title="Closing Thoughts">

## Closing Thoughts

**What Communication Competence Really Means:**

Not the ability to deliver a perfect presentation

Not mastering every framework in business communication

Not sounding impressive with sophisticated vocabulary

**But rather:**

- The **curiosity** to understand your audience deeply
- The **humility** to reflect on what's working and what isn't
- The **courage** to speak up when you have something valuable to contribute
- The **discipline** to improve continuously throughout your career

**These meta-skills will serve you long after specific frameworks fade from memory**

**Thank you for your engagement this semester. You're ready for what comes next.**
