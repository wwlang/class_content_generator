## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle:** Learning progresses through Concrete Experience (doing), Reflective Observation (reviewing), Abstract Conceptualization (concluding), Active Experimentation (planning). Your capstone presentation is Stage 4—testing your integrated mastery through full performance.

- **Schön's Reflective Practice:** Professionals develop through reflection-in-action (real-time adjustment during performance) and reflection-on-action (retrospective analysis). Today you'll practice both—adjusting during Q&A and analyzing after the run-through.

- **Problem Setting vs. Problem Solving:** Experts frame problems from ambiguous situations before solving them. Your capstone should demonstrate how you framed your communication challenge, not just how you solved it.

- **Framework Integration Levels:** Level 3 (Strategic Integration) means frameworks inform each other with clear reasoning—"We analyzed X which led us to choose Y approach which shaped how we applied Z." This is your capstone goal.

- **Capstone Success Criteria:** Strategic Foundation (audience analysis, communication objectives), Content Excellence (structure, persuasion, evidence), Delivery Mastery (confidence, visuals, presence), Integration & Awareness (meta-awareness of choices).

**What good work looks like:**

- **Content & Analysis (30%):** Sophisticated framework application with compelling evidence and exceptional depth
- **Delivery & Presence (25%):** Commanding presence, engaging throughout, perfect voice and pace
- **Visual Design (15%):** Professional-quality slides with perfect visual hierarchy that enhances message
- **Team Coordination (15%):** Seamless transitions, perfect balance among speakers, unified team appearance
- **Q&A Performance (15%):** Handles all questions brilliantly, demonstrates expert knowledge, composed under pressure

## Main Activity: Full Dress Rehearsal of Group Presentation

**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12) - This is your final full practice before the graded performance. Today you run through your complete 15-minute presentation + 10-minute Q&A and receive structured peer feedback using actual rubric criteria.

**The Task:**

Deliver your complete Group Presentation exactly as you will in Week 12. This is a **full dress rehearsal**—not a planning session, not an outline discussion, but a complete performance from opening to closing, followed by Q&A and peer feedback.

Your team will present to peer teams who will evaluate using the actual Presentation Rubric criteria and provide specific feedback on what needs improvement before Week 12.

**Deliverable:**

1. **Complete 15-Minute Presentation** (timed strictly)
   - Full team delivery with all members presenting
   - Actual slides or near-final versions
   - Opening hook through closing statement
   - Smooth transitions between speakers

2. **10-Minute Q&A Performance**
   - Respond to audience questions using reflection-in-action
   - All team members participate in fielding questions
   - Demonstrate deep knowledge and composure

3. **Peer Feedback Notes** (received from evaluating teams)
   - Strengths identified across all 5 rubric criteria
   - Development areas with specific recommendations
   - One critical improvement needed before Week 12
   - Overall rubric level assessment (Excellent/Good/Satisfactory/Needs Work)

**Success Criteria:** (from Group Presentation Rubric)

- **Content & Analysis:** Framework application evident and sophisticated; evidence compelling; exceptional depth in analysis
- **Delivery & Presence:** Confident and engaging delivery; strong voice, pace, and eye contact; professional presence throughout

**Self-Reflection Questions:**

After receiving peer feedback, each team should discuss:
1. What surprised us about the feedback we received?
2. Which rubric criterion needs most improvement before Week 12?
3. What specific changes will we make to our slides, delivery, or Q&A preparation?
4. How will we practice individually before Week 12?

**Activity Structure:**

**Phase 1: Presentation Set-Up (5 minutes)**
- Teams claim presentation spaces (front of room or designated areas)
- Technical check: slides loading, timing device ready
- Evaluating teams prepare feedback templates and questions

**Phase 2: Full Dress Rehearsals (65 minutes)**
- **Per team allocation: 30 minutes total**
  - 15 minutes: Complete presentation (strictly timed)
  - 10 minutes: Q&A from audience (peer teams ask questions)
  - 5 minutes: Immediate feedback discussion
- **2-3 teams present** depending on class size
- All other teams serve as audience and complete feedback templates
- Tutor observes and takes notes for final debrief

**Phase 3: Class Debrief (10 minutes)**
- Each presenting team shares: One strength identified, one critical improvement needed
- Tutor highlights patterns observed across presentations
- Final reminders about Week 12 logistics

**Class Feedback:**

All presenting teams will share in the debrief:
- One strength identified by multiple peer evaluators
- One critical improvement area needing work before Week 12
- One specific action you'll take to improve

Non-presenting teams will share:
- Most common strength you observed across presentations
- Most common development area you identified

**Participation:** All teams must be prepared to present if called. Non-presenting teams must complete peer feedback templates for all presenting teams. Thoughtful, specific feedback is essential—generic comments will affect participation marks.

**Tutorial Success:**

By the end of this session, your team should:
- Have completed one full run-through under realistic conditions
- Understand exact timing (15 minutes is strict—practice hitting it precisely)
- Have received specific, rubric-based feedback on all 5 criteria
- Know exactly what to improve before Week 12 graded performance
- Have practiced Q&A under pressure with real audience questions
