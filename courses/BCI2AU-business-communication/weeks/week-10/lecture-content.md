<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="Hook">

# 44%

**of core skills will change by 2027**

*(World Economic Forum, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
This statistic from the World Economic Forum highlights a critical reality—the skills you're developing now are just the foundation. The ability to learn continuously and adapt your communication style will be more valuable than any single technique.

This connects directly to why we're focusing today on reflective practice and development planning. It's not just about what you've learned—it's about developing the capacity to keep learning throughout your career.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle to integrate course frameworks
2. **Evaluate** your communication development using Schön's reflective practice model
3. **Create** a personal development plan using evidence-based continuous learning strategies
4. **Demonstrate** course synthesis through capstone presentation planning

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are testable and will appear on next week's quiz. More importantly, they represent meta-skills—the ability to learn from experience and plan your own development.

Connection to assessments: Objectives 1 and 2 directly support your Executive Summary due this week. Objectives 3 and 4 prepare you for your Week 12 Group Presentation.
</speaker-notes>

4. **Capstone Excellence** - Preparing to demonstrate mastery (20 min)

<speaker-notes>
This roadmap shows our progression from foundational theory to practical application. We'll return to this slide at each transition point to help you track where we are in the lecture.

Notice the structure mirrors Kolb's cycle—we'll experience the frameworks, reflect on them, conceptualize how they apply, and plan how to use them.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Segment 1 Intro">

## Segment 1: The Learning Cycle

**How professionals turn experience into expertise**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to first segment. We begin with David Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle—arguably the most influential framework in adult learning theory with over 16,000 citations.

This framework explains how you've actually been learning throughout this course, and more importantly, how you'll continue learning after graduation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle">

## Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

**Four-Stage Continuous Learning Process**

1. **Concrete Experience (CE)** - Do: Engage in new experience
2. **Reflective Observation (RO)** - Review: Observe from multiple perspectives
3. **Abstract Conceptualization (AC)** - Conclude: Create theories to explain
4. **Active Experimentation (AE)** - Plan: Test theories in new situations

**Key Insight:** Learning requires all four stages; can enter anywhere but must complete the cycle

<speaker-notes>
Kolb's cycle explains why lecture alone doesn't create learning—you need the full cycle. A diagram can help here—drawing a circular diagram showing the four stages flowing into each other, with arrows indicating the continuous nature.

Think about how this course has been structured: you experienced communication challenges in tutorials (CE), reflected on what worked (RO), learned frameworks to explain your observations (AC), then applied those frameworks in new contexts (AE).

Most students immediately recognize this pattern once explained. The power is in making it conscious so you can replicate it after the course ends.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" title="Course Journey Through the Cycle">

## Your Communication Journey Through Kolb's Cycle

**Concrete Experience:**
- Tutorial activities, presentation delivery, memo writing
- Portfolio assignments with real-world scenarios

**Reflective Observation:**
- Peer feedback sessions, self-assessment, portfolio review
- Analyzing what worked and what didn't

**Abstract Conceptualization:**
- Frameworks: Pyramid Principle, Cialdini, Hofstede, Executive Presence
- Understanding why certain approaches work

**Active Experimentation:**
- Applying frameworks to new scenarios, portfolio assignments, group work
- Testing new communication strategies

<speaker-notes>
This slide demonstrates that we've deliberately designed this course around Kolb's cycle. You haven't just been learning content—you've been developing a learning process.

Key connection: The cycle explains why some students improved dramatically while others plateaued. Students who completed all four stages learned more than those who skipped reflection or conceptualization.

Common student question: "Which stage is most important?" Answer: All are essential, but most people naturally prefer one or two. Recognizing your preference helps identify growth areas.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Four Learning Styles">

## Four Learning Styles (Kolb)

**Based on which stages you prefer:**

- **Diverging (CE/RO):** Imaginative, views from multiple perspectives
  - Strength: Seeing situations from different angles
  - Development need: May struggle with decisive action

- **Assimilating (AC/RO):** Logical, organizing information into frameworks
  - Strength: Creating comprehensive theories
  - Development need: May prefer ideas over practical application

- **Converging (AC/AE):** Problem-solving, finding practical applications
  - Strength: Making decisions and solving problems
  - Development need: May overlook alternative perspectives

- **Accommodating (CE/AE):** Hands-on, action-oriented, intuitive
  - Strength: Getting things done, adaptability
  - Development need: May act without adequate reflection

**No style is "better"—but effective professionals develop flexibility across all modes**

<speaker-notes>
Learning styles are descriptive, not prescriptive. The goal isn't to "find your style and stick to it"—it's to recognize your natural preferences and deliberately develop the others.

Example: If you're a "Converging" learner who excels at problem-solving, you might struggle with the "Diverging" skill of viewing situations from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Recognizing this helps you strengthen that capability.

For communication specifically: effective communicators need all four modes. You need hands-on practice (Accommodating), reflection on audience needs (Diverging), frameworks to organize thinking (Assimilating), and practical application skills (Converging).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Identifying Your Learning Preference">

## Identifying Your Learning Preference

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. **Concrete Experience:** Do I learn best by doing and experiencing directly?
2. **Reflective Observation:** Do I learn best by watching and reflecting?
3. **Abstract Conceptualization:** Do I learn best by thinking and analyzing?
4. **Active Experimentation:** Do I learn best by testing and experimenting?

**Most people have two preferred modes**

**Development Strategy:** Identify your weaker modes and deliberately practice them

<speaker-notes>
These questions help students identify their learning preferences. The worksheet in tutorial could have them complete a simplified Learning Style Inventory.

Key insight: Your weaker modes represent your biggest growth opportunities. If you naturally gravitate toward action (CE/AE) but avoid reflection (RO) and theory (AC), you're missing crucial learning stages.

Real-world application: Understanding your learning style helps you design better professional development. If you know you're weak at reflection, you can deliberately build in time for after-action reviews.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Application to Communication Development">

## Applying the Cycle to Your Communication Growth

**Concrete Experience:**
- What communication challenges have you faced this semester?
- Which assignments pushed you outside your comfort zone?

**Reflective Observation:**
- What patterns emerged in your successes and struggles?
- What feedback did you receive consistently?

**Abstract Conceptualization:**
- Which frameworks resonate most with your experiences?
- What communication principles have you internalized?

**Active Experimentation:**
- How will you test these insights in new contexts?
- What communication experiments will you run next?

<speaker-notes>
These questions form the basis for self-assessment activities. Rather than giving students generic reflection prompts, we're providing a structured framework that ensures thorough self-examination.

The worksheet in tutorial could use these as guided reflection questions—give students 2 minutes per quadrant to jot down thoughts. Not collected, purely for personal awareness.

Transition: Now that we understand how learning happens, let's examine how professionals engage in this reflectively.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2 Intro">

## Segment 2: Reflective Practice

**Turning experience into professional expertise**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to second segment. We now shift from understanding the learning cycle to engaging in reflective practice—Donald Schön's foundational framework with 8,900+ citations.

While Kolb explains what the learning process looks like, Schön explains how professionals actually do it in practice, particularly in fields like communication where much of the expertise is tacit.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="framework" title="Schön's Reflective Practice">

## Schön's Reflective Practice Model

**Three Modes of Professional Knowledge:**

**Knowing-in-Action:**
- Tacit knowledge embedded in skillful performance
- "The best professionals know more than they can put into words"
- Automatic, intuitive responses developed through experience

**Reflection-in-Action:**
- Real-time thinking while performing (during presentation, mid-conversation)
- Adjusting approach based on immediate feedback
- "Thinking on your feet"

**Reflection-on-Action:**
- Retrospective analysis after the experience
- Examining what worked and why
- Planning improvements for next time

<speaker-notes>
Schön's three-part framework explains the different ways professionals use knowledge. Knowing-in-action is why experts sometimes struggle to explain what they do—it's become automatic.

This is like the "10,000 hours" concept—with enough practice, communication skills become intuitive. But that doesn't mean you should stop reflecting; reflection helps you continue improving even after skills become automatic.

The distinction between "in-action" and "on-action" is crucial. Many students only engage in reflection-on-action (if at all), but professionals operate in both modes simultaneously.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Reflection in Communication Contexts">

## Reflective Practice in Business Communication

**Knowing-in-Action Examples:**
- Automatically adjusting tone for different audiences
- Intuitively structuring arguments persuasively
- Naturally reading audience cues and body language

**Reflection-in-Action Examples:**
- Noticing audience confusion during presentation → adding an additional example
- Sensing resistance in negotiation → shifting persuasive approach
- Detecting email miscommunication → picking up phone instead

**Reflection-on-Action Examples:**
- Analyzing why memo wasn't persuasive → improving evidence base
- Reviewing presentation feedback → identifying delivery patterns
- Examining failed persuasion attempt → strengthening framework application

<speaker-notes>
These examples make the abstract concepts concrete for communication contexts. Students typically relate strongly to these scenarios—they've experienced most of them.

Key insight: The best communicators do all three modes. They've developed automatic skills (knowing-in-action), adjust in real-time (reflection-in-action), AND analyze afterwards to improve systematically (reflection-on-action).

You could poll students: "How many of you adjusted your communication mid-conversation this week based on the other person's reaction?" Most hands will go up, validating that they already engage in reflection-in-action, even if unconsciously.

This is the skill that needs to become conscious and systematic for professional excellence.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="The Reflective Conversation">

## The "Conversation with the Situation"

**Schön's Key Concept:**
Effective professionals engage in ongoing dialogue with their work, treating problems as dynamic rather than static

**Communication Application:**

**Linear Approach (Weak):**
1. Analyze audience
2. Develop message
3. Deliver communication
4. Done

**Reflective Approach (Strong):**
1. Analyze audience → Notice gaps in understanding
2. Develop message → Test assumptions about what will persuade
3. Deliver communication → Monitor reactions and adjust
4. Reflect on outcomes → Refine approach for next time
5. **Repeat cycle continuously**

<speaker-notes>
The "conversation with the situation" is Schön's metaphor for professional expertise. Rather than following a linear procedure, experts continuously test and refine their approach based on feedback.

Example: An expert presenter doesn't just deliver prepared slides. They read the room, notice when engagement drops, adjust pacing, add examples, skip less relevant material, and continuously calibrate based on audience response. That's a conversation.

Compare to a novice presenter who delivers the same content regardless of audience reaction—that's following a script, not engaging in professional practice.

This connects to Week 2's audience analysis and Week 8's executive presence—both require real-time responsiveness, not just planning.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Problem Setting vs Problem Solving">

## Problem Setting vs. Problem Solving

**Schön's Key Insight:**
Effective professionals don't just solve given problems—they construct and frame problems from ambiguous situations

**Communication Application:**

**Weak approach:** "I need to give a presentation" → applies standard template

**Strong approach:** "What communication challenge am I actually facing here?"
- Is this a persuasion problem? (resistance to overcome)
- A knowledge problem? (audience lacks context)
- A relationship problem? (trust needs building)
- A complexity problem? (simplification required)

**Different problem definitions → Different communication strategies**

<speaker-notes>
This framework connects directly to Week 2's strategic communication and Week 1's audience analysis. Many communication failures happen because people solve the wrong problem.

Example: A manager thinks they have a "presentation problem" and focuses on slide design. But the actual issue is a stakeholder alignment problem—key decision-makers weren't consulted early. No amount of beautiful slides solves the wrong problem.

This is why strategic thinking precedes tactical execution. Before applying frameworks like Pyramid Principle or Cialdini, you must first understand what challenge you're actually addressing.

Real-world application: When students face communication challenges in their careers, the first question should be "What problem am I really solving?" not "What technique should I use?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="From Novice to Expert">

## The Journey from Novice to Expert Communicator

**Novice:**
- Follows rules and procedures rigidly
- Needs explicit frameworks for every situation
- Reflection happens only when prompted

**Competent:**
- Applies frameworks flexibly
- Recognizes patterns across situations
- Reflects regularly on performance

**Expert:**
- Intuitive responses (knowing-in-action)
- Continuous real-time adjustment (reflection-in-action)
- Systematic learning from experience (reflection-on-action)
- **All three modes operating simultaneously**

**Your goal: Move from novice toward competent and expert practice**

<speaker-notes>
This progression from novice to expert helps students understand where they are and where they're going. Most students in this course are moving from novice toward competent—that's exactly what we'd expect.

The key difference between competent and expert is that experts have internalized frameworks so deeply they operate automatically, while still maintaining conscious reflection. It's unconscious competence combined with conscious improvement.

Example: A novice presenter consciously thinks "I need to use Pyramid Principle here." A competent presenter naturally structures arguments that way. An expert does it automatically AND reflects on whether Pyramid Principle is the right framework for this specific situation.

This connects to the learning cycle—experts complete Kolb's four stages faster and more fluidly than novices.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Self-Assessment Framework">

## Structured Self-Assessment Questions

**Based on Schön's Reflective Practice:**

1. **Knowing-in-Action:** What communication skills have become automatic for me? What do I do intuitively without thinking?

2. **Reflection-in-Action:** When do I adjust my communication in real-time? What cues trigger those adjustments?

3. **Reflection-on-Action:** What patterns have I noticed in my communication successes and challenges across the semester?

4. **Problem Setting:** How do I define communication challenges before acting on them? Do I jump to solutions or analyze the problem first?

<speaker-notes>
These four questions provide a systematic framework for self-assessment. Rather than vague "reflect on your learning," students now have specific prompts that surface genuine insights.

The worksheet in tutorial uses these as guided reflection questions. Students could spend 3-4 minutes per question, writing down thoughts. This is personal reflection, not collected.

The questions deliberately progress from unconscious competence (knowing-in-action) to conscious strategic thinking (problem setting), mirroring the journey from novice to expert communicator.

Transition: Reflection is essential, but it must lead to action. Let's explore how to turn insights into continuous development.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="section-break" title="Segment 3 Intro">

## Segment 3: Continuous Development

**Building your communication learning plan**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to third segment. We shift from understanding learning processes and reflective practice to practical development planning.

This section draws on recent MIT Sloan Management Review research providing evidence-based strategies you can implement immediately.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Why Continuous Learning Matters">

## The Continuous Learning Imperative

**Research Evidence:**

- **44%** of core skills will change by 2027 (World Economic Forum)
- **79%** of CEOs concerned skills shortages will hinder growth (PwC)
- **Purpose-driven learning** predicts successful skill development (MIT Sloan research)

**Implication:**
Communication competence is not a destination—it's a continuous journey requiring learning agility

**The shift:** "One life, one career" → Portfolio careers requiring constant adaptation

<speaker-notes>
These statistics reinforce our opening hook with additional context. The PwC finding about CEO concerns makes this personally relevant—employers will value learning agility as much as current skills.

The MIT Sloan finding about purpose-driven learning is particularly powerful. Students who understand WHY they're developing communication skills learn faster and retain more than those who see it as just a requirement.

Connection to student experience: You could ask "How many of you have clearer career goals now than when you started this course?" Many hands typically go up. That clarity of purpose should now accelerate their continued development.

The "portfolio careers" concept is important—most graduates will have multiple careers, not just multiple jobs. Each career transition requires learning new communication contexts.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="framework" title="Four Continuous Learning Strategies">

## Four Evidence-Based Learning Strategies

**From MIT Sloan Research (Tan & Tan, 2024):**

Based on qualitative interviews with 24 career switchers and survey analysis of 340 professionals

1. **Link Purpose to Learning** - Connect skills to career aspirations
2. **Create Learning-Rich Experiences** - Seek challenges beyond comfort zone
3. **Ask Meta-Learning Questions** - Structure ongoing self-assessment
4. **Nurture a Learning Team** - Develop feedback partnerships

**Each strategy is supported by empirical evidence**

Regression analyses showed purpose-driven learning significantly predicted successful skill development

<speaker-notes>
These four strategies provide actionable structure for development planning. They're not abstract theory—they come from rigorous qualitative and quantitative research with real professionals.

Key insight: These aren't just good ideas, they're statistically validated predictors of successful skill development. The regression analyses provide empirical support.

The tutorial activity will use these four strategies as the organizing framework for personal development plans. Students can apply this structure to any skill, not just communication.

This is practical research—students can literally implement these strategies starting this week.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Strategy 1 - Link Purpose to Learning">

## Strategy 1: Link Purpose to Learning

**Research Finding:**
Sense of purpose predicts successful skill development—understanding WHY accelerates learning

**Application to Communication:**

**Three Types of Purpose:**

1. **Career Purpose:** How does communication excellence support your career goals?
   - Example: "I want to lead product teams, which requires influencing cross-functional stakeholders"

2. **Impact Purpose:** What change do you want to create through better communication?
   - Example: "I want to make sustainability compelling to business leaders"

3. **Growth Purpose:** What type of professional do you want to become?
   - Example: "I want to be someone people trust to communicate complex ideas clearly"

**Action:** Write one sentence connecting communication development to your larger purpose

<speaker-notes>
This strategy transforms communication from an academic requirement into a personally meaningful capability. When students connect skills to authentic purpose, motivation shifts from external (grades) to internal (growth).

The three types of purpose give students multiple entry points. Some students have clear career goals (career purpose), others are motivated by making a difference (impact purpose), still others by personal growth (growth purpose).

Example of strong purpose statement: "I'm developing communication skills because I want to lead sustainability initiatives in Vietnam, which requires influencing stakeholders who don't initially care about environmental issues." That's specific, authentic, and motivating.

Contrast with weak statement: "I need good communication skills to get a job." That's generic and externally motivated.

The tutorial activity will have students articulate their specific purpose statement. This becomes the foundation for their development plan.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Strategy 2 - Create Learning-Rich Experiences">

## Strategy 2: Create Learning-Rich Experiences

**Research Finding:**
Varied and challenging tasks push beyond comfort zones and develop broader capabilities

**Application to Communication:**

**Characteristics of Learning-Rich Experiences:**
- **Stretch:** Just beyond current capability (not too easy, not overwhelming)
- **Variety:** Different communication contexts and formats
- **Consequences:** Real stakes that make outcomes matter
- **Feedback:** Clear signals about what's working

**Communication Examples:**
- If comfortable with writing → Seek oral presentation opportunities
- If confident in small groups → Volunteer for large audience presentations
- If strong on analysis → Practice storytelling and emotional connection
- If good at prepared remarks → Work on impromptu speaking

**Key:** Deliberately seek discomfort in service of growth

<speaker-notes>
This strategy operationalizes the "zone of proximal development"—the sweet spot where learning happens. Too easy means no growth. Too hard means overwhelm and shutdown.

For communication: If presentations feel comfortable, that's a signal you need harder challenges. Seek executive briefings, cross-cultural contexts, or high-stakes situations.

Real-world application: In your career, don't just do what you're already good at. Volunteer for communication challenges that scare you slightly. That's where growth happens.

The research showed professionals who deliberately sought varied experiences developed broader capabilities than those who stayed in their comfort zone.

Connection to Kolb: Learning-rich experiences provide the "Concrete Experience" that kicks off the learning cycle.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" title="Strategy 3 - Meta-Learning Questions">

## Strategy 3: Ask Meta-Learning Questions

**Research Finding:**
Structured self-assessment questions turn experience into systematic learning

**Three Core Questions for Ongoing Development:**

1. **What do I need to learn?**
   - Communication example: "I need to learn how to handle hostile questions in presentations"

2. **How should I learn it?**
   - Communication example: "Watch examples, practice with peer feedback, seek mentoring from experienced presenters"

3. **Where are my strengths and gaps?**
   - Communication example: "Strong: written clarity. Gap: oral spontaneity and thinking on feet"

**Practice:** Ask these questions after every significant communication experience

<speaker-notes>
These meta-learning questions operationalize Schön's reflection-on-action framework. They provide a systematic way to turn experiences into insights.

The key word is "meta"—these aren't questions about the content, they're questions about the learning process itself. That's what makes them powerful.

Example of applying all three questions: After a presentation that didn't go well, ask:
1. What do I need to learn? → Better audience analysis and slide design
2. How should I learn it? → Review Week 2 and Week 6 materials, practice with peer feedback
3. Strengths and gaps? → Strong on content knowledge, weak on visual communication

These questions turn failure into learning. Without them, you might just feel bad about the presentation. With them, you have a development roadmap.

The tutorial worksheet could have students apply these questions to a recent communication experience.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Strategy 4 - Learning Team">

## Strategy 4: Nurture a Learning Team

**Research Finding:**
Knowledge-sharing and constructive feedback accelerate growth when embedded in daily operations

**Communication Applications:**

**Types of Learning Partnerships:**

1. **Peer Feedback Partners:** Exchange drafts and presentation rehearsals
   - Meet regularly (monthly minimum)
   - Give specific, actionable feedback

2. **Mentors:** Seek experienced communicators for guidance
   - Ask for 15-minute quarterly check-ins
   - Come with specific questions

3. **Communities:** Join professional groups
   - Examples: Toastmasters, professional associations, alumni networks
   - Regular practice opportunities

4. **Accountability Partners:** Regular check-ins on development goals
   - Weekly or bi-weekly progress updates
   - Celebrate successes, troubleshoot challenges

**Key:** Make feedback a habit, not a one-time event

<speaker-notes>
This strategy addresses the reality that communication is inherently social—you can't develop in isolation. The research shows that learning teams aren't just helpful, they're essential for sustained development.

Practical suggestion: Students should identify at least one peer from this class to continue exchanging feedback after the course ends. That peer knows their baseline and can track progress over time.

Example of embedding learning in operations: Set a monthly calendar reminder to ask three colleagues "What's one communication strength you see in me, and one area I could strengthen?" Make it routine.

The best professional communicators all have feedback systems—formal or informal—that give them continuous data on their effectiveness.

Toastmasters is specifically worth mentioning—it's a global organization dedicated to public speaking practice with structured feedback. Many cities in Vietnam have chapters.

Transition: These four strategies provide the structure. Now let's apply them to capstone preparation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="Building Your Development Plan">

## Building Your Personal Development Plan

**Combining All Four Strategies:**

1. **Purpose (Strategy 1):** My communication development serves this larger goal: ________________

2. **Experiences (Strategy 2):** These communication challenges will stretch me: ________________

3. **Meta-Learning (Strategy 3):**
   - I need to learn: ________________
   - I'll learn it by: ________________
   - My strengths and gaps: ________________

4. **Learning Team (Strategy 4):** These people will support my development: ________________

**Action:** Complete this framework in tutorial to create your 6-month plan

<speaker-notes>
This framework synthesizes the four strategies into a concrete development plan template. The tutorial activity will have students fill this out completely.

Key insight: All four strategies work together. Purpose provides motivation. Experiences provide data. Meta-learning questions convert data to insights. Learning teams accelerate progress.

Students should walk out of tutorial with a completed one-page development plan they can actually use. This isn't academic exercise—it's practical career planning.

The 6-month timeframe is deliberate—long enough to make meaningful progress, short enough to maintain focus. Students should revisit and revise quarterly.

## Segment 4: Capstone Excellence

**Demonstrating mastery through integration**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to final segment. We now apply everything to your capstone presentations—the culminating demonstration of your communication competence.

This section draws on McKinsey research on leadership versatility, providing a framework for self-assessment and presentation excellence.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="framework" title="Leadership Versatility Framework">

## Three Dimensions of Professional Versatility

**From McKinsey Research on CEO Excellence:**

Based on interviews with global CEOs including Mark Fields (Ford), Ed Bastian (Delta), and John Plant (Howmet Aerospace)

1. **Pursue Diverse Experiences** - Breadth across different contexts
   - Avoid becoming "pigeonholed as a one-note manager"
   - Develop multiple operating modes

2. **Go Deep (Constant Curiosity)** - Depth in core competencies
   - Master intricacies beyond surface-level understanding
   - Balance knowledge acquisition with confidence to execute

3. **Know When to Speak Up** - Authenticity and strategic timing
   - Navigate complex issues authentically
   - Take stance only when relevant and authentic
   - Avoid "empty suit" syndrome

**Communication Application:**
Your capstone demonstrates versatility—breadth of frameworks, depth of analysis, authentic delivery

<speaker-notes>
This McKinsey framework provides sophisticated guidance for capstone presentations. It's based on extensive interviews with global CEOs, so it represents the highest level of professional communication.

The framework answers a key student question: "What makes a presentation excellent vs. merely good?" Excellence requires demonstrating all three dimensions.

Dimension 1 (Diverse Experiences): Show you can apply multiple frameworks to a problem—not just your favorite one. The best capstones weave together Cialdini, Hofstede, Executive Presence, Visual Communication, and more.

Dimension 2 (Go Deep): Demonstrate genuine understanding, not surface-level knowledge. Can you answer challenging questions about your recommendations? Have you thought through implementation challenges?

Dimension 3 (Know When to Speak Up): Speak with authentic conviction on topics where you have real expertise and stake. Don't try to fake expertise you don't have. Choose capstone topics you genuinely care about.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Case Study - Mark Fields">

## Case Study: Building Versatility

**Mark Fields, Former Ford CEO**

**Challenge:** Developing communication versatility across business conditions
- Different modes required: restructuring, growth, cost-cutting, innovation
- Each mode demands different communication approaches

**Approach:** Deliberately sought varied experiences to build "muscle memory"
- Took assignments in different regions and business units
- Led Ford through financial crisis, restructuring, and growth phases

**Quote:** "If you're putting yourself in positions in your career to get these different experiences, you're going to learn how to be a utility infielder."

**Lesson for Capstone:**
Show versatility by demonstrating you can pivot across frameworks and contexts, not just master one approach

<speaker-notes>
The Mark Fields case illustrates what professional versatility looks like in practice. "Utility infielder" is a baseball metaphor—a player who can perform well at multiple positions, not just one specialty.

For communication capstones, this means demonstrating you can analyze a problem from multiple angles (stakeholder mapping, persuasion analysis, cultural dimensions, crisis communication) and select the right approach for the context.

Weak capstone: "We analyzed this using Cialdini because that's what we're most comfortable with."

Strong capstone: "We considered three analytical approaches—persuasion analysis, cultural dimensions, and visual communication—and selected cultural dimensions as primary because the core issue is cross-cultural misalignment, not persuasive technique. However, we also incorporate Cialdini's reciprocity principle in our implementation plan."

That demonstration of strategic selection shows versatility.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="30" title="Case Study - John Plant">

## Case Study: Going Deep

**John Plant, CEO of Howmet Aerospace**

**Challenge:** Leading through 2008 financial crisis while maintaining long-term vision
- Required both crisis communication and strategic vision communication

**Approach:** Deep understanding of business fundamentals enabled strategic pivots
- Mastered product technology, not just business metrics
- "The key is not just understanding what a product does but also how and why it does what it does"

**Result:** Led company through crisis to $13.5 billion acquisition

**Lesson for Capstone:**
Deep analysis beats surface-level application—demonstrate genuine understanding, not just framework name-dropping

<speaker-notes>
The John Plant case illustrates the "Go Deep" dimension. He didn't just know business strategy—he understood engineering and product technology deeply enough to communicate credibly with multiple stakeholders.

For capstones, this means doing the analytical work. Don't just say "We used Hofstede's framework"—show you understand power distance scores, uncertainty avoidance, and how they specifically affect your case.

Weak capstone: "Vietnam has high power distance according to Hofstede." (Surface-level)

Strong capstone: "Vietnam scores 70 on power distance, meaning hierarchical communication is expected. This explains why our flat-structure proposal failed—it violated cultural expectations. Our revised approach maintains hierarchy in formal communications while building informal peer networks." (Deep understanding with application)

The difference is demonstrating you've done the thinking, not just repeated the framework.

<slide number="31" title="Case Study - Ed Bastian">

## Case Study: Learning Agility

**Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines**

**Challenge:** Leading through COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented uncertainty
- Business model disrupted overnight
- Required rapid learning and communication pivots

**Approach:** "The way you deal with this uncertainty is you learn, learn, learn"
- Constant information gathering from multiple sources
- Transparent communication about what he knew and didn't know

**Result:** Delta emerged as industry leader through crisis

**Lesson for Capstone:**
Acknowledge what you don't know—authentic uncertainty beats false confidence

<speaker-notes>
The Ed Bastian case is particularly relevant for students. He succeeded not by pretending to have all answers, but by being honest about uncertainty while demonstrating learning agility.

For capstones, this means acknowledging limitations in your analysis. Don't try to fake expertise you don't have.

Weak capstone: Makes sweeping claims without evidence, ignores contradictory data, presents false certainty.

Strong capstone: "Our analysis suggests X, based on Y evidence. However, we identified three limitations: [1, 2, 3]. If we had more time/data, we would investigate Z. Despite these limitations, we're confident in our core recommendations because..."

That kind of honest, rigorous thinking demonstrates professional maturity. It shows you know the difference between what you know and what you're assuming.

<slide number="32" title="Capstone Self-Assessment Questions">

## Preparing for Capstone Excellence

**Before your presentation, reflect:**

**Breadth (Dimension 1):**
- Have I applied diverse frameworks appropriate to this problem?
- Can I justify why I selected these frameworks over alternatives?

**Depth (Dimension 2):**
- Can I defend every claim with evidence and reasoning?
- Have I thought through implementation challenges and counter-arguments?

**Authenticity (Dimension 3):**
- Do I genuinely care about this topic and its recommendations?
- Am I speaking to areas where I have real knowledge, or faking expertise?

**Integration:**
- Does this presentation synthesize course learning, not just repeat it?
- Have I woven frameworks together, not just listed them sequentially?

**Impact:**
- What specific action should the audience take based on my analysis?
- Is this actionable, or just interesting observations?

**Excellent capstones score high on ALL five dimensions**

<speaker-notes>
These five questions form a capstone preparation checklist. They're not abstract—they map directly to the Group Presentation rubric criteria.

Question 1 and 2 connect to "Content & Analysis" rubric criterion—framework application and depth.

Question 3 connects to "Delivery & Presence"—authentic communication.

Question 4 is unique to capstone—it's not enough to know frameworks individually, you must integrate them.

Question 5 connects to executive communication—actionability matters. Executives don't want analysis for its own sake, they want recommendations they can implement.

Suggestion: Students should use these questions when reviewing each other's practice presentations. Peer feedback based on specific criteria is more valuable than general impressions.

The tutorial could include a peer review activity where students assess draft presentations using these five questions.

<slide number="33" title="Integration vs Repetition">

## Integration vs. Repetition (Critical Distinction)

**Repetition (Weak Capstone):**
- "First we'll discuss Cialdini, then Hofstede, then Executive Presence..."
- Frameworks presented separately with forced connections
- Feels like a course summary, not new analysis
- Sequential structure: Framework 1 → Framework 2 → Framework 3

**Integration (Strong Capstone):**
- "This cross-cultural persuasion challenge requires simultaneously understanding power distance (Hofstede), establishing credibility (Executive Presence), and applying authority principle (Cialdini)..."
- Frameworks woven together to solve a specific problem
- Feels like professional consulting analysis
- Integrated structure: Problem → Multi-framework analysis → Synthesized solution

**Your capstone should demonstrate synthesis, not summarization**

<speaker-notes>
This distinction is crucial and often misunderstood. Many students think capstone means "show everything we learned." That produces a disconnected grab-bag presentation.

True synthesis means using frameworks together to analyze something you couldn't have understood with any single framework alone.

Example of integration: Analyzing Shopee's flash sale strategy requires Cialdini's scarcity principle AND Hofstede's cultural dimensions (collectivism in Southeast Asia amplifies social proof) AND visual communication theory (how countdown timers create urgency). The frameworks illuminate different facets simultaneously and interact with each other.

Example of repetition: "Slide 5 covers Cialdini. Slide 9 covers Hofstede. Slide 12 tries to connect them." That's sequential, not integrated.

Test: If you can rearrange your presentation sections without losing coherence, you're repeating, not integrating. True integration has frameworks deeply interdependent.

Tutorial activity this week should include analyzing sample presentations and identifying which demonstrate true synthesis.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="34" title="What Synthesis Looks Like">

## Example of Framework Synthesis

**Case:** Vietnamese startup pitching to American venture capitalists

**Weak Analysis (Sequential Frameworks):**
1. Cialdini section: Use authority and social proof
2. Hofstede section: Vietnam is collectivist, US is individualist
3. Pyramid Principle section: Structure argument logically
4. Conclusion: Apply all three

**Strong Analysis (Integrated Frameworks):**
"The cultural gap (Hofstede) requires modified persuasion tactics (Cialdini). American VCs expect individual founder credibility (authority), but Vietnamese culture emphasizes team harmony. Our recommendation: Lead with founder credentials (authority) while showcasing collective team expertise (adapted for US individualism). Structure using Pyramid Principle, but frame data points to emphasize individual ROI (US values) rather than community benefit (Vietnamese values)."

**The frameworks interact and modify each other—that's synthesis**

<speaker-notes>
This example demonstrates the difference between listing frameworks and synthesizing them. In the weak version, frameworks are discussed separately. In the strong version, they interact.

Key insight: Cultural context (Hofstede) changes how you apply persuasion (Cialdini). You can't just use Cialdini's principles universally—you must adapt them based on cultural dimensions. That's synthesis.

Another layer: The Pyramid Principle structure remains, but the content within that structure is shaped by both Cialdini and Hofstede. All three frameworks are operating simultaneously.

This is the level of thinking expected in excellent capstones. Students should aim for this kind of multi-framework interaction.

You could workshop this in tutorial: Give students a communication challenge and have them practice synthesizing three frameworks in one paragraph.

<slide number="35" title="Common Capstone Pitfalls">

## Common Capstone Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Framework Tourism**
- Mentioning every framework briefly without deep application
- Fix: Choose 3-4 frameworks and apply them thoroughly

**Pitfall 2: The Laundry List**
- "Here are 10 recommendations" without prioritization
- Fix: Identify 2-3 core recommendations with clear prioritization

**Pitfall 3: Missing the "So What?"**
- Interesting analysis that leads nowhere actionable
- Fix: Every analysis section should lead to specific recommendations

**Pitfall 4: Fake Integration**
- Frameworks mentioned in introduction, then never actually used in analysis
- Fix: Show frameworks in action, not just in outline

**Pitfall 5: Death by Slides**
- 50+ slides trying to cover everything
- Fix: 15-20 slides with focused argument (use appendix for details)

<speaker-notes>
These five pitfalls represent the most common ways capstones fail, even when students have learned the material.

Pitfall 1 is especially common—students think they need to mention everything. Better to apply three frameworks deeply than ten frameworks superficially.

Pitfall 2 reflects lack of strategic thinking. Executives don't want 10 equal recommendations—they want 2-3 prioritized actions with clear rationale for priority.

Pitfall 3 is the "so what?" test failure. Analysis without implications is academic exercise, not business communication.

Pitfall 4 is framework name-dropping. Students list frameworks in the introduction but then never actually use them in analysis. The frameworks should be working tools, not decorative references.

Pitfall 5 is trying to cover too much. Better a tight 15-minute presentation with clear argument than 25 minutes of scattered observations.

Students should self-assess against these five pitfalls during practice sessions.

<slide number="36" title="Capstone Success Checklist">

## Capstone Success Checklist

**Content:**
- [ ] Clear problem statement (not just topic)
- [ ] 3-4 frameworks applied deeply (not 8+ applied superficially)
- [ ] Frameworks integrated, not listed sequentially
- [ ] Evidence supports every major claim
- [ ] 2-3 prioritized recommendations (not 10+ equal suggestions)
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable and specific

**Delivery:**
- [ ] 15-20 slides (not 30+)
- [ ] Authentic enthusiasm for topic
- [ ] Prepared for Q&A (anticipated questions and practiced answers)
- [ ] Team coordination clear (if group presentation)
- [ ] Executive presence demonstrated (Week 8 principles)

**Meta:**
- [ ] Demonstrates growth across semester
- [ ] Shows synthesis, not summarization
- [ ] Reflects your genuine thinking, not generic AI output

<speaker-notes>
This checklist provides concrete criteria for capstone evaluation. Students can use this for self-assessment and peer review.

The checklist maps directly to rubric criteria, so using it ensures alignment with grading standards.

Content section emphasizes quality over quantity—deep framework application, clear recommendations, strong evidence.

Delivery section includes practical presentation skills developed throughout the course.

The meta section is crucial—capstones should reflect authentic student thinking. Using AI to generate analysis produces generic results that don't demonstrate synthesis.

Recommendation: Students should review this checklist before every practice presentation and after peer feedback. It provides a systematic quality control mechanism.

## Key Takeaways

**Today's Core Insights**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to wrap-up. We've covered substantial frameworks—now let's crystallize the essential takeaways.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="38" title="Summary">

## Today's Key Takeaways

1. **Kolb's Cycle:** Learning requires experiencing, reflecting, conceptualizing, and experimenting—complete all four stages to turn experience into expertise

2. **Schön's Practice:** Professionals develop knowing-in-action (automatic skills), reflection-in-action (real-time adjustment), and reflection-on-action (systematic improvement)

3. **Continuous Learning:** Four evidence-based strategies: Link purpose to learning, create learning-rich experiences, ask meta-questions, nurture learning teams

4. **Capstone Versatility:** Demonstrate breadth (diverse frameworks), depth (rigorous analysis), and authenticity (genuine conviction)—synthesis over summarization

5. **Problem Setting:** Define the right problem before solving it—communication failures often result from solving the wrong problem

**Meta-Takeaway:** The frameworks you've learned matter less than your capacity to keep learning

<speaker-notes>
These five takeaways map to our four lecture segments plus one overarching insight. Each is actionable—students can immediately apply them to their Executive Summary this week and Group Presentation in Week 12.

The meta-takeaway is crucial: This course has not given you all the communication knowledge you'll ever need. That would be impossible given the 44% skill change statistic. Instead, it's given you frameworks for learning AND the capacity to continue developing independently.

That capacity—learning agility, reflective practice, continuous improvement—is what distinguishes excellent communicators from adequate ones over the course of a career.

The frameworks will evolve, technology will change communication channels, but the ability to learn from experience and continuously improve remains constant.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="39" title="From Frameworks to Mindset">

## The Shift from Frameworks to Mindset

**What You've Learned:**
- Pyramid Principle, Cialdini, Hofstede, Executive Presence, Visual Communication...
- Specific techniques and frameworks

**What Really Matters:**
- The habit of asking "What communication challenge am I solving?"
- The practice of reflecting in-action and on-action
- The commitment to continuous improvement
- The ability to synthesize multiple perspectives

**Frameworks are tools. Mindset is what makes you effective.**

**Your goal after this course:** Internalize the learning mindset, not just memorize the frameworks

<speaker-notes>
This slide makes explicit what's often left implicit: frameworks are means, not ends. Students who memorize Cialdini's six principles but don't develop reflective practice will plateau.

The shift from frameworks to mindset is the shift from novice to expert. Experts have internalized frameworks so deeply they become automatic (knowing-in-action), while maintaining conscious reflection and continuous improvement.

Example: A novice presenter thinks "I need to use Pyramid Principle here." An expert presenter naturally structures arguments that way while simultaneously reflecting on whether Pyramid Principle is the right approach for this specific audience and context.

This connects to all four segments today: Kolb's cycle (learning mindset), Schön's practice (reflective mindset), continuous development (growth mindset), and capstone excellence (synthesis mindset).

The message: Take the frameworks with you, but more importantly, take the meta-skill of learning how to learn.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="40" title="Assessment Preparation">

## This Week's Assessments

**Executive Summary (Due Sunday Week 10):**
- Demonstrate synthesis: distill complex information into clear recommendations
- Apply relevant frameworks (not all frameworks—select strategically)
- Show reflective practice: acknowledge trade-offs and limitations
- Target: 2-page maximum (test of efficiency and clarity)

**Preparation Strategy:**
1. Define the core problem (problem setting, not just problem solving)
2. Select 2-3 most relevant frameworks
3. Integrate frameworks in analysis (synthesis, not sequential application)
4. Develop prioritized recommendations (2-3 max)
5. Acknowledge limitations honestly

<speaker-notes>
Concrete preparation guidance. The Executive Summary is your final written assessment—treat it as an opportunity to demonstrate everything you've learned about clear, strategic, efficient communication.

Key insight: You don't need to use every framework learned in the course. Strategic selection of relevant frameworks demonstrates better judgment than trying to force everything in.

The 2-page limit is deliberate—it tests your ability to communicate efficiently, a core executive skill. Every sentence must earn its place.

The five-step preparation strategy provides a systematic approach. Students should literally follow these steps in order when developing their Executive Summary.

This connects to today's content: Step 1 is Schön's problem setting. Steps 2-3 apply Kolb's conceptualization and integration. Step 4 requires synthesis. Step 5 demonstrates professional maturity and authentic communication.

<slide number="41" title="Quiz Preparation">

## Week 11 Quiz Preparation

**Format:**
- 30-minute comprehensive assessment
- Covers all frameworks from Weeks 1-10
- Mix of concept identification and application questions

**Preparation Strategy:**

1. **Review frameworks systematically:** Don't just re-read slides—test yourself
   - Can you explain each framework without looking?
   - Can you apply each framework to a new scenario?

2. **Focus on WHY, not just WHAT:**
   - Don't memorize: "Cialdini has 6 principles"
   - Do understand: "Why does reciprocity create persuasion?"

3. **Practice application:** Use tutorial quiz questions from each week
   - Same format as final quiz
   - Builds pattern recognition

4. **Identify connections:** Which frameworks work together?
   - Example: Hofstede + Cialdini, Pyramid Principle + Executive Presence

<speaker-notes>
The quiz tests understanding and application, not just recall. Students who can apply frameworks to new scenarios will excel. Students who only memorized definitions will struggle.

The "WHY not WHAT" distinction is crucial. Understanding the psychological or theoretical basis for frameworks enables application to new contexts.

Using tutorial quiz questions for practice is strategic—they're in the same format and difficulty level as the final quiz. Students can diagnose gaps in understanding.

The connections question prepares students for synthesis questions on the quiz. Some questions may require integrating multiple frameworks, testing ability to see relationships.

Recommendation: Students should form study groups and quiz each other. Teaching frameworks to peers is one of the best ways to solidify understanding.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="42" title="Group Presentation Preparation">

## Week 12 Group Presentation Preparation

**Start Planning Now:**

**Week 10 (This Week):**
- [ ] Confirm team and communication challenge to analyze
- [ ] Identify which 3-4 frameworks are most relevant
- [ ] Assign research and analysis responsibilities

**Week 11 (Next Week):**
- [ ] Complete analysis and draft slides
- [ ] Practice presentation as team (at least twice)
- [ ] Seek peer feedback using Capstone Success Checklist

**Week 12 (Presentation Week):**
- [ ] Final refinements based on feedback
- [ ] Individual preparation (know your sections cold)
- [ ] Anticipate Q&A and prepare answers

**Critical Success Factor:** Practice early and often—presentation excellence requires iteration

<speaker-notes>
This timeline provides concrete milestones. Most successful presentations follow this schedule. Most struggling presentations started too late.

The Week 10 tasks are foundational—selecting topic and frameworks. This should happen this week, not next week. Delaying means inadequate analysis time.

Week 11 is intensive preparation—drafting, practicing, getting feedback. Two practice runs minimum, ideally three or four. Each practice reveals issues to fix.

Week 12 is refinement, not creation. If you're still writing slides in Week 12, you're behind.

The critical success factor—practice and iteration—cannot be overstated. The difference between good and excellent presentations is usually preparation time and iteration cycles.

Students should calendar specific practice times now. If it's not scheduled, it won't happen.

Recommendation: Use the tutorial session in Week 11 for peer feedback on draft presentations. Groups can rotate giving 2-minute elevator pitches of their analysis and receiving feedback.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="43" title="Next Week Preview">

## Next Week: Review & Assessment

**What to expect:**

**Lecture:**
- Comprehensive review of all frameworks (Weeks 1-10)
- Focus on connections and integration
- Final Q&A for quiz preparation

**Tutorial:**
- Quiz (30 minutes, 15% of final grade)
- Group presentation coaching (feedback on draft plans)
- Final office hours for questions

**Preparation:**
- Review all weekly lecture slides systematically
- Complete practice quiz questions
- Prepare specific questions (not "tell me about Cialdini"—ask targeted questions)
- Bring draft presentation outline for feedback

<speaker-notes>
Next week is dedicated to consolidation and assessment. The lecture will be a structured review covering all major frameworks in sequence, with emphasis on how they connect and integrate.

The tutorial quiz is comprehensive—it covers all 10 weeks of content. Students should prepare systematically, not cram the night before.

The presentation coaching is valuable—groups can get feedback on their analysis approach and framework selection before committing to slides.

The guidance about "specific questions" is important. Generic requests like "review Cialdini" aren't efficient use of class time. Specific questions like "We're analyzing cross-cultural negotiation—should we emphasize Hofstede's power distance or uncertainty avoidance?" get actionable answers.

Students should arrive prepared to maximize the review session value.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="44" title="Final Reflection">

## Your Communication Journey

**Reflection Prompt (Personal, Not Graded):**

Think back to Week 1. How has your understanding of "communication competence" changed?

1. **Surprise:** What surprised you most about what makes communication effective?

2. **Impact:** Which framework has influenced your thinking most profoundly?

3. **Pride:** What communication capability are you most proud of developing?

4. **Future:** What will you continue working on after this course ends?

**Write these down for yourself—they'll inform your capstone narrative and development plan**

<speaker-notes>
This reflection prompt serves two purposes: personal awareness and capstone preparation. Students who've consciously tracked their journey have much richer material for presentations.

These aren't graded—this is purely for personal reflection. However, you could invite 2-3 volunteers to share one insight if time permits. Hearing peer reflections often sparks additional insights.

Question 1 (surprise) often reveals misconceptions students had at the start. Many are surprised that effective communication is strategic, not just "being clear."

Question 2 (impact) helps students identify which frameworks resonated personally. This varies—some students love Cialdini, others connect deeply with Hofstede.

Question 3 (pride) builds confidence. Students often underestimate their own growth. Explicitly naming what they've developed reinforces competence.

Question 4 (future) connects to Strategy 3 (meta-learning questions) and positions communication development as ongoing, not finished when the course ends.

This is an appropriate moment of pause before the final assessments.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="45" title="Closing Thoughts">

## Closing Thoughts

**What Communication Competence Really Means:**

Not the ability to deliver a perfect presentation

Not mastering every framework in business communication

Not sounding impressive with sophisticated vocabulary

**But rather:**

- The **curiosity** to understand your audience deeply
- The **humility** to reflect on what's working and what isn't
- The **courage** to speak up when you have something valuable to contribute
- The **discipline** to improve continuously throughout your career

**These meta-skills will serve you long after specific frameworks fade from memory**

**Thank you for your engagement this semester. You're ready for what comes next.**

<speaker-notes>
This closing reframes communication competence from technical skill to professional mindset. The four qualities—curiosity, humility, courage, discipline—integrate all of today's frameworks.

Curiosity connects to Kolb's learning cycle and continuous development.

Humility connects to Schön's reflective practice and McKinsey's authentic communication.

Courage connects to "knowing when to speak up" and executive presence.

Discipline connects to the four MIT Sloan strategies and systematic improvement.

The message: You're not finished learning communication—you're equipped to continue learning. That's what this course has provided.

The final line—"You're ready for what comes next"—is both encouragement and challenge. Students are prepared for capstone presentations and, more broadly, for professional communication challenges in their careers.

This is a moment to pause and let the message land before transitioning to the references slide.
