# Week 4 Tutorial: Persuasive Written Communication

**Course:** BCI2AU Business Communication
**Assessment Connection:** Business Memo DUE this week (10%) | Begins Persuasive Proposal prep (15%, due Week 7)

---

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Rhetorical Appeals (Aristotle):** Three modes of persuasion—Ethos (credibility/character), Pathos (emotion/values), Logos (logic/evidence). Effective persuasion uses all three strategically.

- **The Pyramid Principle (Minto):** Organize ideas hierarchically—main recommendation at the apex, supporting reasons below, evidence at the base. Start with the answer, not the background.

- **SCQA Framework:** Four-part opening structure—Situation (context reader knows), Complication (what changed), Question (explicit issue), Answer (your recommendation). Creates engagement before presenting your solution.

- **Problem-Solution-Benefit Structure:** Frame persuasive proposals by establishing the problem clearly, presenting a specific solution, and demonstrating tangible benefits with evidence.

- **Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence:** Reciprocity, Commitment & Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity. Ethical persuasion techniques that trigger psychological responses.

**What good work looks like:**

- Opening paragraph establishes credibility (ethos) while creating emotional connection (pathos)
- Rhetorical appeals are balanced—not relying only on emotion or only on data
- Clear problem statement with supporting evidence
- Specific, actionable solution with implementation details
- Tangible benefits quantified where possible
- Professional tone maintained with active voice

## Main Activity: Persuasive Opening Paragraph

**Assessment Connection:** Persuasive Proposal (Due Week 7) - this activity begins proposal preparation by practicing persuasive openings and rhetorical appeals

**The Task:**

Draft a persuasive opening paragraph (150-200 words) for a business proposal using rhetorical appeals. This opening could become the executive summary or introduction of your full proposal in Week 7.

You will practice establishing credibility (ethos), creating emotional resonance (pathos), and presenting logical arguments (logos) in a concise, compelling opening that makes decision-makers want to read more.

**Deliverable:**

150-200 word opening paragraph that:
- Identifies a clear business problem
- Establishes your credibility to propose a solution
- Creates urgency or emotional connection to the issue
- Hints at your solution (full details come in body of proposal)
- Uses all three rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos) identifiably

**Success Criteria:** (from Persuasive Proposal Rubric)

- **Persuasive Strategy (30%):** Effective use of rhetorical appeals—ethos (credibility established), pathos (values/emotions engaged), logos (logical reasoning evident)
- **Professional Writing (15%):** Clear, concise, appropriate tone; opening creates engagement
- **Content & Evidence (25%):** Problem is real and significant; evidence supports the need for action

**Resources:**

**Scenario (choose ONE similar to Assessment Handbook options):**

**Option A: Sustainability Initiative Practice**
You are proposing a company-wide initiative to reduce single-use plastic in your office by 60% over one year. Write the opening paragraph requesting $8,000 implementation budget from the Sustainability Committee.
- Company currently generates 500kg plastic waste monthly
- Employee survey shows 78% support sustainability efforts
- Local competitors have achieved similar reductions

**Option B: Technology Upgrade Practice**
You are proposing adoption of a new collaboration platform for your 50-person department. Write the opening paragraph requesting approval and $15,000 budget from senior leadership.
- Current system is 6 years old with frequent complaints
- Remote work has increased 40% post-pandemic
- Three competitor companies use modern solutions

**Option C: Training Program Practice**
You are proposing a professional development program for junior staff. Write the opening paragraph requesting $12,000 annual investment from HR leadership.
- Department has 25% turnover among junior staff
- Exit interviews cite "lack of growth opportunities"
- Industry data shows training ROI of 150%+

**Framework Reference:**
- Rhetorical Appeals (Lecture Slide 15)
- Problem-Solution-Benefit structure (Lecture Slide 18)
- Pyramid Principle (Lecture Slide 7)

**Work Process:**

1. **Choose your scenario** (5 min)
2. **Outline your appeals** (10 min):
   - How will you establish ethos (credibility)?
   - What pathos (emotion/values) will resonate?
   - What logos (data/logic) supports your case?
3. **Draft your opening paragraph** (30 min):
   - Start with the problem (Situation/Complication)
   - Establish why you're qualified to propose solutions (Ethos)
   - Connect to shared values or concerns (Pathos)
   - Reference data that shows need (Logos)
   - Hint at your solution
4. **Self-review** (10 min):
   - Circle where you used ethos, pathos, logos
   - Check word count (150-200)
   - Read aloud—does it flow naturally?

**Class Feedback:**

At the end of the session, 4-6 students will share their opening paragraphs. Be prepared to:
- Read your paragraph aloud (150-200 words = ~60 seconds)
- Identify where you used ethos, pathos, and logos
- Explain which appeal you think is strongest in your draft
- Answer one question from peers

⚠️ **Participation:** You must produce a complete opening paragraph to share. This deliverable is the foundation for your Week 7 Persuasive Proposal. Save your work.
