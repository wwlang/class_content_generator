## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to:

1. **Apply** rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos) to persuasive business openings
2. **Draft** a compelling opening paragraph that establishes credibility, creates urgency, and presents logical need
3. **Identify** where rhetorical appeals appear in their own and peers' writing
4. **Articulate** persuasive writing choices using course terminology

## Valid Student Approaches

This is a creative persuasive writing exercise—there is **no single "right" opening**. Valid approaches include:

### Approach 1: Ethos-First Opening
- Establishes writer's credibility or expertise immediately
- Builds trust before presenting problem
- Strong for proposals where credibility is key concern
- Example: "As the Sustainability Coordinator for the past three years, I've tracked our environmental impact across 12 metrics..."

### Approach 2: Pathos-First Opening
- Opens with emotional appeal, shared values, or compelling narrative
- Creates human connection before data
- Strong for proposals involving people, culture, or values
- Example: "Every Monday, our janitorial team hauls 500kg of single-use plastic to the landfill—waste we could eliminate while saving money and demonstrating corporate responsibility..."

### Approach 3: Logos-First Opening
- Opens with striking data, problem statement, or logical argument
- Appeals to reason and evidence immediately
- Strong for analytical audiences (CFOs, engineers, data-driven leaders)
- Example: "Our department's 25% turnover rate costs the company $180,000 annually in recruitment and lost productivity—a problem we can solve with a $12,000 training investment..."

### Approach 4: Problem-Urgency Opening
- Establishes problem and urgency before solution
- Uses SCQA structure (Situation → Complication)
- Strong for time-sensitive proposals
- Example: "While we debate collaboration tools, our competitors have moved to modern platforms, reducing project timelines by 30%. We're losing talent to companies with better technology..."

### Approach 5: Balanced Triple-Appeal Opening
- Weaves all three appeals throughout the paragraph
- No single appeal dominates
- Strong for complex, high-stakes proposals
- Example: "As IT Manager [ethos], I've watched our 6-year-old system frustrate 50 employees daily [pathos]. Downtime costs us 120 hours monthly—$18,000 in lost productivity [logos]..."

**Key Point:** Students should choose an appeal sequence that matches their audience and topic. A proposal to HR might emphasize pathos (employee wellbeing), while a proposal to Finance might emphasize logos (ROI data).

---

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Pathos means being emotional or dramatic"
**Reality:** Pathos connects to values, not just emotions. It can be subtle—appealing to shared goals, corporate values, team identity, or professional pride.

**Tutor Response:** "Pathos doesn't require dramatic emotion. Try connecting to shared values: 'We all want to retain talented staff' or 'Our company values sustainability.' That's pathos—shared priorities."

---

### Misconception 2: "I need equal space for all three appeals"
**Reality:** Rhetorical appeals can be balanced or weighted differently based on audience. A data-driven audience needs more logos; a values-driven audience needs more pathos.

**Tutor Response:** "You've dedicated 80% of your paragraph to data. That's fine if your audience is analytical. Just make sure ethos and pathos are present, even if brief."

---

### Misconception 3: "Ethos is bragging about myself"
**Reality:** Ethos establishes credibility through experience, expertise, research, or stakeholder consultation. It can be humble: "After consulting with 10 department heads..." or "Based on industry research..."

**Tutor Response:** "Ethos isn't bragging. You can establish credibility by showing you've done research, consulted stakeholders, or analyzed data. Try: 'After surveying 50 employees, I identified...'"

---

### Misconception 4: "Logos means using lots of numbers"
**Reality:** Logos is logical reasoning, not just data. It includes cause-effect relationships, comparisons, evidence-based arguments, and rational structure.

**Tutor Response:** "Logos isn't just numbers—it's logical reasoning. Your argument 'If we don't act now, we'll lose competitive advantage' is logos. Add one data point to strengthen it."

---

### Misconception 5: "The opening should give the full solution"
**Reality:** The opening paragraph hooks the reader and hints at the solution. Full details come in the proposal body. Think of it as a trailer, not the full movie.

**Tutor Response:** "Your opening explains the entire solution in detail. Save that for the proposal body. In your opening, hint at the solution: 'I propose a targeted training program...' then move on. Details come later."

---

### Misconception 6: "Rhetorical appeals are separate sentences"
**Reality:** Appeals can be woven together in a single sentence. Example: "As Sustainability Coordinator [ethos], I've watched us discard 500kg of plastic monthly [pathos], costing $2,000 in waste fees [logos]."

**Tutor Response:** "You've separated your appeals into three distinct sentences. That works, but try weaving them together for a smoother flow. Look at this example..."

## Facilitation Guidance

### Phase 1: Quick Review (5 min)

**Objective:** Ensure students understand rhetorical appeals before drafting.

**What to do:**
- Ask: "Who can explain ethos in one sentence?" (Credibility/character)
- Ask: "Who can explain pathos in one sentence?" (Emotion/values)
- Ask: "Who can explain logos in one sentence?" (Logic/evidence)
- Display success criteria from Assessment Handbook (Persuasive Strategy rubric)

**Check understanding:**
- "In your Business Memo, which appeal did you use most? Which was hardest?"
- "Why do you think all three appeals are needed for persuasion?"

**Vietnamese cultural note:** Some students may associate rhetoric with manipulation. Clarify: "Rhetorical appeals are ethical persuasion tools used by professionals worldwide. They help decision-makers understand why your proposal deserves approval."

---

### Phase 2: Choose Scenario + Outline Appeals (15 min)

**Objective:** Students select a scenario and plan which appeals to use.

**What to do:**
- Present three scenario options (Sustainability, Technology, Training)
- Ask students to choose ONE based on interest or experience
- Provide outlining time:
  - How will you establish ethos?
  - What pathos will resonate with your audience?
  - What logos supports your case?

**Guiding questions to ask while circulating:**
- "Who is your audience for this proposal?" (Helps them tailor appeals)
- "What credibility do you bring to this topic?" (Ethos)
- "What does your audience care about—cost savings, employee wellbeing, competitive advantage?" (Pathos)
- "What data or evidence do you have?" (Logos)

**Common challenges:**

1. **Student can't identify ethos:**
   - Ask: "What experience, research, or consultation makes you qualified to propose this?"
   - Suggest: "You could say 'After analyzing competitor practices...' or 'Based on employee feedback...'"

2. **Student thinks pathos requires emotional manipulation:**
   - Clarify: "Pathos is about shared values. What does your audience care about? Sustainability? Employee retention? Competitive advantage? Connect to that."

3. **Student has no data for logos:**
   - Provide realistic placeholders: "For this practice, you can use plausible estimates: 'Estimated cost savings of $10K' or 'Industry studies show 150% ROI.' In your real proposal, you'll research actual figures."

**Vietnamese cultural note:** Vietnamese students may feel uncomfortable with self-promotion (ethos). Emphasize: "In Western business writing, establishing credibility is professional, not arrogant. It helps readers trust your recommendation."

---

### Phase 3: Draft Opening Paragraph (30 min)

**Objective:** Students write 150-200 word persuasive openings using rhetorical appeals.

**What to do:**
- Students write independently
- Circulate actively—this is prime teaching time
- Ask guiding questions rather than writing for them
- Help students who are stuck on structure or word choice

**Guiding questions:**
- "Where in your draft do you establish credibility?" (Ethos check)
- "What emotional or values-based appeal do you make?" (Pathos check)
- "What data or logical reasoning supports your argument?" (Logos check)
- "Is your problem statement clear and urgent?"

**Common drafting challenges:**

1. **Student's opening is too vague:**
   - Ask: "What specifically is the problem? Instead of 'communication issues,' what's the measurable impact—meetings run 30 minutes over? Emails misunderstood 40% of the time?"

2. **Student's opening is too detailed:**
   - Ask: "You've explained the entire solution. What if you just hint at it here? 'I propose a three-phase training program...' then stop. Details come in the proposal body."

3. **Student can't hit 150-200 words:**
   - Too short: "Can you add one sentence explaining why this matters to your audience?"
   - Too long: "Which sentence could you cut without losing essential information?"

4. **Student relies on only one appeal:**
   - "I see strong logos (data). Where's your ethos? How do you establish credibility? And what pathos connects to audience values?"

**Vietnamese cultural note:** Vietnamese students may write overly formal, passive constructions ("It is proposed that..."). Encourage active voice: "I propose..." or "This initiative will..." Business writing values directness.

---

### Phase 4: Self-Review (10 min)

**Objective:** Students evaluate their own drafts before sharing.

**What to do:**
- Ask students to:
  - Circle or highlight where they used ethos (one color)
  - Circle or highlight where they used pathos (another color)
  - Circle or highlight where they used logos (third color)
  - Check word count (150-200)
  - Read aloud to themselves (catches awkward phrasing)

**What to look for while circulating:**
- Students who can't identify all three appeals (help them find or add missing ones)
- Students who misidentify appeals (teach the distinction)
- Students who exceeded word count significantly (ask them to cut unnecessary words)

**Intervention examples:**
- "You circled this sentence as pathos, but it's actually logos (data). Pathos would be connecting to shared values—try adding 'our commitment to sustainability' or 'our responsibility to employees.'"
- "I don't see ethos anywhere. Where do you establish credibility? Add one phrase: 'Based on my analysis of...' or 'After consulting with...'"

---

### Phase 5: Peer Exchange (Optional, 10 min)

**Objective:** Quick peer feedback if time allows.

**What to do:**
- Pair students
- Each reads partner's paragraph
- Identify: Which appeal is strongest? Which is weakest or missing?
- Suggest: One sentence to strengthen the weakest appeal

**This phase is OPTIONAL:** If time is tight, skip to Class Feedback. The self-review is sufficient for individual learning.

---

### Phase 6: Class Feedback (10 min)

**Objective:** Highlight effective use of rhetorical appeals through peer examples.

**What to do:**
- Select 4-6 students to share (or ask for volunteers)
- Ask them to:
  - Read their paragraph aloud
  - Identify where they used ethos, pathos, logos
  - Explain which appeal they think is strongest
- Invite 1-2 questions from class per sharer

**Selection criteria:**
- Diverse scenarios (at least one from each option)
- Diverse appeal strengths (ethos-first, pathos-first, logos-first, balanced)
- Mix of strong and developing writers (praise improvement and effort, not just perfection)

**Example facilitation:**
- Student reads paragraph. Ask class: "Raise your hand when you hear ethos. Raise your hand when you hear pathos. Raise your hand when you hear logos."
- Student finishes. Ask: "Which appeal do you think was strongest here? Why?"
- If student's paragraph is missing an appeal: "This has strong logos and ethos. How could we add pathos? What shared value could we connect to?"

**What to praise:**
- Clear identification of appeals ("Great job circling where you used each appeal—that shows strategic thinking")
- Strong problem statements ("Your opening makes the problem urgent and specific")
- Natural integration of appeals ("You wove ethos, pathos, and logos together smoothly—not forced or choppy")
- Professional tone ("This sounds confident and credible—exactly the tone for a proposal")

**Vietnamese cultural note:** Some students may be shy about reading aloud. If no volunteers, select students you've already spoken to during drafting (they'll be prepared). Frame it positively: "I noticed your strong use of ethos during drafting—can you share with the class?"

---

### Phase 7: Before Next Class (10 min)

**What to do:**
- **Remind:** Week 4 Quiz due Sunday 11:59 PM on Moodle
- **CRITICAL:** Business Memo final submission deadline Sunday 11:59 PM, Week 4
- **Save Work:** Keep today's persuasive opening paragraph—it can become your Week 7 Proposal introduction or executive summary
- Emphasize: "This 150-200 word opening is practice for your Persuasive Proposal due Week 7. You've just drafted the hardest part—the persuasive hook. Build on this over the next few weeks."

## Rhetorical Appeals Quick Reference (for Tutors)

### Ethos (Credibility/Character)
**What it is:** Establishing trustworthiness, expertise, or authority
**In proposals:**
- "As [job title], I have..."
- "After consulting with [experts/stakeholders]..."
- "Based on industry research..."
- "My analysis of [data/reports] shows..."

**Example:** "As Sustainability Coordinator for three years, I've tracked our environmental metrics across 12 categories."

---

### Pathos (Emotion/Values)
**What it is:** Connecting to audience's values, priorities, or shared goals
**In proposals:**
- "We all value [sustainability/employee wellbeing/competitive advantage]..."
- "Our commitment to [shared value] requires..."
- "Imagine if we could [positive outcome]..."
- Human stories, vivid descriptions, shared concerns

**Example:** "Our janitorial team hauls 500kg of plastic waste weekly—waste we could eliminate while honoring our sustainability commitment."

---

### Logos (Logic/Evidence)
**What it is:** Rational arguments, data, cause-effect reasoning, evidence
**In proposals:**
- Statistics, percentages, dollar amounts
- Industry benchmarks, case studies, research findings
- Cause-effect relationships ("If X, then Y")
- Comparisons, ROI calculations

**Example:** "Our 25% turnover rate costs $180,000 annually—a problem solvable with a $12,000 training investment yielding 1500% ROI."

---

## Vietnamese Cultural Considerations

### Direct vs. Indirect Persuasion
- **Challenge:** Vietnamese culture may favor indirect requests and relationship-building before persuasion
- **Solution:** Explain cultural differences: "In Vietnamese culture, indirect requests show respect. In Western business writing, direct proposals show respect for the reader's time. Both are valid in their contexts. For this course, practice Western business norms."

### Establishing Credibility (Ethos)
- **Challenge:** Vietnamese students may view establishing credentials as immodest or boastful
- **Solution:** Reframe: "Ethos isn't bragging—it's helping your reader understand why they should trust your recommendation. In business, decision-makers want to know you've done research, consulted stakeholders, or have relevant experience."

### Emotional Appeals (Pathos)
- **Challenge:** Some students may associate emotion with unprofessionalism
- **Solution:** Clarify: "Pathos isn't about being emotional—it's about connecting to shared values. Saying 'Our company values sustainability' is pathos. So is 'We all want to retain talented staff.' It's professional and persuasive."

### Formality and Passive Voice
- **Challenge:** Vietnamese students often use formal, passive constructions
- **Solution:** Provide side-by-side examples:
  - Formal: "It is proposed that an initiative be undertaken..."
  - Business: "I propose a sustainability initiative..."
  - Both are grammatically correct, but business writing values active, direct language.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Student didn't choose a scenario
**Response:** "Let's pick one together based on your interests. Do you care about environment (sustainability), technology (collaboration tools), or people development (training)?"
**Quick solution:** Assign scenario based on their major or career interests.

---

### Issue: Student's opening doesn't use all three appeals
**Intervene:** "I see strong logos here. Where's your ethos—how do you establish credibility? And what pathos connects to your audience's values?"
**Provide scaffolding:** "Try adding one sentence: 'As [your role], I've [experience]' for ethos. And 'We all value [shared goal]' for pathos."

---

### Issue: Student's opening is 250+ words
**Response:** "Your draft is strong, but it's 80 words over the limit. Which sentences are essential? Which could you cut or combine?"
**Teach concision:** "Try the 8 S's principle from the lecture—Simplicity. Can you say this in fewer words? 'Facilitate improved efficiency' becomes 'improve efficiency' (-2 words)."

---

### Issue: Student finishes early and seems bored
**Response:** "Great—you're done early. Now revise: Can you strengthen your weakest appeal? Can you add one more piece of data (logos)? Can you make your pathos more compelling?"
**Extension task:** "Try rewriting your opening using a different appeal order—start with pathos instead of ethos. Which version is more persuasive?"

---

### Issue: Student is stuck and can't start writing
**Ask probing questions:**
- "What's the problem you're trying to solve?"
- "Why should your audience care?"
- "What makes you qualified to propose this?"
**Provide a template:** "Try this structure: '[Problem statement]. As [your role], I've [evidence of expertise]. [Data showing urgency]. I propose [hint at solution]."

---

### Issue: Time runs short
**Priority cuts:**
- Skip Peer Exchange (optional phase)
- Reduce Class Feedback to 3 sharers at 90 seconds each
- **Do NOT cut drafting time**—that's the core learning activity

---

## Success Indicators

**You'll know the tutorial is working if:**
- Students can identify ethos, pathos, and logos in their own writing
- Opening paragraphs make clear, urgent problem statements
- Drafts use all three appeals (even if imperfectly)
- Students articulate persuasive choices using course terminology ("I used logos here by citing ROI data")
- Class Feedback shows diverse appeal strategies (not all identical approaches)

**Red flags to address:**
- Students confuse the three appeals (teach the distinctions)
- Openings are vague or lack urgency (prompt for specificity)
- Only one appeal present (guide students to add missing appeals)
- Excessive word count (teach concision)
- Passive, overly formal tone (model active voice alternatives)
