    topic: "The Pyramid Principle"

    question: |
      What are the three levels of the Pyramid Principle structure?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Main recommendation at apex, supporting reasons in middle, evidence at base"
        feedback: "Correct! The Pyramid organizes ideas hierarchically from conclusion to supporting evidence."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Introduction at top, body paragraphs in middle, conclusion at base"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is traditional essay structure, not the Pyramid Principle."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Executive summary at apex, background in middle, recommendations at base"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Pyramid puts the recommendation first, not the executive summary."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Analysis at top, methodology in middle, raw data at base"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Pyramid focuses on conclusions and supporting logic, not research methodology."

    general_feedback: |
      The Pyramid Principle uses a **hierarchical** (organized in levels from top to bottom) structure with your main recommendation at the apex, supporting reasons in the middle layer, and detailed evidence at the base. This structure reflects how busy executives read—they need the answer first, then supporting reasons. See Week 4 slides 7-10.

    topic: "The Pyramid Principle"

    question: |
      How does the Pyramid Principle differ from traditional academic writing structures?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Pyramid places the main conclusion first; academic writing places it last"
        feedback: "Correct! Business writing needs the answer immediately for busy readers. Academic writing builds to a conclusion."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Pyramid uses more evidence than academic writing"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both use evidence; they differ in where the conclusion appears."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Pyramid is used for emails; academic writing is for reports"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Pyramid applies to all business documents—memos, reports, proposals."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Pyramid is shorter than academic writing"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Length varies by document type; the difference is structural placement of conclusions."

    general_feedback: |
      Traditional academic writing builds suspense by presenting evidence first and conclusion last. The Pyramid Principle reverses this: state your recommendation first, then provide supporting reasons and evidence. This **structure-first** (organizing information before drafting) approach matches how executives with limited reading time scan documents. See Week 4 slides 6-7.

    topic: "The Pyramid Principle"

    question: |
      What is the MECE principle in the context of the Pyramid Principle?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Supporting reasons must be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive—no overlaps, nothing missing"
        feedback: "Correct! MECE ensures your reasoning is logical and complete without redundancy."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "All evidence must be Multiple, Essential, Current, and Empirical"
        feedback: "Incorrect. MECE refers to how reasons relate to each other, not data criteria."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Messages should be Memorable, Explicit, Clear, and Engaging"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are writing qualities, not the MECE principle."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Every statement must be Measurable, Evaluated, Contextualized, and Evidence-based"
        feedback: "Incorrect. MECE is specifically about non-overlapping, complete reasoning sets."

    general_feedback: |
      MECE stands for **Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive** — meaning reasons must not overlap (mutually exclusive) and must cover the complete argument (collectively exhaustive). For example, if recommending budget approval, three reasons might be: "improves efficiency," "reduces risk," "aligns with strategy." Each is distinct; together they fully justify the decision. Using MECE prevents weak arguments and logical gaps. See Week 4 slides 7.

    topic: "SCQA Framework"

    question: |
      What does SCQA stand for?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Situation, Complication, Question, Answer"
        feedback: "Correct! SCQA is a four-part introduction structure that engages readers before presenting your main recommendation."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Summary, Context, Query, Assessment"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these are similar concepts, they are not what SCQA stands for."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Structure, Clarity, Quality, Argument"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SCQA refers to the narrative opening sequence, not writing principles."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Solution, Circumstance, Question, Analysis"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The correct order is Situation, Complication, Question, Answer."

    general_feedback: |
      SCQA is an acronym for a four-part introduction framework: **Situation** (undisputed facts), **Complication** (what has changed or what's the problem), **Question** (explicit issue to address), and **Answer** (your solution/recommendation). SCQA creates an engaging **narrative engagement** (drawing readers into a compelling story) before you present your main argument. See Week 4 slides 8-9.

  - id: "W4-Q5-scqa-situation-component"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SCQA Framework"

    question: |
      How does the "Situation" component of SCQA differ from the "Complication" component?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Situation presents undisputed facts the reader already knows; Complication introduces the problem or change"
        feedback: "Correct! Situation builds agreement and context; Complication creates urgency by introducing tension."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Situation is brief; Complication is lengthy"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Length varies by memo type; the difference is content focus, not length."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Situation is your recommendation; Complication is your evidence"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Situation = background context, Complication = problem/change, Answer = recommendation."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Situation explains the past; Complication explains the present and future"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Situation provides current facts; Complication explains a change or problem that exists now."

    general_feedback: |
      The Situation component establishes undisputed facts and context the reader already accepts—this builds **common ground** (shared understanding between writer and reader). The Complication introduces what has changed, what's going wrong, or why action is needed now. Together, they create narrative flow: "Here's what we all agree on (S), but here's what's changed (C), so we need to address this (Q), and here's how (A)." See Week 4 slides 8-9.

    topic: "SCQA Framework"

    question: |
      What role does the "Answer" component play in the SCQA framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "It restates your main recommendation—this becomes the apex of your Pyramid structure"
        feedback: "Correct! The Answer in SCQA is the conclusion to your opening narrative and the top of your Pyramid."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "It provides detailed evidence supporting your position"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Evidence appears in the Pyramid base, not in the SCQA Answer."

      - key: "C"
        text: "It summarizes what the reader should already know"
        feedback: "Incorrect. That's the Situation. The Answer is your proposed solution."

      - key: "D"
        text: "It explains why the problem exists"
        feedback: "Incorrect. That's the Complication. The Answer tells the reader what to do about the problem."

    general_feedback: |
      The Answer in SCQA is your main recommendation or solution—the "so what" and "now what" your reader needs to know. It directly becomes the apex (top) of your Pyramid Principle structure. After SCQA establishes **engagement** (capturing reader interest and attention), your three supporting reasons in Pyramid structure prove why the Answer is correct. See Week 4 slides 8-9.

    topic: "Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence"

    question: |
      Which of the following correctly lists four of Cialdini's Six Principles?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Reciprocity, Commitment & Consistency, Social Proof, Authority"
        feedback: "Correct! These are four of the six principles. The other two are Liking and Scarcity."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Reciprocity, Emotion, Data, Authority"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'Emotion' and 'Data' are not Cialdini principles; 'Social Proof' is one of the six."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Reciprocity, Simplicity, Logic, Trust"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These mix writing principles (Simplicity) with psychology concepts. Cialdini's actual principles are specific."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Commitment, Urgency, Credibility, Liking"
        feedback: "Incorrect. 'Urgency' and 'Credibility' aren't Cialdini principles. 'Scarcity' and 'Authority' are the correct principles."

    general_feedback: |
      Cialdini's Six Principles are: Reciprocity, Commitment & Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, and Scarcity. These are **empirical** (based on experiments and evidence rather than opinion) psychological triggers that increase compliance and persuasion. Each principle is grounded in 35+ years of research and applies to business writing, sales, negotiation, and marketing. See Week 4 slide 13.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence"

    question: |
      How do the principles of Reciprocity and Scarcity differ in persuasive communication?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Reciprocity gives value first to obligate others; Scarcity emphasizes limited availability to increase perceived value"
        feedback: "Correct! Reciprocity is about returning favors; Scarcity is about time/resource pressure."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Reciprocity uses data; Scarcity uses emotional appeals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both can use data or emotion. The difference is in mechanism: obligation vs. limitation."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Reciprocity is for sales; Scarcity is for negotiations"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both apply to all forms of persuasive communication—memos, proposals, emails."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Reciprocity mentions competition; Scarcity mentions past agreements"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Reciprocity references past favors; Scarcity references deadlines and limited opportunities."

    general_feedback: |
      **Reciprocity** operates on obligation—when you provide value first (information, help, a favor), people feel compelled to return it. **Scarcity** operates on urgency—limited availability or tight deadlines make offers seem more valuable. In business writing, Reciprocity might be "I've prepared a cost analysis to save you time"; Scarcity might be "Early bird pricing ends Friday." See Week 4 slides 13-14.

  - id: "W4-Q9-cialdini-social-proof-definition"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence"

    question: |
      What does Social Proof mean as a persuasion principle, and how is it applied in business writing?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "People follow others' actions; in memos, cite competitors or similar organizations that adopted your idea"
        feedback: "Correct! Social Proof works by showing that others have already made the choice you're recommending."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "People verify information through social media; in memos, include social media metrics"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Social Proof isn't about social media; it's about showing others' behavior."

      - key: "C"
        text: "People like things that benefit society; in memos, emphasize social benefits"
        feedback: "Incorrect. That relates to values alignment, not Social Proof as Cialdini defines it."

      - key: "D"
        text: "People trust numbers; in memos, include more statistics"
        feedback: "Incorrect. That's related to Authority or Logos, not Social Proof. Social Proof is about showing others' choices."

    general_feedback: |
      **Social Proof** is the principle that people tend to do what they see others doing. In business writing, you invoke Social Proof by saying things like "Three competing firms adopted this approach" or "15 Fortune 500 companies use this solution." This triggers **consensus** (agreement among a group), making readers think "If others like me chose it, it must be good." See Week 4 slides 13-14.

    topic: "The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing"

    question: |
      Which of the following is NOT one of the 8 S's of strong business writing according to Bill Birchard?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Syntax (grammatical structure)"
        feedback: "Correct! The 8 S's do not include Syntax. The eight are: Simplicity, Specificity, Surprise, Stirring Language, Seductiveness, Smart Thinking, Social Content, Storytelling."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Simplicity"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Simplicity (short sentences, familiar words) is one of the 8 S's."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Specificity"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Specificity (concrete words) is one of the 8 S's."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Stirring Language"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Stirring Language (emotional connotations) is one of the 8 S's."

    general_feedback: |
      Bill Birchard's 8 S's are: Simplicity, Specificity, Surprise, Stirring Language, Seductiveness, Smart Thinking, Social Content, and Storytelling. These eight features activate the brain's reward **circuits** (neural pathways) and make writing more engaging. **Syntax** (grammatical structure) is important for writing quality but is not one of Birchard's specific principles. See Week 4 slide 19.

    topic: "The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing"

    question: |
      How do Simplicity and Specificity work together in strong business writing?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Simplicity uses short sentences and familiar words; Specificity replaces vague language with concrete details and numbers"
        feedback: "Correct! Simplicity reduces cognitive load; Specificity prevents ambiguity by using precise language."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Simplicity is for emails; Specificity is for reports"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both apply to all business documents regardless of format."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Simplicity means shorter documents; Specificity means longer documents"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These principles affect word choice and sentence structure, not document length."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Simplicity focuses on grammar; Specificity focuses on vocabulary"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Simplicity is about clarity and word familiarity; Specificity is about concrete language."

    general_feedback: |
      Simplicity and Specificity are complementary. Simplicity reduces **cognitive load** (the mental effort required to understand) by using short sentences and common words—making reading effortless. Specificity prevents vagueness by using concrete language and numbers instead of abstract adjectives. Together: "The new system will improve efficiency by 40%" (simple + specific) beats "The new system will improve operational efficiency going forward" (complex + vague). See Week 4 slides 19-20.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing"

    question: |
      What is the purpose of Stirring Language as one of the 8 S's, and why does it matter in business writing?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Stirring Language uses emotional connotations to engage readers; these emotions are processed in 200 milliseconds—faster than rational meaning"
        feedback: "Correct! Emotional impact is immediate and influences persuasion before conscious reasoning takes over."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Stirring Language means longer, more impressive vocabulary"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Stirring Language is about emotional impact, not complexity or vocabulary size."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Stirring Language includes metaphors and poetic language"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While metaphors can be stirring, the principle is about emotional connotations in word choice."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Stirring Language motivates readers to take action through urgency"
        feedback: "Incorrect. That's closer to Scarcity or Seductiveness. Stirring Language works through emotional resonance."

    general_feedback: |
      **Stirring Language** uses words with strong emotional connotations to activate the brain's reward circuit. Because emotional meaning is processed in 200 milliseconds—faster than logical meaning—it influences persuasion immediately. This **automatic processing** (happening without conscious thought) makes stirring language particularly powerful. Example: "Cut unnecessary expenses by 15%" (Stirring) beats "Reduce operational costs by 15%" (neutral). Both communicate the same information, but different emotional responses result. See Week 4 slides 19, 23.
