<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Segment 1: The Architecture of Persuasion">

## Segment 1: The Architecture of Persuasion

**Focus:** How to structure arguments so busy readers say "yes"

**Frameworks:**
- The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, McKinsey)
- SCQA Framework (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="content" title="The Problem with Most Business Writing">

## How Most People Write Memos

1. Background context (3 paragraphs)
2. History of the problem (2 paragraphs)
3. Analysis details (5 paragraphs)
4. **Recommendation** (buried in final paragraph)

**Result:** Executive skims first page, loses interest, never reads recommendation.

**Better way:** Start with the answer.

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="The Pyramid Principle">

## The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, 1987)

**Core Principle:** Start with the answer.

**Structure:**
```
         [MAIN RECOMMENDATION]
                 |
    ____________________________
    |            |             |
[Reason 1]  [Reason 2]   [Reason 3]
    |            |             |
[Evidence]  [Evidence]   [Evidence]
```

**Application:** Executive summaries, board memos, consulting reports, your Business Memo.

**Source:** Minto, B. (2021). *The Pyramid Principle* (3rd ed.). Pearson. [Standard at McKinsey, BCG, Bain]

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="content" title="Pyramid Principle: Key Components">

## Key Components of the Pyramid

**Apex (Top):**
- Main conclusion or recommendation
- Answers the reader's primary question
- Specific and actionable

**Supporting Layer (Middle):**
- 3-5 key reasons supporting your conclusion
- Must be MECE: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
- Each reason answers "Why should I believe/accept this?"

**Evidence Layer (Bottom):**
- Data, examples, research supporting each reason
- Specific facts, statistics, case studies
- Credible sources and concrete details

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="Pyramid Example: Budget Request">

## Example: Budget Request Memo

**Apex (Main Recommendation):**
"Approve $10,000 for cloud CRM system by Q2."

**Supporting Reasons:**
1. **Efficiency:** Reduces admin time by 20% (saves $15K annually)
2. **Sales Performance:** Improves lead tracking, prevents lost opportunities
3. **Scalability:** Supports planned team growth from 5 to 15 people

**Evidence for Each Reason:**
- Reason 1: Time study data, current process analysis, ROI calculation
- Reason 2: Lost deal reports, competitor comparison, sales projections
- Reason 3: Vendor capacity specs, growth plan timeline, integration capabilities

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="SCQA Framework">

## SCQA: Crafting Compelling Openings

**Four-part introduction structure that engages readers immediately.**

**S = Situation** — Context the reader already knows (undisputed facts)

**C = Complication** — What has changed; why action is needed now

**Q = Question** — The explicit issue to address

**A = Answer** — Your solution/recommendation (this is your Pyramid apex)

**Source:** Derived from Minto's Pyramid Principle; widely used in consulting communications.

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="SCQA: Each Component Explained">

## Breaking Down SCQA

**Situation (1-2 sentences):**
- Establish common ground
- State facts reader already knows
- Build agreement before introducing problem

**Complication (1-2 sentences):**
- Introduce what changed or went wrong
- Create tension or urgency
- Show why status quo won't work

**Question (1 sentence):**
- Make explicit the question reader is now thinking
- Frame the problem to be solved
- Sets up your answer

**Answer (1-2 sentences):**
- Your recommendation or solution
- Direct and specific
- Becomes the apex of your Pyramid

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="SCQA Example: Real Business Memo">

## Case Study: New Hire Request

**To:** Department Head
**From:** Team Lead
**Subject:** Request for Two Additional Analysts

**Opening Paragraph (SCQA):**

**[S]** Our analytics team currently consists of three analysts supporting five product lines across Southeast Asia. **[C]** However, two new markets (Thailand and Indonesia) launched last quarter, and response times for client requests have doubled from 48 hours to 96 hours. **[Q]** How do we maintain service quality while supporting regional expansion? **[A]** I recommend hiring two junior analysts by Q2 to prevent client dissatisfaction and retain current team members who are at risk of burnout.

**Supporting Pyramid:**
- **Reason 1:** Workload data shows 180% capacity
- **Reason 2:** Two clients complained about delays
- **Reason 3:** ROI analysis shows hires pay for themselves in 8 months

**Result:** Approved within one week.

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="SCQA Common Mistakes">

## What NOT to Do with SCQA

**Mistake 1: Starting with Complication**
❌ "We have a problem with response times..."
✓ First establish Situation, then introduce Complication

**Mistake 2: Vague Complication**
❌ "Things have gotten more challenging..."
✓ Be specific: "Response times doubled from 48 to 96 hours"

**Mistake 3: Implicit Question**
❌ Skip the Question entirely
✓ Make it explicit: "How do we maintain quality while scaling?"

**Mistake 4: Weak Answer**
❌ "We should explore options for expanding the team..."
✓ Be direct: "I recommend hiring two junior analysts by Q2."

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Segment 1 Takeaway">

## Structure: Start with the Answer

**The Pyramid Principle:** Main recommendation first, then supporting reasons, then evidence.

**SCQA Framework:** Situation → Complication → Question → Answer.

**Your Memo:** Use SCQA to open, Pyramid to organize.

**Next:** Why people say "yes"—Cialdini's Six Principles.

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2: The Science of Influence">

## Segment 2: The Science of Influence

**Focus:** Evidence-based persuasion techniques from 35+ years of research

**Framework:** Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence

**Application:** Ethical persuasion in business writing

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="quote" title="Robert Cialdini Quote">

> "A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason."

— Robert Cialdini, *Influence: Science and Practice* (2009)

**Key Insight:** Even weak reasons increase compliance. "Because" is a persuasive word.

</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Robert Cialdini: Credentials">

## Why Trust Cialdini?

**Academic Credentials:**
- PhD in Social Psychology, University of North Carolina
- Elected to American Academy of Arts & Sciences (2018)

**Citations:** 2,308+ across all editions of *Influence*

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="framework" title="The Six Principles of Influence">

## Cialdini's Six Principles

1. **Reciprocity** — People feel obligated to return favors
2. **Commitment & Consistency** — People align with past statements
3. **Social Proof** — People follow others' actions
4. **Authority** — People defer to credible experts
5. **Liking** — People are persuaded by those they like
6. **Scarcity** — Limited availability increases value

**Source:** Cialdini, R. B. (2009). *Influence: Science and Practice* (5th ed.). Pearson.

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Principle 1: Reciprocity">

## Principle 1: Reciprocity

**Definition:** People feel obligated to return favors and concessions.

**How It Works:**
- Give something of value first, before making your request
- The "gift" triggers psychological obligation
- Works even with small, unsolicited favors

**In Business Writing:**
- Offer valuable insights before requesting a meeting
- Provide helpful analysis before asking for resources
- Share credit generously in collaborative proposals
- Include useful resources or templates in requests

**Example:**
"I've prepared a preliminary analysis of the Q2 sales data (attached) that shows three opportunities for cost reduction. Could we meet next week to discuss implementation?"

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="Principle 2: Commitment and Consistency">

## Principle 2: Commitment and Consistency

**Definition:** People want to be consistent with what they've previously said or done.

**How It Works:**
- Public commitments are particularly powerful
- People align new actions with past decisions
- Small initial commitments lead to larger ones

**In Business Writing:**
- Reference past agreements: "As we agreed in Q1..."
- Cite reader's previous statements or decisions
- Build on established goals or values
- Get small "yes" before big "yes"

**Example:**
"In our January meeting, you emphasized the importance of customer retention. This CRM investment directly supports that priority by reducing response time from 48 to 24 hours."

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="content" title="Principle 3: Social Proof">

## Principle 3: Social Proof

**Definition:** People look to others' behavior to guide their own decisions, especially under uncertainty.

**How It Works:**
- "Everyone else is doing it" reduces perceived risk
- Most powerful when similar others have succeeded
- Testimonials, case studies, adoption rates all work

**In Business Writing:**
- Cite competitor actions or industry trends
- Reference colleagues who've adopted your approach
- Include testimonials or success stories
- Use specific numbers: "15 Fortune 500 companies..."

**Example:**
"Three direct competitors launched similar mobile apps in Q4, gaining an average of 50,000 new customers each. Our market research shows we're losing 12% market share to these digital channels."

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="content" title="Principle 4: Authority">

## Principle 4: Authority

**Definition:** People defer to credible experts and authoritative sources.

**How It Works:**
- Credentials, titles, and expertise trigger automatic compliance
- Research citations add credibility
- Professional presentation enhances perceived authority

**In Business Writing:**
- Cite credible research: "According to Gartner..."
- Establish your expertise early
- Reference expert endorsements
- Use professional formatting and error-free prose

**Example:**
"Gartner's 2024 CIO Survey ranks this platform as the #1 enterprise solution for mid-sized companies, with 92% customer satisfaction. I consulted with our IT director, who confirmed compatibility with our current infrastructure."

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Principle 5: Liking">

## Principle 5: Liking

**Definition:** People are more persuaded by those they like.

**How It Works:**
- Similarity increases liking: "We're alike"
- Compliments increase liking: "I value you"
- Cooperation increases liking: "We're on the same team"

**In Business Writing:**
- Find common ground: "As a fellow NEU alumnus..."
- Acknowledge shared challenges: "I know Q2 has been demanding..."
- Maintain positive, respectful tone throughout
- Show appreciation: "Thank you for your insights on..."

**Example:**
"I know you've been focused on cost efficiency this quarter—I share that priority. The solution I'm proposing actually reduces costs while improving service quality, addressing both our goals."

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Principle 6: Scarcity">

## Principle 6: Scarcity

**Definition:** Limited availability increases perceived value.

**How It Works:**
- Deadlines create urgency
- Exclusive opportunities feel more valuable
- Fear of losing out motivates action

**In Business Writing:**
- Emphasize time-limited opportunities
- Note exclusive access or unique capabilities
- Highlight what's at risk if action delayed
- Use specific deadlines, not vague timeframes

**Example:**
"The vendor is offering a 20% discount for contracts signed before March 31st, saving us $4,000. Additionally, implementation takes 60 days, so signing by month-end ensures we're operational before Q2 peak season."

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="content" title="The 7th Principle: Unity">

## Bonus: Principle 7 — Unity

**Added in *Pre-Suasion* (2016)**

**Definition:** We say "yes" to people we consider part of our group.

**How It Works:**
- Shared identity creates trust and cooperation
- "We" language signals group membership
- Common goals unite disparate stakeholders

**In Business Writing:**
- Use "we" instead of "I" or "you"
- Emphasize common goals: "Our shared objective is..."
- Reference team identity: "As members of the product team..."
- Frame as collaboration: "Together we can..."

**Example:**
"As members of the sales organization, we all benefit when customer retention improves. This initiative helps all of us hit our Q2 targets by reducing churn from 15% to 10%."

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Applying Multiple Principles">

## Using Multiple Principles Together

**Scenario:** Requesting manager approval for $500 conference attendance.

**❌ Weak Memo (No Principles):**
"I'd like to attend the Digital Marketing Summit. It looks interesting and I think it would be beneficial."

**✅ Strong Memo (Multiple Principles):**
"I'd like to attend the Digital Marketing Summit on May 15th. Here's why this benefits our team:

- **[Social Proof]** Three competitors will be presenting case studies on Southeast Asian markets—insights we can apply immediately.
- **[Authority]** Keynote speaker is HubSpot's APAC Director, whose framework we've already started using.
- **[Reciprocity]** I'll share key takeaways with the team in a 30-minute workshop the following week.
- **[Scarcity]** Early bird registration ends April 10th ($200 savings).

**Request:** Approve $500 registration by April 8th."

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="content" title="Case Study: $2M Budget Approval">

## Real Example: Software Investment Proposal

**Context:** Mid-level manager proposing $2M enterprise software investment to CFO.

**Key Persuasion Elements:**

**SCQA Structure:**
- **S:** Current system handles 100 users
- **C:** Company grew to 500 users, system crashes weekly
- **Q:** How do we prevent productivity loss and data risk?
- **A:** Invest $2M in scalable cloud solution

**Cialdini Principles:**
- **Authority:** "Gartner ranks this as #1 enterprise solution"
- **Social Proof:** "15 Fortune 500 companies migrated last year"
- **Scarcity:** "Vendor offering 20% discount through Q2 only"
- **Reciprocity:** "I've prepared a 90-day migration plan to minimize disruption"

**Pyramid Structure:** Three supporting reasons—productivity, security, scalability.

**Outcome:** CFO approved full budget within two weeks.

</slide>

<slide number="29" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2 Takeaway">

## Persuasion: Apply the Six Principles

**Reciprocity** — Give value first

**Commitment & Consistency** — Reference past agreements

**Social Proof** — Show others agree

**Authority** — Cite credible sources

**Liking** — Build connection

**Scarcity** — Emphasize urgency

**Unity** — Use "we" language

**Next:** Style and revision strategies.

</slide>

<slide number="30" layout="section-break" title="Segment 3: Writing with Impact">

## Segment 3: Writing with Impact

**Focus:** Neuroscience-backed style techniques and revision frameworks

**Frameworks:**
- The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing (Birchard, HBR 2021)
- "What? So What? Now What?" Revision Method (Abrahams, Stanford GSB)

**Goal:** Turn good drafts into compelling final products.

</slide>

<slide number="31" layout="framework" title="The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing">

## Bill Birchard's 8 S's (HBR, 2021)

**Eight features that activate the brain's reward circuit:**

1. **Simplicity** — Short sentences, familiar words
2. **Specificity** — Concrete words beat abstract ("pelican" beats "bird")
3. **Surprise** — Unexpected content creates engagement
4. **Stirring Language** — Emotional connotation (processed in 200 milliseconds)
5. **Seductiveness** — Build anticipation
6. **Smart Thinking** — Create "aha moments"
7. **Social Content** — Include human angles
8. **Storytelling** — Even 12-second narratives activate reward regions

**Source:** Birchard, B. (2021, July–August). The science of strong business writing. *Harvard Business Review*, 99(4).

</slide>

<slide number="32" layout="content" title="S1: Simplicity">

## S1: Simplicity

**Definition:** Short sentences and familiar words reduce cognitive load.

**Why It Works:**
- Processing fluency—easier to read equals more believable
- Readers can focus on content, not decoding language
- Executives appreciate brevity

**In Business Writing:**
- Target 15-20 words per sentence average
- Replace jargon with plain language
- Eliminate nominalizations: "implement" not "implementation of"
- Cut unnecessary qualifiers: "very," "quite," "rather"

**Before:** "The implementation of the aforementioned customer relationship management system will facilitate the optimization of operational efficiency."

**After:** "The new CRM will cut response time by 40%."

</slide>

<slide number="33" layout="content" title="S2: Specificity">

## S2: Specificity

**Definition:** Concrete words activate more brain regions than abstract ones.

**Why It Works:**
- Concrete words trigger sensory and motor cortex
- Numbers are more memorable than adjectives
- Specificity builds credibility

**In Business Writing:**
- Replace adjectives with numbers: "40% increase" not "significant improvement"
- Use concrete nouns: "MacBook" not "device"
- Include specific details: names, dates, amounts
- Avoid vague qualifiers: "many," "several," "soon," "recently"

**Before:** "We saw significant improvement in customer satisfaction recently."

**After:** "Customer satisfaction rose from 72% to 89% in Q1 2024."

</slide>

<slide number="34" layout="content" title="S3: Surprise & S4: Stirring Language">

## S3: Surprise

**Definition:** Unexpected content violates predictions and creates engagement.

**Application:**
- Lead with counterintuitive findings
- Subvert expectations in opening lines
- Include unexpected statistics or quotes

**Example:** "Our biggest competitor isn't who you think—it's customer inertia."

---

## S4: Stirring Language

**Definition:** Words with emotional connotation processed in 200 milliseconds—faster than meaning.

**Application:**
- Choose active, vivid verbs: "accelerate" not "improve"
- Frame positively: "unlock savings" not "reduce costs"
- Use power words: "transform," "breakthrough," "proven"

**Example:** "Let's accelerate growth" beats "Let's try to improve performance"

</slide>

<slide number="35" layout="content" title="8 S's in Action: Before & After">

## Transforming Flat Writing

**❌ BEFORE (Weak Style):**
"The implementation of the new customer relationship management system will facilitate improved operational efficiency and enhance our ability to serve clients in a more effective manner going forward."

**Problems:** Abstract nouns, vague adjectives, wordy (28 words), passive

---

**✅ AFTER (8 S's Applied):**
"The new CRM will cut response time by 40% and help us win back lost clients."

**Why Better:**
- **Simplicity:** 15 words vs. 28
- **Specificity:** "40%" vs. "improved efficiency"
- **Stirring Language:** "win back" vs. "serve more effectively"
- **Social Content:** "clients" as humans, not abstract "operational efficiency"

</slide>

<slide number="36" layout="framework" title="What? So What? Now What?">

## Matt Abrahams — Stanford GSB Strategic Communication

**Revision Framework for Any Business Communication:**

**WHAT?** — The information, idea, or belief you're conveying

**SO WHAT?** — The relevance for your audience; the value your idea brings

**NOW WHAT?** — What comes next; the specific action you want

---

**Before Writing:** Answer all three questions to clarify purpose.

**After Writing:** Check if your draft answers all three clearly.

**Source:** Abrahams, M. (2023). Class takeaways — Essentials of strategic communication. *Stanford Graduate School of Business Insights*.

</slide>

<slide number="37" layout="content" title="Case Study: Revision in Action">

## Before & After: Project Update Memo

**❌ DRAFT VERSION:**
"The integration project is progressing. We have completed several key milestones and are working on the remaining tasks. There have been some challenges, but the team is addressing them. We expect to finish soon."

**Problems:**
- Vague ("progressing," "several," "some," "soon")
- No WHAT/SO WHAT/NOW WHAT
- Passive voice
- No Cialdini principles
- Violates Simplicity and Specificity

---

**✅ REVISED VERSION:**
"**[WHAT]** The integration is 80% complete—8 of 10 modules deployed successfully.

**[SO WHAT]** We're on track to launch by Q2, enabling $2M in projected cost savings for the finance team.

**[COMPLICATION]** Module 9 requires an additional $5K for third-party API access.

**[NOW WHAT]** Please approve the $5K expense by Friday so we stay on schedule and hit our Q2 launch target."

</slide>

<slide number="38" layout="content" title="Tone: Word Choice Matters">

## The Power of Stirring Language

**Scenario:** Proposing cost-cutting initiative

---

**❌ Weak Tone (Abstract, Passive):**
"Cost reduction measures should be implemented to improve financial performance."

**Problems:** Passive voice, abstract, no emotional engagement

---

**✅ Strong Tone (Active, Specific, Stirring):**
"Let's cut unnecessary expenses by 15% this quarter—freeing up budget to hire two analysts and accelerate growth."

**Why Better:**
- Active voice: "Let's cut" vs. "should be implemented"
- Specific number: 15%
- Positive reframe: "freeing up budget" vs. "cost reduction"
- Human benefit: "hire two analysts"
- Stirring word: "accelerate" vs. "improve"

</slide>

<slide number="39" layout="content" title="Revision Checklist">

## Your Memo Revision Protocol

**Step 1: Structure Check**
- ✓ Does it open with SCQA?
- ✓ Is the main recommendation in the first paragraph?
- ✓ Are supporting reasons organized in Pyramid structure?

**Step 2: Persuasion Check**
- ✓ Have I used 2+ Cialdini principles explicitly?
- ✓ Is there a clear "because" for my request?
- ✓ Does it answer "What? So What? Now What?"

**Step 3: Style Check**
- ✓ Are numbers specific (not "many," "soon," "improved")?
- ✓ Is it written in active voice?
- ✓ Have I cut unnecessary words (aim for -20% from draft)?
- ✓ Does it include "you" or "we" language (social content)?

**Step 4: Proofread**
- ✓ Read aloud—does it sound natural?
- ✓ Grammarly check for errors
- ✓ Peer review (tutorial workshop!)

</slide>

<slide number="40" layout="content" title="Integration Example: Complete Memo">

## Putting It All Together

**To:** Department Head
**From:** Marketing Coordinator
**Subject:** Request for $3K Social Media Advertising Budget

---

**[SCQA + Pyramid Opening]:**

**[S]** Our Instagram following grew from 5,000 to 12,000 in six months using organic content alone. **[C]** However, engagement has plateaued at 2% for the past two months—below our 5% target needed to drive sales conversions. **[Q]** How can we reignite growth and hit our sales targets? **[A]** I recommend allocating $3,000 for targeted social media ads in Q2.

**[Pyramid Structure - Three Reasons]:**

1. **ROI Proven [Authority]:** Industry benchmarks show a 400% ROI on social ads in our sector (source: Hootsuite 2024 Report).
2. **Competitors Active [Social Proof]:** Three direct competitors launched paid campaigns last quarter and gained 20K+ followers each.
3. **Timing Critical [Scarcity]:** Q2 coincides with peak buying season—missing this window means waiting until Q4.

**[Reciprocity]:** I've drafted a 60-day campaign plan with A/B testing protocols to maximize budget efficiency (attached).

**[Now What]:** Please approve this $3K expense by March 15th so we can launch by April 1st and capture Q2 momentum.
