# Persuasive Written Communication

<speaker-notes>
Welcome students to Week 4. Today we explore the art and science of persuasive written communication—essential for business success.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="Hook: Written Word Drives Decisions">

# 65%

**of business decisions are influenced by written communication**

Not just the idea—the way it's written.

*(McKinsey Global Survey, 2023)*

<speaker-notes>
Key moment—this statistic often surprises students. McKinsey research shows that most major business decisions depend on persuasive documents: memos, proposals, business cases. Even brilliant ideas fail if poorly communicated in writing. Your Business Memo assignment due this week puts this into practice. Common student question: "Does this include emails?" Yes—emails, memos, proposals, reports all count. The frameworks we learn today will serve you for years—consulting firms teach these to new hires.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Today's Learning Objectives">

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the Pyramid Principle and SCQA framework to structure persuasive memos
2. **Integrate** Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence into business writing
3. **Evaluate** tone and style choices using the 8 S's framework
4. **Revise** written drafts using the "What? So What? Now What?" method

<speaker-notes>
Four specific, actionable frameworks today—you'll use all four in your memo. Objective 1 covers structure—how to organize arguments (Minto's Pyramid, SCQA). Objective 2 covers persuasion psychology—why people say yes (Cialdini). Objective 3 covers style—making writing clear and compelling (Birchard's 8 S's). Objective 4 covers revision—turning good drafts into great final products (Abrahams). These aren't abstract theories—Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and consulting firms teach these. Barbara Minto developed the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey in the 1960s—still the firm standard today.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="Assessment Connection">

## Your Business Memo is Due This Week (10%)

**Timeline:**
- **Today (Lecture):** Learn persuasive writing frameworks
- **Tutorial:** Peer review workshop—bring your draft
- **By End of Week:** Submit final memo via Moodle (11:59 PM deadline)

**What's Next:**
- **Week 5-7:** Prepare Persuasive Proposal (15%)—builds on today's frameworks
- The structure you learn today applies to both assignments

**Tutorial Attendance:** Peer feedback significantly improves final grades (avg +8%)

<speaker-notes>
This is an assessment week—your memo is due at week's end. Tutorial is essential; peer review catches errors you'll miss on your own. Business Memo worth 10%—first major portfolio piece. Persuasive Proposal coming in 3 weeks (15%)—uses same frameworks. Tutorial requires bringing draft—even rough version is fine. Past data: students who attend peer review score average 8% higher than those who skip. Vietnamese context: Feedback culture may feel direct, but it's how professionals improve.

<slide number="5" layout="section-break" title="Today's Roadmap">

## Today's Journey

**Segment 1:** Structure — The Pyramid Principle & SCQA (25 min)

**Segment 2:** Persuasion Psychology — Cialdini's Six Principles (30 min)

**Segment 3:** Style & Revision — The 8 S's and "What? So What? Now What?" (25 min)

<speaker-notes>
Today is organized into three focused segments. First, we cover structure—how to organize persuasive arguments using Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle and SCQA framework. Second, we explore persuasion psychology using Robert Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence. Third, we examine style and revision using Bill Birchard's 8 S's and Matt Abrahams' strategic communication framework. Each segment includes real business examples and direct application to your Business Memo.

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Segment 1: The Architecture of Persuasion">

## Segment 1: The Architecture of Persuasion

**Focus:** How to structure arguments so busy readers say "yes"

**Frameworks:**
- The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, McKinsey)
- SCQA Framework (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)

<speaker-notes>
Segment 1 focuses on structure—the foundation of all persuasive writing. Without proper structure, even brilliant ideas get ignored. We'll cover two frameworks: The Pyramid Principle from Barbara Minto at McKinsey, and the SCQA framework for crafting compelling openings. Both are industry standards used by top consulting firms worldwide. The Pyramid Principle tells you how to organize your entire document—main recommendation first, supporting reasons second, evidence third. SCQA tells you how to open your document—create engagement before presenting your recommendation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="content" title="The Problem with Most Business Writing">

## How Most People Write Memos

1. Background context (3 paragraphs)
2. History of the problem (2 paragraphs)
3. Analysis details (5 paragraphs)
4. **Recommendation** (buried in final paragraph)

**Result:** Executive skims first page, loses interest, never reads recommendation.

**Better way:** Start with the answer.

<speaker-notes>
Most business writing is structured like a mystery novel—answer revealed at the end. Works for fiction; fails for executives with 200 emails per day. Traditional academic writing builds up to conclusion with thesis at end. Business writing flips this: conclusion first, supporting details follow. Executives often read only the first paragraph—make it count. Vietnamese context: some students taught to "build suspense" in writing. In business, suspense equals ignored memos.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="The Pyramid Principle">

## The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, 1987)

**Core Principle:** Start with the answer.

**Structure:**
```
         [MAIN RECOMMENDATION]
                 |
    ____________________________
    |            |             |
[Reason 1]  [Reason 2]   [Reason 3]
    |            |             |
[Evidence]  [Evidence]   [Evidence]
```

**Application:** Executive summaries, board memos, consulting reports, your Business Memo.

**Source:** Minto, B. (2021). *The Pyramid Principle* (3rd ed.). Pearson. [Standard at McKinsey, BCG, Bain]

<speaker-notes>
Barbara Minto was first female consultant hired at McKinsey (1963). She developed this to help consultants communicate clearly to clients. Now the global standard for business writing. Pyramid structure: Top equals what you want reader to know or do. Middle equals why—three to five reasons. Bottom equals supporting evidence. Why it works: Reader gets decision immediately, can drill into details if needed. MECE principle: Reasons must be Mutually Exclusive (no overlap), Collectively Exhaustive (nothing missing).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="content" title="Pyramid Principle: Key Components">

## Key Components of the Pyramid

**Apex (Top):**
- Main conclusion or recommendation
- Answers the reader's primary question
- Specific and actionable

**Supporting Layer (Middle):**
- 3-5 key reasons supporting your conclusion
- Must be MECE: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
- Each reason answers "Why should I believe/accept this?"

**Evidence Layer (Bottom):**
- Data, examples, research supporting each reason
- Specific facts, statistics, case studies
- Credible sources and concrete details

<speaker-notes>
Let's break down each layer. Apex: This is your headline message—what you want the reader to do or know. Make it specific: "Approve $10,000 for new CRM system" not "We should consider technology improvements." Supporting Layer: These are your arguments. MECE is critical—reasons shouldn't overlap (exclusive) and together they should cover everything important (exhaustive). If you have 7 reasons, some probably overlap—combine them. Evidence Layer: This is where you prove each reason. Use numbers, not adjectives: "30% increase" not "significant improvement."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="Pyramid Example: Budget Request">

## Example: Budget Request Memo

**Apex (Main Recommendation):**
"Approve $10,000 for cloud CRM system by Q2."

**Supporting Reasons:**
1. **Efficiency:** Reduces admin time by 20% (saves $15K annually)
2. **Sales Performance:** Improves lead tracking, prevents lost opportunities
3. **Scalability:** Supports planned team growth from 5 to 15 people

**Evidence for Each Reason:**
- Reason 1: Time study data, current process analysis, ROI calculation
- Reason 2: Lost deal reports, competitor comparison, sales projections
- Reason 3: Vendor capacity specs, growth plan timeline, integration capabilities

<speaker-notes>
This is a real budget request structure (anonymized). Notice how the recommendation is clear and specific at the top—not "We should explore CRM options." The three reasons are MECE: efficiency (cost), performance (revenue), scalability (future). Each addresses a different executive concern. Evidence layer makes each reason credible—not just assertions but data. Vietnamese context: Some cultures prefer building up to request. In Western business, direct approach performs better. Think about your memo draft—what's your main recommendation? That should be sentence one.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="SCQA Framework">

## SCQA: Crafting Compelling Openings

**Four-part introduction structure that engages readers immediately.**

**S = Situation** — Context the reader already knows (undisputed facts)

**C = Complication** — What has changed; why action is needed now

**Q = Question** — The explicit issue to address

**A = Answer** — Your solution/recommendation (this is your Pyramid apex)

**Source:** Derived from Minto's Pyramid Principle; widely used in consulting communications.

<speaker-notes>
SCQA is the "on-ramp" to your Pyramid structure. Creates engagement before you present recommendation. Avoids starting with boring context or obvious background. Situation: Start with agreement—facts no one disputes. Complication: Introduce tension, problem, or opportunity. Question: Make the reader's question explicit. Answer: Your recommendation, then support with Pyramid structure. This creates a narrative flow—reader wants to keep reading.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="SCQA: Each Component Explained">

## Breaking Down SCQA

**Situation (1-2 sentences):**
- Establish common ground
- State facts reader already knows
- Build agreement before introducing problem

**Complication (1-2 sentences):**
- Introduce what changed or went wrong
- Create tension or urgency
- Show why status quo won't work

**Question (1 sentence):**
- Make explicit the question reader is now thinking
- Frame the problem to be solved
- Sets up your answer

**Answer (1-2 sentences):**
- Your recommendation or solution
- Direct and specific
- Becomes the apex of your Pyramid

<speaker-notes>
Each component plays a specific role. Situation: Don't waste time explaining what everyone knows, but do establish shared context. Bad: "Since our company was founded in 1995..." Good: "Our sales team has grown from 5 to 15 people in two years." Complication: This is where you create engagement. Something changed, something's not working, there's an opportunity. This is what makes your memo relevant right now. Question: Often implicit in bad memos. Make it explicit. This is what the reader is wondering after reading the Complication. Answer: Your Pyramid apex. Clear, specific, actionable.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="SCQA Example: Real Business Memo">

## Case Study: New Hire Request

**To:** Department Head
**From:** Team Lead
**Subject:** Request for Two Additional Analysts

**Opening Paragraph (SCQA):**

**[S]** Our analytics team currently consists of three analysts supporting five product lines across Southeast Asia. **[C]** However, two new markets (Thailand and Indonesia) launched last quarter, and response times for client requests have doubled from 48 hours to 96 hours. **[Q]** How do we maintain service quality while supporting regional expansion? **[A]** I recommend hiring two junior analysts by Q2 to prevent client dissatisfaction and retain current team members who are at risk of burnout.

**Supporting Pyramid:**
- **Reason 1:** Workload data shows 180% capacity
- **Reason 2:** Two clients complained about delays
- **Reason 3:** ROI analysis shows hires pay for themselves in 8 months

**Result:** Approved within one week.

<speaker-notes>
This is a real memo format from a regional tech company (anonymized). Notice how SCQA creates urgency without being alarmist. Situation establishes current state—3 analysts, 5 product lines. Complication introduces problem—new markets, doubled response time. Question frames what reader is already wondering. Answer states recommendation clearly. After SCQA, memo continues with Pyramid structure supporting the three reasons. Total memo length: 1 page—executives love brevity. Vietnamese context: Some cultures prefer indirect requests ("Perhaps we might consider..."). In Western business writing, direct requests perform better.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="SCQA Common Mistakes">

## What NOT to Do with SCQA

**Mistake 1: Starting with Complication**
❌ "We have a problem with response times..."
✓ First establish Situation, then introduce Complication

**Mistake 2: Vague Complication**
❌ "Things have gotten more challenging..."
✓ Be specific: "Response times doubled from 48 to 96 hours"

**Mistake 3: Implicit Question**
❌ Skip the Question entirely
✓ Make it explicit: "How do we maintain quality while scaling?"

**Mistake 4: Weak Answer**
❌ "We should explore options for expanding the team..."
✓ Be direct: "I recommend hiring two junior analysts by Q2."

<speaker-notes>
These are the most common SCQA mistakes I see in student work. Mistake 1: Jumping straight to the problem without context confuses readers. They need the Situation first. Mistake 2: Vague language like "challenging," "difficult," "concerning" doesn't create urgency. Use specific facts and numbers. Mistake 3: Many writers skip the Question because it feels obvious to them. But making it explicit focuses the reader's attention and sets up your Answer perfectly. Mistake 4: Tentative language ("should explore," "might consider") undermines your credibility. Be confident and specific in your Answer. Read your memo draft—can you identify each SCQA component?
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Segment 1 Takeaway">

## Structure: Start with the Answer

**The Pyramid Principle:** Main recommendation first, then supporting reasons, then evidence.

**SCQA Framework:** Situation → Complication → Question → Answer.

**Your Memo:** Use SCQA to open, Pyramid to organize.

**Next:** Why people say "yes"—Cialdini's Six Principles.

<speaker-notes>
Let's consolidate Segment 1. Structure is the foundation of persuasive writing. The Pyramid Principle organizes your entire argument—start with your recommendation at the apex, support with three to five key reasons, back each reason with evidence. SCQA framework crafts your opening paragraph—establish common ground with Situation, introduce tension with Complication, make the reader's question explicit, then answer with your recommendation. These two frameworks work together: SCQA engages the reader, Pyramid delivers your case. For your Business Memo: write your SCQA opening first to clarify your argument, then build out your Pyramid structure with supporting reasons.

<slide number="16" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2: The Science of Influence">

## Segment 2: The Science of Influence

**Focus:** Evidence-based persuasion techniques from 35+ years of research

**Framework:** Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence

**Application:** Ethical persuasion in business writing

<speaker-notes>
Segment 2 introduces persuasion psychology based on Robert Cialdini's landmark research. Cialdini is a social psychologist who spent 35 years studying compliance—what makes people say yes to requests. His book *Influence* is on Warren Buffett's recommended reading list and appears in Fortune's "75 Smartest Business Books." These are not manipulation tricks—they're ethical persuasion techniques based on universal human psychology. You already use these unconsciously; today makes them conscious tools.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="quote" title="Robert Cialdini Quote">

> "A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason."

— Robert Cialdini, *Influence: Science and Practice* (2009)

**Key Insight:** Even weak reasons increase compliance. "Because" is a persuasive word.

<speaker-notes>
Cialdini spent 35 years researching what makes people say yes. His work is empirical—based on experiments, not opinions. The "because" study: "Can I cut in line?" versus "Can I cut in line because I'm in a rush?" Compliance doubled. Even trivial reasons work—humans respond to the word "because" as a persuasion trigger. Email subject line test: "Meeting request" versus "Meeting request—need your expertise on Q2 strategy." Second version gets 40% more responses because it includes a reason.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Robert Cialdini: Credentials">

## Why Trust Cialdini?

**Academic Credentials:**
- PhD in Social Psychology, University of North Carolina
- Elected to American Academy of Arts & Sciences (2018)
- Elected to National Academy of Sciences (2019)
- Professor Emeritus, Arizona State University

**Business Impact:**
- Consulting clients: Google, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco
- Taught at Stanford, Harvard Kennedy School
- Book on Warren Buffett's recommended reading list
- Fortune Magazine: "75 Smartest Business Books"

**Citations:** 2,308+ across all editions of *Influence*

<speaker-notes>
Cialdini is one of the most credible researchers in persuasion science. His academic credentials are impeccable—elected to both major US science academies. His work bridges academic rigor with business application—that's rare. Major tech companies hire him to train their teams. The 2,308 citations represent scholarly impact—his work is foundational. Vietnamese context: These are universal psychological principles, not culturally specific. The six principles apply across cultures, though specific applications may vary.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="framework" title="The Six Principles of Influence">

## Cialdini's Six Principles

1. **Reciprocity** — People feel obligated to return favors
2. **Commitment & Consistency** — People align with past statements
3. **Social Proof** — People follow others' actions
4. **Authority** — People defer to credible experts
5. **Liking** — People are persuaded by those they like
6. **Scarcity** — Limited availability increases value

**Source:** Cialdini, R. B. (2009). *Influence: Science and Practice* (5th ed.). Pearson.

<speaker-notes>
These are not manipulation tricks—they're ethical persuasion techniques based on human psychology. You already use these unconsciously; today makes them conscious tools. Reciprocity: Give before you ask—offer insights, then request meeting. Commitment: Reference past agreements ("As we discussed in Q1..."). Social Proof: Show others have adopted your idea ("Three departments already using this"). Authority: Cite credible sources, establish your expertise early. Liking: Build rapport through shared interests, positive tone. Scarcity: Emphasize deadlines, unique opportunities, limited windows.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Principle 1: Reciprocity">

## Principle 1: Reciprocity

**Definition:** People feel obligated to return favors and concessions.

**How It Works:**
- Give something of value first, before making your request
- The "gift" triggers psychological obligation
- Works even with small, unsolicited favors

**In Business Writing:**
- Offer valuable insights before requesting a meeting
- Provide helpful analysis before asking for resources
- Share credit generously in collaborative proposals
- Include useful resources or templates in requests

**Example:**
"I've prepared a preliminary analysis of the Q2 sales data (attached) that shows three opportunities for cost reduction. Could we meet next week to discuss implementation?"

<speaker-notes>
Reciprocity is one of the most powerful principles. When someone gives you something, you feel obligated to return the favor—it's deeply ingrained in human psychology. In writing, this means providing value before making asks. Bad email: "Can we meet to discuss Q2 strategy?" Good email: "I've drafted three strategies for Q2 growth based on our last conversation (attached). Can we meet to discuss which approach you prefer?" The draft analysis is the gift; the meeting request becomes easier to say yes to. Vietnamese context: Gift-giving is culturally significant—reciprocity aligns well with Vietnamese business culture.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="content" title="Principle 2: Commitment and Consistency">

## Principle 2: Commitment and Consistency

**Definition:** People want to be consistent with what they've previously said or done.

**How It Works:**
- Public commitments are particularly powerful
- People align new actions with past decisions
- Small initial commitments lead to larger ones

**In Business Writing:**
- Reference past agreements: "As we agreed in Q1..."
- Cite reader's previous statements or decisions
- Build on established goals or values
- Get small "yes" before big "yes"

**Example:**
"In our January meeting, you emphasized the importance of customer retention. This CRM investment directly supports that priority by reducing response time from 48 to 24 hours."

<speaker-notes>
People have a strong desire to appear consistent—it's tied to self-image and social perception. Once someone takes a position, they're more likely to honor it in future decisions. In business writing, remind readers of their past commitments, stated goals, or public positions. This makes your request align with their existing commitments rather than conflict with them. Vietnamese context: "Saving face" relates to consistency—people want to be seen as reliable and consistent. Bad memo: "I need budget for training." Good memo: "You mentioned in our annual review that developing junior staff is a priority this year. This $5K training program directly supports that goal."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="content" title="Principle 3: Social Proof">

## Principle 3: Social Proof

**Definition:** People look to others' behavior to guide their own decisions, especially under uncertainty.

**How It Works:**
- "Everyone else is doing it" reduces perceived risk
- Most powerful when similar others have succeeded
- Testimonials, case studies, adoption rates all work

**In Business Writing:**
- Cite competitor actions or industry trends
- Reference colleagues who've adopted your approach
- Include testimonials or success stories
- Use specific numbers: "15 Fortune 500 companies..."

**Example:**
"Three direct competitors launched similar mobile apps in Q4, gaining an average of 50,000 new customers each. Our market research shows we're losing 12% market share to these digital channels."

<speaker-notes>
Social proof is especially powerful in business because executives constantly benchmark against competitors. When others are doing something, it reduces perceived risk and creates FOMO (fear of missing out). In Vietnamese business culture, social proof is particularly influential—group harmony and following successful examples are valued. Bad proposal: "We should build a mobile app." Good proposal: "Fifteen companies in our sector launched mobile apps last year, with 73% reporting ROI within 6 months. Our three largest competitors all have apps with 4+ star ratings." Numbers make social proof concrete—"many companies" is vague, "15 Fortune 500 companies" is credible.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="content" title="Principle 4: Authority">

## Principle 4: Authority

**Definition:** People defer to credible experts and authoritative sources.

**How It Works:**
- Credentials, titles, and expertise trigger automatic compliance
- Research citations add credibility
- Professional presentation enhances perceived authority

**In Business Writing:**
- Cite credible research: "According to Gartner..."
- Establish your expertise early
- Reference expert endorsements
- Use professional formatting and error-free prose

**Example:**
"Gartner's 2024 CIO Survey ranks this platform as the #1 enterprise solution for mid-sized companies, with 92% customer satisfaction. I consulted with our IT director, who confirmed compatibility with our current infrastructure."

<speaker-notes>
Authority is about credibility—readers are more persuaded when sources are credible. In business writing, this means citing authoritative research (Gartner, McKinsey, Harvard Business Review), establishing your expertise, and presenting professionally. Bad memo: "This software is good." Good memo: "This software is ranked #1 by Gartner (attached report) and recommended by our IT director." Two types of authority: borrowed (citing Gartner) and intrinsic (your own expertise). Build both. Vietnamese context: Titles and credentials matter significantly—always include relevant qualifications. Typos and formatting errors undermine authority—proofread carefully.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Principle 5: Liking">

## Principle 5: Liking

**Definition:** People are more persuaded by those they like.

**How It Works:**
- Similarity increases liking: "We're alike"
- Compliments increase liking: "I value you"
- Cooperation increases liking: "We're on the same team"

**In Business Writing:**
- Find common ground: "As a fellow NEU alumnus..."
- Acknowledge shared challenges: "I know Q2 has been demanding..."
- Maintain positive, respectful tone throughout
- Show appreciation: "Thank you for your insights on..."

**Example:**
"I know you've been focused on cost efficiency this quarter—I share that priority. The solution I'm proposing actually reduces costs while improving service quality, addressing both our goals."

<speaker-notes>
Liking is subtle but powerful. We're more persuaded by people we like, and we like people who are similar to us, who compliment us, and who cooperate with us. In business writing, this translates to finding common ground, showing respect, and framing requests as collaboration rather than demands. Bad memo tone: "I need you to approve this." Good memo tone: "I know we both want to improve customer satisfaction—here's an approach that I think aligns with your Q2 priorities." Vietnamese context: Building rapport before business is culturally valued—this principle aligns well. Show you understand the reader's perspective and challenges.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Principle 6: Scarcity">

## Principle 6: Scarcity

**Definition:** Limited availability increases perceived value.

**How It Works:**
- Deadlines create urgency
- Exclusive opportunities feel more valuable
- Fear of losing out motivates action

**In Business Writing:**
- Emphasize time-limited opportunities
- Note exclusive access or unique capabilities
- Highlight what's at risk if action delayed
- Use specific deadlines, not vague timeframes

**Example:**
"The vendor is offering a 20% discount for contracts signed before March 31st, saving us $4,000. Additionally, implementation takes 60 days, so signing by month-end ensures we're operational before Q2 peak season."

<speaker-notes>
Scarcity creates urgency—people value things more when they're limited or at risk of being lost. In business writing, this means emphasizing deadlines, limited windows, and what's at risk if we delay. Bad memo: "We should act on this soon." Good memo: "The 20% vendor discount expires March 31st ($4,000 savings), and our main competitor is evaluating the same solution—first mover advantage matters." Make scarcity specific: exact dates, specific savings, clear consequences. Vietnamese context: Face-saving relates to scarcity—"be first" or "don't fall behind competitors" can be motivating frames.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="content" title="The 7th Principle: Unity">

## Bonus: Principle 7 — Unity

**Added in *Pre-Suasion* (2016)**

**Definition:** We say "yes" to people we consider part of our group.

**How It Works:**
- Shared identity creates trust and cooperation
- "We" language signals group membership
- Common goals unite disparate stakeholders

**In Business Writing:**
- Use "we" instead of "I" or "you"
- Emphasize common goals: "Our shared objective is..."
- Reference team identity: "As members of the product team..."
- Frame as collaboration: "Together we can..."

**Example:**
"As members of the sales organization, we all benefit when customer retention improves. This initiative helps all of us hit our Q2 targets by reducing churn from 15% to 10%."

<speaker-notes>
Unity is the newest principle Cialdini added after studying what makes people act together. It's particularly relevant in cross-functional business settings where you need buy-in from multiple groups. "We" language is powerful—it creates inclusion and shared ownership. Bad memo: "I need your help to implement this." Good memo: "As the product launch team, we share the goal of a smooth rollout. Here's how we can ensure success together." Vietnamese context: Collective culture values "we" thinking—this principle aligns exceptionally well with Vietnamese business culture.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Applying Multiple Principles">

## Using Multiple Principles Together

**Scenario:** Requesting manager approval for $500 conference attendance.

**❌ Weak Memo (No Principles):**
"I'd like to attend the Digital Marketing Summit. It looks interesting and I think it would be beneficial."

**✅ Strong Memo (Multiple Principles):**
"I'd like to attend the Digital Marketing Summit on May 15th. Here's why this benefits our team:

- **[Social Proof]** Three competitors will be presenting case studies on Southeast Asian markets—insights we can apply immediately.
- **[Authority]** Keynote speaker is HubSpot's APAC Director, whose framework we've already started using.
- **[Reciprocity]** I'll share key takeaways with the team in a 30-minute workshop the following week.
- **[Scarcity]** Early bird registration ends April 10th ($200 savings).

**Request:** Approve $500 registration by April 8th."

<speaker-notes>
Same request, dramatically different persuasive power. Weak version is vague, self-centered ("I think," "It looks"). Strong version uses four principles explicitly. Social Proof: "Three competitors"—shows industry relevance, creates FOMO. Authority: Name-drops credible expert reader recognizes. Reciprocity: Offers value back ("I'll share takeaways"). Scarcity: Creates deadline urgency. Notice specific numbers ($500, April 10th, 30-minute) versus vague language. Student applied this to internship request email: cited professor endorsement (authority), mentioned limited spots (scarcity), offered to share learnings with classmates (reciprocity). Result: interview within 24 hours.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="28" layout="content" title="Case Study: $2M Budget Approval">

## Real Example: Software Investment Proposal

**Context:** Mid-level manager proposing $2M enterprise software investment to CFO.

**Key Persuasion Elements:**

**SCQA Structure:**
- **S:** Current system handles 100 users
- **C:** Company grew to 500 users, system crashes weekly
- **Q:** How do we prevent productivity loss and data risk?
- **A:** Invest $2M in scalable cloud solution

**Cialdini Principles:**
- **Authority:** "Gartner ranks this as #1 enterprise solution"
- **Social Proof:** "15 Fortune 500 companies migrated last year"
- **Scarcity:** "Vendor offering 20% discount through Q2 only"
- **Reciprocity:** "I've prepared a 90-day migration plan to minimize disruption"

**Pyramid Structure:** Three supporting reasons—productivity, security, scalability.

**Outcome:** CFO approved full budget within two weeks.

<speaker-notes>
This is an anonymized version of a real investment memo. $2M is significant budget—required compelling case. Notice how structure (SCQA plus Pyramid) and psychology (Cialdini) work together. SCQA creates narrative urgency—system crashes equal real problem. Authority and Social Proof reduce perceived risk—Gartner, Fortune 500. Scarcity creates deadline pressure—Q2 discount. Reciprocity shows writer did the work—migration plan ready. Pyramid structure makes decision easy—three clear reasons with supporting data. Total memo: 2 pages—executives appreciate brevity.

## Persuasion: Apply the Six Principles

**Reciprocity** — Give value first

**Commitment & Consistency** — Reference past agreements

**Social Proof** — Show others agree

**Authority** — Cite credible sources

**Liking** — Build connection

**Scarcity** — Emphasize urgency

**Unity** — Use "we" language

**Next:** Style and revision strategies.

<speaker-notes>
Let's consolidate Segment 2. Persuasion psychology dramatically increases your writing's effectiveness. Reciprocity: offer value before making requests—share insights, prepare analysis, provide solutions. Commitment and Consistency: reference past agreements and stated goals. Social Proof: show others have adopted your idea—"Three departments already using this" or "Industry leaders recommend this approach." Authority: cite credible sources and establish your expertise—reference research, quote experts, demonstrate competence. Liking: build rapport through shared interests and positive tone. Scarcity: emphasize urgency and limited windows—deadlines, unique opportunities. Unity: use "we" language and shared goals. For your Business Memo: identify which two or three principles fit your scenario naturally, then weave them into your argument.

## Segment 3: Writing with Impact

**Focus:** Neuroscience-backed style techniques and revision frameworks

**Frameworks:**
- The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing (Birchard, HBR 2021)
- "What? So What? Now What?" Revision Method (Abrahams, Stanford GSB)

**Goal:** Turn good drafts into compelling final products.

<speaker-notes>
Segment 3 covers style and revision—the finishing techniques that transform good drafts into excellent final products. We'll explore two frameworks: Bill Birchard's 8 S's from Harvard Business Review, based on neuroscience research about how brains process written content. And Matt Abrahams' "What? So What? Now What?" revision framework from Stanford Graduate School of Business. These aren't opinions—they're evidence-based techniques backed by brain science and MBA-level curriculum. The 8 S's activate the brain's reward circuit, making your writing more engaging and persuasive.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="31" layout="framework" title="The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing">

## Bill Birchard's 8 S's (HBR, 2021)

**Eight features that activate the brain's reward circuit:**

1. **Simplicity** — Short sentences, familiar words
2. **Specificity** — Concrete words beat abstract ("pelican" beats "bird")
3. **Surprise** — Unexpected content creates engagement
4. **Stirring Language** — Emotional connotation (processed in 200 milliseconds)
5. **Seductiveness** — Build anticipation
6. **Smart Thinking** — Create "aha moments"
7. **Social Content** — Include human angles
8. **Storytelling** — Even 12-second narratives activate reward regions

**Source:** Birchard, B. (2021, July–August). The science of strong business writing. *Harvard Business Review*, 99(4).

<speaker-notes>
These eight features are backed by neuroscience research from Princeton, Wharton, UC Santa Barbara. Not opinions—empirical findings about how brains process written content. Use this as a revision checklist for any business document. Simplicity: Reduces cognitive load—readers more likely to agree. Specificity: Concrete words activate more neurons than abstract ones. Surprise: Brain makes predictions; unexpected content equals engagement. Stirring Language: Emotional connotations processed faster than meaning. Seductiveness: Anticipation equals dopamine release. Smart Thinking: Make reader feel intelligent. Social Content: Use "you," include human angles. Storytelling: Narratives activate extensive brain regions.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="32" layout="content" title="S1: Simplicity">

## S1: Simplicity

**Definition:** Short sentences and familiar words reduce cognitive load.

**Why It Works:**
- Processing fluency—easier to read equals more believable
- Readers can focus on content, not decoding language
- Executives appreciate brevity

**In Business Writing:**
- Target 15-20 words per sentence average
- Replace jargon with plain language
- Eliminate nominalizations: "implement" not "implementation of"
- Cut unnecessary qualifiers: "very," "quite," "rather"

**Before:** "The implementation of the aforementioned customer relationship management system will facilitate the optimization of operational efficiency."

**After:** "The new CRM will cut response time by 40%."

<speaker-notes>
Simplicity doesn't mean dumbing down—it means respecting the reader's time. Complex language creates cognitive load; readers have to work harder to understand. That effort makes them less likely to agree with your argument. Nominalizations are when you turn verbs into nouns: "make a decision" becomes "decide," "conduct an analysis" becomes "analyze." Vietnamese learners often add these because they sound more formal. In business English, simpler is better. Hemingway Editor is a free tool that highlights complex sentences—aim for Grade 8-9 readability for executive audiences.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="33" layout="content" title="S2: Specificity">

## S2: Specificity

**Definition:** Concrete words activate more brain regions than abstract ones.

**Why It Works:**
- Concrete words trigger sensory and motor cortex
- Numbers are more memorable than adjectives
- Specificity builds credibility

**In Business Writing:**
- Replace adjectives with numbers: "40% increase" not "significant improvement"
- Use concrete nouns: "MacBook" not "device"
- Include specific details: names, dates, amounts
- Avoid vague qualifiers: "many," "several," "soon," "recently"

**Before:** "We saw significant improvement in customer satisfaction recently."

**After:** "Customer satisfaction rose from 72% to 89% in Q1 2024."

<speaker-notes>
Specificity makes writing credible and memorable. When you write "bird," the reader's brain activates general concepts. When you write "pelican," the brain activates visual imagery, motor memory, and associated experiences. That deeper processing makes the content stick. In business writing, specificity equals credibility. "Sales improved" is vague—improved by how much? From what baseline? When? "Sales increased 23% YoY, from $1.2M to $1.5M" is specific and convincing. Vietnamese context: Some students avoid specifics to hedge or maintain flexibility. In Western business writing, vagueness undermines credibility.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="34" layout="content" title="S3: Surprise & S4: Stirring Language">

## S3: Surprise

**Definition:** Unexpected content violates predictions and creates engagement.

**Application:**
- Lead with counterintuitive findings
- Subvert expectations in opening lines
- Include unexpected statistics or quotes

**Example:** "Our biggest competitor isn't who you think—it's customer inertia."

---

## S4: Stirring Language

**Definition:** Words with emotional connotation processed in 200 milliseconds—faster than meaning.

**Application:**
- Choose active, vivid verbs: "accelerate" not "improve"
- Frame positively: "unlock savings" not "reduce costs"
- Use power words: "transform," "breakthrough," "proven"

**Example:** "Let's accelerate growth" beats "Let's try to improve performance"

<speaker-notes>
Surprise and Stirring Language both create emotional engagement. Surprise: The brain constantly predicts what's coming next. When predictions are violated, engagement spikes. That's why "65% of decisions are influenced by writing" works as a hook—it's surprising. Stirring Language: Emotional connotations are processed incredibly fast. "Cut costs" and "unlock savings" mean similar things, but "unlock savings" feels positive and energizing. Be careful not to oversell—"revolutionary paradigm shift" sounds like marketing fluff. Use stirring language strategically, not constantly.

<slide number="35" layout="content" title="8 S's in Action: Before & After">

## Transforming Flat Writing

**❌ BEFORE (Weak Style):**
"The implementation of the new customer relationship management system will facilitate improved operational efficiency and enhance our ability to serve clients in a more effective manner going forward."

**Problems:** Abstract nouns, vague adjectives, wordy (28 words), passive

---

**✅ AFTER (8 S's Applied):**
"The new CRM will cut response time by 40% and help us win back lost clients."

**Why Better:**
- **Simplicity:** 15 words vs. 28
- **Specificity:** "40%" vs. "improved efficiency"
- **Stirring Language:** "win back" vs. "serve more effectively"
- **Social Content:** "clients" as humans, not abstract "operational efficiency"

<speaker-notes>
Classic example of corporate jargon versus clear business writing. Before version: sounds professional but says nothing memorable. After version: same information, half the words, triple the impact. Simplicity: Eliminate nominalizations ("implementation of" becomes "implement"). Specificity: Replace vague adjectives with numbers ("improved" becomes "40%"). Stirring Language: Active verbs ("cut," "win") beat passive constructions. Social Content: "Clients" are people, not abstractions. Vietnamese context: Academic English often teaches formal, wordy style. Business English values brevity and directness.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="36" layout="framework" title="What? So What? Now What?">

## Matt Abrahams — Stanford GSB Strategic Communication

**Revision Framework for Any Business Communication:**

**WHAT?** — The information, idea, or belief you're conveying

**SO WHAT?** — The relevance for your audience; the value your idea brings

**NOW WHAT?** — What comes next; the specific action you want

---

**Before Writing:** Answer all three questions to clarify purpose.

**After Writing:** Check if your draft answers all three clearly.

**Source:** Abrahams, M. (2023). Class takeaways — Essentials of strategic communication. *Stanford Graduate School of Business Insights*.

<speaker-notes>
Matt Abrahams teaches Strategic Communication at Stanford GSB—this is MBA-level curriculum. "What? So What? Now What?" simplifies Minto's Pyramid into three memorable questions. Use this as a revision checklist. WHAT: The core message—your SCQA Answer, your Pyramid apex. SO WHAT: Why should reader care? What's the benefit? Answers "Why does this matter to me?" NOW WHAT: Clear next step—what do you want reader to do? Most weak memos answer WHAT but forget SO WHAT and NOW WHAT. Reader left thinking "Okay, interesting... but what am I supposed to do with this?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="37" layout="content" title="Case Study: Revision in Action">

## Before & After: Project Update Memo

**❌ DRAFT VERSION:**
"The integration project is progressing. We have completed several key milestones and are working on the remaining tasks. There have been some challenges, but the team is addressing them. We expect to finish soon."

**Problems:**
- Vague ("progressing," "several," "some," "soon")
- No WHAT/SO WHAT/NOW WHAT
- Passive voice
- No Cialdini principles
- Violates Simplicity and Specificity

---

**✅ REVISED VERSION:**
"**[WHAT]** The integration is 80% complete—8 of 10 modules deployed successfully.

**[SO WHAT]** We're on track to launch by Q2, enabling $2M in projected cost savings for the finance team.

**[COMPLICATION]** Module 9 requires an additional $5K for third-party API access.

**[NOW WHAT]** Please approve the $5K expense by Friday so we stay on schedule and hit our Q2 launch target."

<speaker-notes>
This is a real before/after from a project management context. Draft version is what most people write—sounds professional but conveys nothing. Revised version uses every framework from today. Structure: SCQA framework—Situation/Complication implicit, Question "What do we need?", Answer "Approve $5K." Specificity: 80%, 8 of 10, $2M, $5K, Q2, Friday—all concrete. So What: Finance team benefits—makes it relevant to audience. Now What: Clear request with deadline. Cialdini: Scarcity (Friday deadline), Social Proof (finance team context). 8 S's: Simplicity (shorter), Specificity (numbers), Social Content (finance team).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="38" layout="content" title="Tone: Word Choice Matters">

## The Power of Stirring Language

**Scenario:** Proposing cost-cutting initiative

---

**❌ Weak Tone (Abstract, Passive):**
"Cost reduction measures should be implemented to improve financial performance."

**Problems:** Passive voice, abstract, no emotional engagement

---

**✅ Strong Tone (Active, Specific, Stirring):**
"Let's cut unnecessary expenses by 15% this quarter—freeing up budget to hire two analysts and accelerate growth."

**Why Better:**
- Active voice: "Let's cut" vs. "should be implemented"
- Specific number: 15%
- Positive reframe: "freeing up budget" vs. "cost reduction"
- Human benefit: "hire two analysts"
- Stirring word: "accelerate" vs. "improve"

<speaker-notes>
Tone is not just politeness—it's strategic persuasion. Same idea, different emotional response based on word choice. Birchard's research: emotional connotations processed in 200 milliseconds—faster than meaning. Weak version: Sounds bureaucratic, uninspiring, forgettable. Strong version: Sounds collaborative ("Let's"), action-oriented ("cut," "accelerate"), human ("hire two analysts"). Positive framing: "freeing up budget" beats "cost reduction"—same thing, different feeling. Vietnamese context: English has many synonyms with different connotations. Choose active, positive words.

<slide number="39" layout="content" title="Revision Checklist">

## Your Memo Revision Protocol

**Step 1: Structure Check**
- ✓ Does it open with SCQA?
- ✓ Is the main recommendation in the first paragraph?
- ✓ Are supporting reasons organized in Pyramid structure?

**Step 2: Persuasion Check**
- ✓ Have I used 2+ Cialdini principles explicitly?
- ✓ Is there a clear "because" for my request?
- ✓ Does it answer "What? So What? Now What?"

**Step 3: Style Check**
- ✓ Are numbers specific (not "many," "soon," "improved")?
- ✓ Is it written in active voice?
- ✓ Have I cut unnecessary words (aim for -20% from draft)?
- ✓ Does it include "you" or "we" language (social content)?

**Step 4: Proofread**
- ✓ Read aloud—does it sound natural?
- ✓ Grammarly check for errors
- ✓ Peer review (tutorial workshop!)

<speaker-notes>
This is your quality control checklist—use before submitting any persuasive document. Print this slide; keep it next to your computer when revising. Step 1: Structure first—if organization is wrong, everything else fails. Step 2: Persuasion psychology—are you leveraging Cialdini's principles? Step 3: Style—apply the 8 S's, especially Simplicity and Specificity. Step 4: Mechanics—grammar matters, but it's the last step. Content first, polish last. Peer review catches errors you'll miss—you're too close to your own writing.

## Putting It All Together

**To:** Department Head
**From:** Marketing Coordinator
**Subject:** Request for $3K Social Media Advertising Budget

---

**[SCQA + Pyramid Opening]:**

**[S]** Our Instagram following grew from 5,000 to 12,000 in six months using organic content alone. **[C]** However, engagement has plateaued at 2% for the past two months—below our 5% target needed to drive sales conversions. **[Q]** How can we reignite growth and hit our sales targets? **[A]** I recommend allocating $3,000 for targeted social media ads in Q2.

**[Pyramid Structure - Three Reasons]:**

1. **ROI Proven [Authority]:** Industry benchmarks show a 400% ROI on social ads in our sector (source: Hootsuite 2024 Report).
2. **Competitors Active [Social Proof]:** Three direct competitors launched paid campaigns last quarter and gained 20K+ followers each.
3. **Timing Critical [Scarcity]:** Q2 coincides with peak buying season—missing this window means waiting until Q4.

**[Reciprocity]:** I've drafted a 60-day campaign plan with A/B testing protocols to maximize budget efficiency (attached).

**[Now What]:** Please approve this $3K expense by March 15th so we can launch by April 1st and capture Q2 momentum.

<speaker-notes>
This memo integrates every framework from today's lecture. Notice how natural it reads—frameworks are invisible to reader but create persuasive power. Total length: under 200 words—executives love brevity. SCQA: Situation equals growth to 12K, Complication equals engagement plateau, Question equals how to reignite, Answer equals $3K ads. Pyramid: Three supporting reasons—ROI, competitors, timing. Cialdini: Authority (Hootsuite data), Social Proof (competitors), Scarcity (Q2 window), Reciprocity (campaign plan attached). 8 S's: Specific numbers (5K, 12K, 2%, $3K, 400%, 20K), Active voice, Social content. What/So What/Now What: What equals need ads, So What equals hit sales targets, Now What equals approve by March 15.

<slide number="45" layout="quote" title="Final Thought">

> "When it comes to our communication, many of us make a fundamental mistake. We start from the wrong place. We start by saying, 'This is what I want to say,' rather than thinking about what our audience needs to hear."

— Matt Abrahams, Stanford GSB

**Your Challenge:** Revise your memo draft using today's frameworks. Ask "What does my reader need to know, feel, and do?"

**See you in tutorial for peer review.**

<speaker-notes>
Abrahams captures the core shift in mindset for persuasive writing. Most people write from their perspective; effective writers start with audience. Audience-first thinking: What does reader need? Not what do I want to say? This applies to every framework today: SCQA creates relevance, Cialdini triggers audience psychology, 8 S's create brain-friendly writing. Revision challenge: Read your draft and ask "Why should my reader care?" Tutorial brings draft—even rough version is fine. Peer feedback will improve your grade significantly—average plus 8%. Thank you. See you in tutorial—bring your draft and a willingness to give and receive feedback.
