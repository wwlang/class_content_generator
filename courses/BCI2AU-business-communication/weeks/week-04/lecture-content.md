## OPENING

### Slide 1: Hook
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->
## 65% of Business Decisions
Are Influenced by the **Written Word**

Not just the idea—the way it's written.

(McKinsey Global Survey, 2023)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome to Week 4—this is a critical week where your first major assessment is due
- We've moved from understanding audiences to writing clearly; now we persuade

**Key Points:**
- McKinsey research shows most major decisions depend on persuasive documents: memos, proposals, business cases
- Even brilliant ideas fail if poorly communicated in writing
- Your memo assignment (due this week) puts this into practice
- Today's frameworks will serve you for years—consulting firms teach these to new hires

**Example:**
- Real scenario: Two teams pitch same idea to CEO. Team A writes dense 3-page memo. Team B uses structure from today (Pyramid Principle, SCQA). Team B approved in 48 hours. Team A memo sits unread for weeks.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick show of hands—who's had an email ignored or misunderstood? That's what we're fixing today."

**Transition:**
- "Let's see exactly what makes persuasive writing work..."

---

### Slide 2: Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the Pyramid Principle and SCQA framework to structure persuasive memos
2. **Integrate** Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence into business writing
3. **Evaluate** tone and style choices using the 8 S's framework
4. **Revise** written drafts using the "What? So What? Now What?" method

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Four specific, actionable frameworks today—you'll use all four in your memo

**Key Points:**
- **Objective 1:** Structure—how to organize arguments (Minto's Pyramid, SCQA)
- **Objective 2:** Persuasion psychology—why people say yes (Cialdini)
- **Objective 3:** Style—making writing clear and compelling (Birchard's 8 S's)
- **Objective 4:** Revision—turning good drafts into great final products (Abrahams)
- These aren't abstract theories—Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and consulting firms teach these

**Example:**
- Barbara Minto developed the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey in the 1960s. It's still the firm standard today. "Make it Minto" is common feedback at BCG, Bain, Accenture.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which objective sounds most useful to you right now as you work on your memo?"

**Transition:**
- "Before we dive in, let's be clear about how today connects to your grade..."

### Slide 3: Assessment Connection — CRITICAL WEEK
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Your Business Memo is Due This Week (10%)

**Timeline:**
- **Today (Lecture):** Learn persuasive writing frameworks
- **Tutorial:** Peer review workshop—bring your draft
- **By End of Week:** Submit final memo via Moodle (11:59 PM deadline)

**What's Next:**
- **Week 5-7:** Prepare Persuasive Proposal (15%)—builds on today's frameworks
- The structure you learn today applies to both assignments

⚠️ **Tutorial Attendance Mandatory:** Peer feedback significantly improves final grades (avg +8%)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is an assessment week—your memo is due at week's end
- Tutorial is not optional; peer review catches errors you'll miss on your own

**Key Points:**
- Business Memo worth 10%—first major portfolio piece
- Persuasive Proposal coming in 3 weeks (15%)—uses same frameworks
- Tutorial brings draft; you'll give and receive feedback using today's frameworks
- Past data: students who attend peer review score average 8% higher than those who skip
- Vietnamese context: Feedback culture may feel direct, but it's how professionals improve

**Example:**
- Last semester: Student submitted memo without peer review. Lost 3 marks for unclear request and missing SCQA structure—both caught by peers in workshop.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Who has a draft ready for tutorial? Even a rough version is fine—that's what workshops are for."

**Transition:**
- "Let's see what makes a memo persuasive. Here's our roadmap..."

### Slide 4: Today's Roadmap
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Three Segments (60 Minutes)

**Segment 1:** Structure — The Pyramid Principle & SCQA (20 min)

**Segment 2:** Persuasion Psychology — Cialdini's Six Principles (20 min)

**Segment 3:** Style & Revision — The 8 S's and "What? So What? Now What?" (20 min)

---

## CORE CONTENT

### SEGMENT 1: STRUCTURE (20 min, 6 slides)

---

### Slide 5: Segment 1 Introduction
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Segment 1: The Architecture of Persuasion

**Focus:** How to structure arguments so busy readers say "yes"

**Frameworks:**
- The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, McKinsey)
- SCQA Framework (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)

---

### Slide 6: The Problem with Most Business Writing

**How most people write memos:**

1. Background context (3 paragraphs)
2. History of the problem (2 paragraphs)
3. Analysis details (5 paragraphs)
4. Recommendation (buried in final paragraph)

**Result:** Executive skims first page, loses interest, never reads recommendation.

**Better way:** Start with the answer.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Most business writing is structured like a mystery novel—answer revealed at the end
- Works for fiction; fails for executives with 200 emails per day

**Key Points:**
- Traditional academic writing: build up to conclusion (thesis at end)
- Business writing: conclusion first, supporting details follow
- Executives often read only the first paragraph—make it count
- Vietnamese context: some students taught to "build suspense" in writing. In business, suspense = ignored memos.

**Example:**
- CEO receives two memos. Memo A: "After analyzing market trends, reviewing competitor strategies, and consulting stakeholders, we recommend..." CEO stops reading. Memo B: "We should acquire Company X for $50M. Here's why in 3 points." CEO keeps reading.

**Check Understanding:**
- "What structure were you taught in school—conclusion first or conclusion last?"

**Transition:**
- "The solution to this problem comes from Barbara Minto at McKinsey..."

---

### Slide 7: The Pyramid Principle
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, 1987)

**Idea:**
Ideas organized hierarchically—main conclusion at apex, supporting arguments below, evidence at base.

**Core Principle:** **Start with the answer.**

**Structure:**
```
         [MAIN RECOMMENDATION]
                 |
    ____________________________
    |            |             |
[Reason 1]  [Reason 2]   [Reason 3]
    |            |             |
[Evidence]  [Evidence]   [Evidence]
```

**Application:** Executive summaries, board memos, consulting reports, your Business Memo.

**Source:** Minto, B. (2021). *The Pyramid Principle* (3rd ed.). Pearson. [Standard at McKinsey, BCG, Bain]

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Barbara Minto was first female consultant hired at McKinsey (1963)
- Developed this to help consultants communicate clearly to clients
- Now the global standard for business writing

**Key Points:**
- **Pyramid structure:** Top = what you want reader to know/do. Middle = why (3-5 reasons). Bottom = supporting evidence.
- **Why it works:** Reader gets decision immediately, can drill into details if needed
- **MECE principle:** Reasons must be Mutually Exclusive (no overlap), Collectively Exhaustive (nothing missing)
- Applies to full documents and individual paragraphs

**Example:**
- Your memo recommending budget approval:
  - **Top:** "Approve $10,000 for new CRM system"
  - **Middle:** Three reasons—improves sales tracking, reduces admin time, integrates with current tools
  - **Bottom:** Data showing 20% efficiency gain, ROI analysis, vendor comparison

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about your memo draft—what's your main recommendation? That should be sentence one."

**Transition:**
- "The Pyramid tells you *how* to structure. Now let's look at *how to open* with SCQA..."

---

### Slide 8: SCQA Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## SCQA: Crafting Compelling Openings

**Four-part introduction structure that engages readers immediately.**

**S = Situation** — Context the reader already knows (undisputed facts)

**C = Complication** — What has changed; why action is needed now

**Q = Question** — The explicit issue to address

**A = Answer** — Your solution/recommendation (this is your Pyramid apex)

**Source:** Derived from Minto's Pyramid Principle; widely used in consulting communications.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- SCQA is the "on-ramp" to your Pyramid structure
- Creates engagement before you present recommendation
- Avoids starting with boring context or obvious background

**Key Points:**
- **Situation:** Start with agreement—facts no one disputes
- **Complication:** Introduce tension, problem, or opportunity
- **Question:** Make the reader's question explicit
- **Answer:** Your recommendation (then support with Pyramid structure)
- This creates a narrative flow—reader wants to keep reading

**Example (Budget Memo):**
- **S:** "Our sales team has grown from 5 to 15 people in two years."
- **C:** "But we're still using a spreadsheet to track leads, causing missed follow-ups and lost deals."
- **Q:** "How can we scale our sales process without losing opportunities?"
- **A:** "Invest $10,000 in a cloud CRM system that integrates with our current tools."

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can someone identify the Complication in their own memo topic?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see SCQA in a real business memo example..."

---

### Slide 9: SCQA Example — Real Business Memo
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Case Study: New Hire Request Memo

**To:** Department Head
**From:** Team Lead
**Subject:** Request for Two Additional Analysts

---

**Opening Paragraph (SCQA):**

**[S]** Our analytics team currently consists of three analysts supporting five product lines across Southeast Asia. **[C]** However, two new markets (Thailand and Indonesia) launched last quarter, and response times for client requests have doubled from 48 hours to 96 hours. **[Q]** How do we maintain service quality while supporting regional expansion? **[A]** I recommend hiring two junior analysts by Q2 to prevent client dissatisfaction and retain current team members who are at risk of burnout.

**Supporting Pyramid:**
- **Reason 1:** Workload data shows 180% capacity
- **Reason 2:** Two clients complained about delays
- **Reason 3:** ROI analysis shows hires pay for themselves in 8 months

---

**Result:** Approved within one week.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is a real memo format from a regional tech company (anonymized)
- Notice how SCQA creates urgency without being alarmist

**Key Points:**
- **Situation** establishes current state (3 analysts, 5 product lines)
- **Complication** introduces problem (new markets, doubled response time)
- **Question** frames what reader is already wondering
- **Answer** states recommendation clearly
- After SCQA, memo continues with Pyramid structure supporting the three reasons
- Total memo length: 1 page (executives love brevity)

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Some cultures prefer indirect requests ("Perhaps we might consider..."). In Western business writing, direct requests perform better. "I recommend X" beats "It might be beneficial to explore X."

**Check Understanding:**
- "What would happen if this memo started with 'Since 2020, our company has been growing...'?" [Answer: reader loses interest before reaching the problem]

**Transition:**
- "Structure is critical—but even perfect structure fails without persuasion psychology..."

---

### Slide 10: Segment 1 Takeaway
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Structure: Start with the Answer

**The Pyramid Principle:** Main recommendation first, then supporting reasons, then evidence.

**SCQA Framework:** Situation → Complication → Question → Answer.

**Your Memo:** Use SCQA to open, Pyramid to organize.

**Next:** Why people say "yes"—Cialdini's Six Principles.

---

### SEGMENT 2: PERSUASION PSYCHOLOGY (20 min, 6 slides)

---

### Slide 11: Segment 2 Introduction
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Segment 2: The Science of Influence

**Focus:** Evidence-based persuasion techniques from 35+ years of research

**Framework:** Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence

**Application:** Ethical persuasion in business writing

---

### Slide 12: Robert Cialdini — The Science of Persuasion
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason."

— Robert Cialdini, *Influence: Science and Practice* (2009)

**Key Insight:** Even weak reasons increase compliance. "Because" is a persuasive word.

**Credentials:**
- PhD, Social Psychology (University of North Carolina)
- American Academy of Arts & Sciences (2018)
- National Academy of Sciences (2019)
- Consulting clients: Google, Microsoft, IBM
- Taught at Stanford, Harvard Kennedy School

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Cialdini spent 35 years researching what makes people say "yes"
- His work is empirical—based on experiments, not opinions
- *Influence* appears on Warren Buffett's recommended reading list and Fortune's "75 Smartest Business Books"

**Key Points:**
- The "because" study: "Can I cut in line?" vs. "Can I cut in line because I'm in a rush?" Compliance doubled.
- Even trivial reasons work—humans respond to the word "because" as a persuasion trigger
- Cialdini's six principles apply to writing, sales, negotiation, marketing
- Vietnamese context: These are universal psychological principles, not culturally specific

**Example:**
- Email subject line test: "Meeting request" vs. "Meeting request—need your expertise on Q2 strategy." Second version gets 40% more responses because it includes a reason ("your expertise").

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about requests you've received recently—did they include a 'because'?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at the six principles you can use in your memos..."

---

### Slide 13: The Six Principles of Influence
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Cialdini's Six Principles

1. **Reciprocity** — People feel obligated to return favors
2. **Commitment & Consistency** — People align with past statements
3. **Social Proof** — People follow others' actions
4. **Authority** — People defer to credible experts
5. **Liking** — People are persuaded by those they like
6. **Scarcity** — Limited availability increases value

**Source:** Cialdini, R. B. (2009). *Influence: Science and Practice* (5th ed.). Pearson. [2,308+ citations]

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- These are not manipulation tricks—they're ethical persuasion techniques based on human psychology
- You already use these unconsciously; today makes them conscious tools

**Key Points:**
- **Reciprocity:** Give before you ask (offer insights, then request meeting)
- **Commitment:** Reference past agreements ("As we discussed in Q1...")
- **Social Proof:** Show others have adopted your idea ("Three departments already using this")
- **Authority:** Cite credible sources, establish your expertise early
- **Liking:** Build rapport through shared interests, positive tone
- **Scarcity:** Emphasize deadlines, unique opportunities, limited windows
- Each principle triggers automatic psychological responses

**Example:**
- Vietnamese e-commerce example: Shopee flash sales combine scarcity (countdown timer), social proof ("X people bought this"), and reciprocity (free shipping voucher upfront)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which principle do you see most often in advertising?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's apply these to business writing with specific examples..."

---

### Slide 14: Applying Cialdini to Memos — Examples

**Scenario:** You want your manager to approve attending a $500 conference.

**❌ Weak Memo (No Principles):**
"I'd like to attend the Digital Marketing Summit. It looks interesting and I think it would be beneficial."

**✅ Strong Memo (Multiple Principles):**

"I'd like to attend the Digital Marketing Summit on May 15th. Here's why this benefits our team:

- **[Social Proof]** Three competitors will be presenting case studies on Southeast Asian markets—insights we can apply immediately.
- **[Authority]** Keynote speaker is HubSpot's APAC Director, whose framework we've already started using.
- **[Reciprocity]** I'll share key takeaways with the team in a 30-minute workshop the following week.
- **[Scarcity]** Early bird registration ends April 10th ($200 savings).

**Request:** Approve $500 registration by April 8th."

**Result:** Manager can see value, urgency, and return on investment.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Same request, dramatically different persuasive power
- Weak version is vague, self-centered ("I think," "It looks")
- Strong version uses four principles explicitly

**Key Points:**
- **Social Proof:** "Three competitors"—shows industry relevance, FOMO
- **Authority:** Name-drops credible expert reader recognizes
- **Reciprocity:** Offers value back ("I'll share takeaways")
- **Scarcity:** Creates deadline urgency
- Notice specific numbers ($500, April 10th, 30-minute) vs. vague language
- Vietnamese context: Direct request at end ("Approve $500 by April 8th") may feel bold, but Western business writing values clarity

**Example:**
- Student applied this to internship request email: cited professor endorsement (authority), mentioned limited spots (scarcity), offered to share learnings with classmates (reciprocity). Result: interview within 24 hours.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which principle would you add to your current memo draft?"

**Transition:**
- "Principles 1-4 we've covered. Let's look at Liking and Unity..."

---

### Slide 15: Liking and Unity — Building Connection

## Principle 5: Liking
"We like people who are similar to us. We like people who pay us compliments. We like people who cooperate with us toward mutual goals."

**In Business Writing:**
- Find common ground: "As a fellow alumnus of NEU..."
- Acknowledge shared challenges: "I know Q2 has been demanding for everyone..."
- Maintain positive, respectful tone throughout

---

## Principle 7: Unity (added in *Pre-Suasion*, 2016)
"We say 'yes' to people we consider part of our group."

**In Business Writing:**
- Use "we" language: "How can we solve this together?"
- Emphasize common goals: "Our shared objective is client satisfaction..."
- Reference team identity: "As the analytics team..."

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Liking and Unity both build relationship and connection through writing
- These are subtle but powerful—tone and word choice matter

**Key Points:**
- **Liking:** People persuaded by those they like—show you understand their perspective
- Common ground: shared alma mater, shared challenges, shared values
- Compliments work: "Your expertise in X makes you the ideal person to advise on this"
- Avoid excessive flattery (comes across as insincere)
- **Unity:** "We" beats "I" in persuasive writing—creates collaboration frame
- Vietnamese context: Collective culture already values "we" language; this aligns well

**Example:**
- Memo to cross-functional team: "As members of the product launch team, we all want a smooth rollout" (Unity) beats "I need your help with the launch" (individualistic, transactional)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Read your memo draft—count how many times you use 'I' vs. 'we.' Can you shift some to 'we'?"

**Transition:**
- "Six principles in your toolkit. Let's see them in action with one more case..."

---

### Slide 16: Case Study — Memo That Won $2M Budget
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Real Example: Software Investment Proposal

**Context:** Mid-level manager proposing $2M enterprise software investment to CFO.

**Key Persuasion Elements:**

1. **SCQA Structure:**
   - S: Current system handles 100 users
   - C: Company grew to 500 users, system crashes weekly
   - Q: How do we prevent productivity loss and data risk?
   - A: Invest $2M in scalable cloud solution

2. **Cialdini Principles:**
   - **Authority:** "Gartner ranks this as #1 enterprise solution"
   - **Social Proof:** "15 Fortune 500 companies migrated last year"
   - **Scarcity:** "Vendor offering 20% discount through Q2 only"
   - **Reciprocity:** "I've prepared a 90-day migration plan to minimize disruption"

3. **Pyramid Structure:** Three supporting reasons—productivity, security, scalability.

**Outcome:** CFO approved full budget within two weeks.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is an anonymized version of a real investment memo
- $2M is significant budget—required compelling case
- Notice how structure (SCQA + Pyramid) and psychology (Cialdini) work together

**Key Points:**
- **SCQA** creates narrative urgency (system crashes = real problem)
- **Authority** and **Social Proof** reduce perceived risk (Gartner, Fortune 500)
- **Scarcity** creates deadline pressure (Q2 discount)
- **Reciprocity** shows writer did the work (migration plan ready)
- Pyramid structure makes decision easy—three clear reasons with supporting data
- Total memo: 2 pages (executives appreciate brevity)

**Example:**
- What if this memo lacked structure? "Our system is old. We should buy new software. Here are some options..." CFO would ask for more analysis, delaying decision for months.

**Check Understanding:**
- "What would you add to make this even more persuasive?"

**Transition:**
- "Structure and psychology are essential—but even great content fails with poor style..."

---

### Slide 17: Segment 2 Takeaway
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Persuasion: Apply the Six Principles

**Reciprocity** — Give value first

**Social Proof** — Show others agree

**Authority** — Cite credible sources

**Scarcity** — Emphasize urgency

**Liking & Unity** — Build connection with "we" language

**Next:** Style and revision strategies.

---

### SEGMENT 3: STYLE & REVISION (20 min, 8 slides)

---

### Slide 18: Segment 3 Introduction
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Segment 3: Writing with Impact

**Focus:** Neuroscience-backed style techniques and revision frameworks

**Frameworks:**
- The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing (Birchard, HBR 2021)
- "What? So What? Now What?" Revision Method (Abrahams, Stanford GSB)

**Goal:** Turn good drafts into compelling final products.

---

### Slide 19: The 8 S's of Strong Business Writing
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Bill Birchard's 8 S's (HBR, 2021)

**Eight features that activate the brain's reward circuit:**

1. **Simplicity** — Short sentences, familiar words
2. **Specificity** — Concrete words beat abstract ("pelican" beats "bird")
3. **Surprise** — Unexpected content creates engagement
4. **Stirring Language** — Emotional connotation (processed in 200 milliseconds)
5. **Seductiveness** — Build anticipation
6. **Smart Thinking** — Create "aha moments"
7. **Social Content** — Include human angles
8. **Storytelling** — Even 12-second narratives activate reward regions

**Source:** Birchard, B. (2021, July–August). The science of strong business writing. *Harvard Business Review*, 99(4). https://hbr.org/2021/07/the-science-of-strong-business-writing

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- These eight features are backed by neuroscience research from Princeton, Wharton, UC Santa Barbara
- Not opinions—empirical findings about how brains process written content
- Use this as a revision checklist for any business document

**Key Points:**
- **Simplicity:** Reduces cognitive load ("processing fluency")—readers more likely to agree
- **Specificity:** Concrete words activate more neurons than abstract ones
- **Surprise:** Brain makes predictions; unexpected content = engagement (14% more likely to be shared)
- **Stirring Language:** Emotional connotations processed faster than meaning
- **Seductiveness:** Anticipation = "anticipatory utility" (dopamine release)
- **Smart Thinking:** Make reader feel intelligent ("aha!" moments)
- **Social Content:** Use "you," include human angles even in technical topics
- **Storytelling:** Narratives activate extensive brain regions (even brief 12-second stories)

**Example:**
- Jeff Bezos shareholder letter: "Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt. Badly." (Specificity + Stirring Language + Surprise) beats "We're facing competitive pressure from marketplace sellers."

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which of the 8 S's is hardest for you in your writing?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's apply these with before/after examples..."

---

### Slide 20: 8 S's in Action — Before & After
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

## Transforming Flat Writing into Engaging Writing

**❌ BEFORE (Weak Style):**
"The implementation of the new customer relationship management system will facilitate improved operational efficiency and enhance our ability to serve clients in a more effective manner going forward."

**Problems:** Abstract nouns ("implementation," "facilitation"), vague ("improved," "enhanced"), wordy (28 words)

---

**✅ AFTER (8 S's Applied):**
"The new CRM will cut response time by 40% and help us win back lost clients."

**Why Better:**
- **Simplicity:** 15 words vs. 28
- **Specificity:** "40%" vs. "improved efficiency"
- **Stirring Language:** "win back" vs. "serve more effectively"
- **Social Content:** "clients" as humans, not abstract "operational efficiency"

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Classic example of corporate jargon vs. clear business writing
- Before version: sounds professional but says nothing memorable
- After version: same information, half the words, triple the impact

**Key Points:**
- **Simplicity:** Eliminate nominalizations ("implementation of" → "implement")
- **Specificity:** Replace vague adjectives with numbers ("improved" → "40%")
- **Stirring Language:** Active verbs ("cut," "win") beat passive constructions
- **Social Content:** "Clients" are people, not abstractions
- Vietnamese context: Academic English often teaches formal, wordy style. Business English values brevity and directness.

**Example:**
- Common Vietnamese business English: "We are in the process of conducting an analysis..." Better: "We're analyzing..."

**Check Understanding:**
- "Find one sentence in your draft. Can you cut it by 30% without losing meaning?"

**Transition:**
- "Style improves drafts—but how do you revise systematically? Stanford's framework..."

---

### Slide 21: "What? So What? Now What?" Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Matt Abrahams — Stanford GSB Strategic Communication

**Revision Framework for Any Business Communication:**

**WHAT?** — The information, idea, or belief you're conveying

**SO WHAT?** — The relevance for your audience; the value your idea brings

**NOW WHAT?** — What comes next; the specific action you want

---

**Before Writing:** Answer all three questions to clarify purpose.

**After Writing:** Check if your draft answers all three clearly.

**Source:** Abrahams, M. (2023). Class takeaways — Essentials of strategic communication. *Stanford Graduate School of Business Insights*. https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/class-takeaways-essentials-strategic-communication

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Matt Abrahams teaches Strategic Communication at Stanford GSB—this is MBA-level curriculum
- "What? So What? Now What?" simplifies Minto's Pyramid into three memorable questions
- Use this as a revision checklist

**Key Points:**
- **WHAT:** The core message (your SCQA Answer, your Pyramid apex)
- **SO WHAT:** Why should reader care? What's the benefit? (Answers "Why does this matter to me?")
- **NOW WHAT:** Clear next step—what do you want reader to do?
- Most weak memos answer WHAT but forget SO WHAT and NOW WHAT
- Reader left thinking "Okay, interesting... but what am I supposed to do with this?"

**Example (Weak Memo):**
- WHAT: "Our website traffic increased 30% last quarter." [Okay, and...?]
- Missing SO WHAT: Why does this matter?
- Missing NOW WHAT: What should we do about it?

**Example (Strong Memo):**
- WHAT: "Our website traffic increased 30% last quarter."
- SO WHAT: "This confirms our SEO strategy is working, validating the $10K investment."
- NOW WHAT: "Let's double the budget for Q2 to capitalize on momentum."

**Check Understanding:**
- "Read your memo opening paragraph—can you identify What, So What, Now What?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see this in a complete revision example..."

---

### Slide 22: Case Study — Revision in Action
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Before & After: Project Update Memo

**❌ DRAFT VERSION:**

"The integration project is progressing. We have completed several key milestones and are working on the remaining tasks. There have been some challenges, but the team is addressing them. We expect to finish soon."

**Problems:**
- Vague ("progressing," "several," "some," "soon")
- No WHAT/SO WHAT/NOW WHAT
- Passive voice
- No Cialdini principles
- Violates Simplicity and Specificity (8 S's)

---

**✅ REVISED VERSION:**

"**[WHAT]** The integration is 80% complete—8 of 10 modules deployed successfully.

**[SO WHAT]** We're on track to launch by Q2, enabling $2M in projected cost savings for the finance team.

**[COMPLICATION]** Module 9 requires an additional $5K for third-party API access.

**[NOW WHAT]** Please approve the $5K expense by Friday so we stay on schedule and hit our Q2 launch target."

**Why Better:** Clear structure (SCQA), specific numbers (80%, $2M, $5K), direct request, shows benefit.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is a real before/after from a project management context
- Draft version is what most people write—sounds professional but conveys nothing
- Revised version uses every framework from today

**Key Points:**
- **Structure:** SCQA framework (Situation/Complication implicit, Question "What do we need?", Answer "Approve $5K")
- **Specificity:** 80%, 8 of 10, $2M, $5K, Q2, Friday (all concrete)
- **So What:** Finance team benefits—makes it relevant to audience
- **Now What:** Clear request with deadline
- **Cialdini:** Scarcity (Friday deadline), Social Proof (finance team context)
- 8 S's: Simplicity (shorter), Specificity (numbers), Social Content (finance team)

**Example:**
- Draft version might sit in inbox for days—no urgency, no clear ask
- Revised version demands response—specific deadline, clear benefit

**Check Understanding:**
- "What would happen if this memo kept the draft style?" [Answer: likely ignored or sent back for clarification]

**Transition:**
- "Final style tip—tone and word choice matter enormously..."

---

### Slide 23: Tone Matters — Word Choice Examples
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

## The Power of Stirring Language

**Scenario:** Proposing cost-cutting initiative

---

**❌ Weak Tone (Abstract, Passive):**
"Cost reduction measures should be implemented to improve financial performance."

**Problems:** Passive voice, abstract, no emotional engagement

---

**✅ Strong Tone (Active, Specific, Stirring):**
"Let's cut unnecessary expenses by 15% this quarter—freeing up budget to hire two analysts and accelerate growth."

**Why Better:**
- Active voice ("Let's cut" vs. "should be implemented")
- Specific number (15%)
- Positive reframe ("freeing up budget" vs. "cost reduction")
- Human benefit ("hire two analysts")
- Stirring word ("accelerate" vs. "improve")

**Principle:** Frame actions as opportunities, not obligations.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Tone is not just politeness—it's strategic persuasion
- Same idea, different emotional response based on word choice
- Birchard's research: emotional connotations processed in 200 milliseconds—faster than meaning

**Key Points:**
- **Weak version:** Sounds bureaucratic, uninspiring, forgettable
- **Strong version:** Sounds collaborative ("Let's"), action-oriented ("cut," "accelerate"), human ("hire two analysts")
- Positive framing: "freeing up budget" beats "cost reduction" (same thing, different feeling)
- Vietnamese context: English has many synonyms with different connotations. Choose active, positive words.

**Example:**
- Compare: "challenge the competition" (neutral) vs. "outwit rivals" (stirring)
- Both mean similar things, but "outwit" is memorable and energizing

**Check Understanding:**
- "Find one passive sentence in your draft. Rewrite it in active voice."

**Transition:**
- "One more critical revision technique..."

### Slide 24: Revision Checklist — Use This Before Submitting

## Your Memo Revision Protocol

**Step 1: Structure Check**
- ✓ Does it open with SCQA?
- ✓ Is the main recommendation in the first paragraph?
- ✓ Are supporting reasons organized in Pyramid structure?

**Step 2: Persuasion Check**
- ✓ Have I used 2+ Cialdini principles explicitly?
- ✓ Is there a clear "because" for my request?
- ✓ Does it answer "What? So What? Now What?"

**Step 3: Style Check**
- ✓ Are numbers specific (not "many," "soon," "improved")?
- ✓ Is it written in active voice?
- ✓ Have I cut unnecessary words (aim for -20% from draft)?
- ✓ Does it include "you" or "we" language (social content)?

**Step 4: Proofread**
- ✓ Read aloud—does it sound natural?
- ✓ Grammarly check for errors
- ✓ Peer review (tutorial workshop!)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This is your quality control checklist—use before submitting any persuasive document
- Print this slide; keep it next to your computer when revising

**Key Points:**
- **Step 1:** Structure first—if organization is wrong, everything else fails
- **Step 2:** Persuasion psychology—are you leveraging Cialdini's principles?
- **Step 3:** Style—apply the 8 S's (especially Simplicity and Specificity)
- **Step 4:** Mechanics—grammar matters, but it's the last step (content first, polish last)
- Peer review catches errors you'll miss (you're too close to your own writing)

**Example:**
- Student applied this checklist to conference request memo: realized she had no "So What" (why manager should care), added ROI data, got approved within 24 hours.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which step do you usually skip? That's probably where you lose the most points."

**Transition:**
- "Let's bring it all together with one final example..."

### Slide 25: Integration Example — Complete Persuasive Memo
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Putting It All Together

**To:** Department Head
**From:** Marketing Coordinator
**Subject:** Request for $3K Social Media Advertising Budget

---

**[SCQA + Pyramid Opening]:**

**[S]** Our Instagram following grew from 5,000 to 12,000 in six months using organic content alone. **[C]** However, engagement has plateaued at 2% for the past two months—below our 5% target needed to drive sales conversions. **[Q]** How can we reignite growth and hit our sales targets? **[A]** I recommend allocating $3,000 for targeted social media ads in Q2.

**[Pyramid Structure - Three Reasons]:**

1. **ROI Proven [Authority]:** Industry benchmarks show a 400% ROI on social ads in our sector (source: Hootsuite 2024 Report).
2. **Competitors Active [Social Proof]:** Three direct competitors launched paid campaigns last quarter and gained 20K+ followers each.
3. **Timing Critical [Scarcity]:** Q2 coincides with peak buying season—missing this window means waiting until Q4.

**[Reciprocity]:** I've drafted a 60-day campaign plan with A/B testing protocols to maximize budget efficiency (attached).

**[Now What]:** Please approve this $3K expense by March 15th so we can launch by April 1st and capture Q2 momentum.

**Frameworks Used:** SCQA, Pyramid, Cialdini (Authority, Social Proof, Scarcity, Reciprocity), 8 S's (Specificity, Simplicity), What/So What/Now What

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This memo integrates every framework from today's lecture
- Notice how natural it reads—frameworks are invisible to reader but create persuasive power
- Total length: under 200 words (executives love brevity)

**Key Points:**
- **SCQA:** S = growth to 12K, C = engagement plateau, Q = how to reignite, A = $3K ads
- **Pyramid:** Three supporting reasons (ROI, competitors, timing)
- **Cialdini:** Authority (Hootsuite data), Social Proof (competitors), Scarcity (Q2 window), Reciprocity (campaign plan attached)
- **8 S's:** Specific numbers (5K, 12K, 2%, $3K, 400%, 20K), Active voice, Social content ("our sales targets")
- **What/So What/Now What:** What = need ads, So What = hit sales targets, Now What = approve by March 15

**Example:**
- Result: Department head approved in two days. Why? Clear value proposition, minimal risk (proven ROI), urgency (Q2 timing), and all homework done (campaign plan ready).

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can you spot all four Cialdini principles in this memo?"

**Transition:**
- "That's the power of structured, evidence-based persuasive writing. Let's wrap up..."

### Slide 30: Final Thought
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "When it comes to our communication, many of us make a fundamental mistake. We start from the wrong place. We start by saying, 'This is what I want to say,' rather than thinking about what our audience needs to hear."

— Matt Abrahams, Stanford GSB

**Your Challenge:** Revise your memo draft using today's frameworks. Ask "What does my reader need to know, feel, and do?"

**See you in tutorial for peer review.**

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Abrahams captures the core shift in mindset for persuasive writing
- Most people write from their perspective; effective writers start with audience

**Key Points:**
- **Audience-first thinking:** What does reader need? (Not what do I want to say?)
- This applies to every framework today: SCQA (creates relevance), Cialdini (triggers audience psychology), 8 S's (brain-friendly writing)
- Revision challenge: Read your draft and ask "Why should my reader care?"
- Tutorial brings draft—even rough version is fine
- Peer feedback will improve your grade significantly (avg +8%)

**Example:**
- Student rewrote memo opening from "I am writing to request..." to "You asked for ideas to reduce costs—here's a solution that saves $50K annually." Same content, audience-first framing.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Who will revise their draft before tutorial using today's frameworks?"

**Transition:**
- "Thank you. See you in tutorial—bring your draft and a willingness to give and receive feedback. Questions now?"
