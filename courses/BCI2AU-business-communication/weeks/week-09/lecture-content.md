# Cross-Cultural & Team Communication

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 9. Today we explore how cultural differences shape communication and how to build effective teams across boundaries. This content prepares you for your group presentations in Week 12, where you'll work with teammates who may have different cultural backgrounds and communication styles.

# 89%

**of white-collar workers collaborate in global virtual teams**

*(CultureWizard Global Virtual Teams Survey, 2018)*

<speaker-notes>
Key moment - this statistic often surprises students who think cross-cultural communication only matters for international executives. The reality is that even entry-level professionals now work across borders, time zones, and cultural contexts daily. This is not a future skill; it's a present necessity.

Common student questions: "Does this include remote teams within Vietnam?" (Yes - even regional cultural differences matter) and "What about AI translation tools?" (Technology helps with language but not cultural norms).

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
1. **Apply** Hofstede's cultural dimensions to analyze communication differences across cultures
2. **Evaluate** team psychological safety using Edmondson's framework
3. **Design** culturally appropriate feedback using Meyer's Three A's approach
4. **Explain** how personal vs. contextual diversity impacts virtual team performance

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are testable - students will see questions on all four frameworks in the Week 9 quiz. Emphasize the connection to the group presentation: understanding cultural dimensions helps teams coordinate better, psychological safety enables honest collaboration, and the Three A's framework prevents feedback conflicts.

Objective 1 connects to Quiz Questions 1-3 (Hofstede). Objective 2 connects to Questions 4-6 (Edmondson). Objective 3 connects to Questions 7-9 (Meyer). Objective 4 connects to Questions 10-12 (Taras et al.).

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You

**Group Presentation (Due Week 12):** 15-minute team presentation + 10-minute Q&A
- **Today:** Learn cultural frameworks and team dynamics
- **Tutorial:** Practice cross-cultural feedback with peers
- **Week 10-11:** Apply frameworks to team coordination
- **Week 12:** Deliver cohesive team presentation

**Key application:** Understanding Power Distance helps you navigate hierarchy differences in your team. Psychological Safety helps you create an environment where all members contribute ideas.

<speaker-notes>
Students appreciate seeing the roadmap to assessment success. The group presentation is worth 40% combined (25% group + 15% individual), so effective team communication directly impacts their grade.

Practical example: A team with members from Vietnam (high Power Distance, PDI=70) and Australia (low Power Distance, PDI=36) may struggle if the senior member dominates. Today's frameworks help teams navigate these differences productively.

Tutorial activities directly build toward the assessment - students will practice giving culturally sensitive feedback to teammates and identifying psychological safety barriers.

# Part 1: Cultural Dimensions in Communication

**Understanding the invisible rules that shape how we communicate**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to core content. Frame cultural dimensions not as stereotypes but as useful starting points for understanding communication differences. The goal is cultural intelligence, not cultural assumptions.

Key insight to preview: Culture is relative. What matters is not your absolute position on a dimension, but the distance between you and your communication partner. A Vietnamese manager (PDI=70) and a Danish employee (PDI=18) are 52 points apart - that gap creates communication challenges.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions">

## Hofstede's Six Cultural Dimensions

**Most cited cross-cultural framework in business (33,000+ citations)**

1. **Power Distance (PDI):** Acceptance of unequal power distribution
2. **Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV):** Self-image as "I" vs. "We"
3. **Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS):** Achievement vs. relationship orientation
4. **Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI):** Discomfort with ambiguity
5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (LTO):** Future vs. present focus
6. **Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR):** Gratification vs. control

<speaker-notes>
Foundational framework - this vocabulary appears in every cross-cultural business course globally. Developed by Geert Hofstede from IBM employee surveys across 40 countries (1967-1973), later expanded to 76 countries.

Key teaching point: These are dimensions, not binary categories. Countries score on a 0-100 scale for each dimension. The USA scores 91 on Individualism but only 26 on Long-Term Orientation - every culture has a unique profile.

Students typically ask: "Are these stereotypes?" Answer: No - these are statistical patterns from large-scale research. Individuals vary widely, but the patterns help predict communication norms. Always verify assumptions with actual behavior.

Reference the companion book: Hofstede, G., Hofstede, G. J., & Minkov, M. (2010). <i>Cultures and organizations: Software of the mind</i> (3rd ed.). McGraw-Hill. This is available in the library for students wanting deeper understanding.

<slide number="8" title="Power Distance in Action">

## Power Distance Index (PDI)

**Extent to which less powerful members accept unequal power distribution**

| Low PDI (Egalitarian) | High PDI (Hierarchical) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Denmark (18), Austria (11) | Malaysia (104), Philippines (94) |
| **Vietnam: 70** | United States: 40 |
| Employees expect consultation | Employees expect clear direction |
| Flat organizational structures | Centralized decision-making |
| Calling boss by first name acceptable | Formal titles and hierarchy respected |

**Communication impact:** In high PDI cultures, questioning authority is disrespectful. In low PDI cultures, challenging the boss shows critical thinking.

<speaker-notes>
Critical distinction for Vietnamese students: Vietnam scores 70 on Power Distance, higher than most Western countries (USA=40, UK=35, Australia=36). This affects classroom dynamics too - Vietnamese students may wait for permission to speak, while American professors expect active debate.

Real-world example: A Vietnamese intern at a Danish company was praised for "speaking up" after months of silence. She explained she was waiting to be invited to contribute. The Danish manager never thought to explicitly invite her - he assumed silence meant agreement. This is a classic PDI mismatch.

<b>Centralized</b> (organized around a central authority, concentrated power) decision-making means the manager decides; <b>decentralized</b> (distributed power and decision-making authority) means the team decides. In high PDI cultures, bringing a problem to the boss without a solution is acceptable (you're seeking guidance). In low PDI cultures, it's seen as lazy (you should propose solutions).

Tutorial activity today will have students map their own cultural profile and compare with classmates - they'll discover PDI differences even within Vietnam (North vs. South, urban vs. rural).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Power Distance: Communication Patterns">

## How Power Distance Shapes Communication

**High PDI Communication Patterns (Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines):**
- Information flows top-down through hierarchy
- Decisions made by senior person, communicated to team
- Disagreement expressed privately, indirectly, or not at all
- Formal titles used consistently (Mr., Dr., Manager)
- Junior members wait to be called on before speaking

**Low PDI Communication Patterns (Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands):**
- Information flows freely in all directions
- Decisions made collaboratively with input from all levels
- Disagreement expressed openly in meetings
- First names used regardless of rank
- All members expected to contribute ideas proactively

**Cross-cultural challenge:** Mixed PDI teams must negotiate explicit communication norms or risk misunderstanding silence and initiative.

<speaker-notes>
This slide expands on the PDI dimension with concrete behavioral examples. Students need to see HOW power distance manifests in daily communication, not just abstract scores.

Real-world example of information flow: In a Vietnamese company, a junior employee discovers a major problem. High PDI protocol: tell your direct manager, who tells their manager, who tells the director. The junior employee does NOT email the director directly - that's violating hierarchy. In a Danish company, the junior employee is EXPECTED to email the director directly with urgent problems - going through layers is seen as wasting time.

Decision-making difference: A high PDI manager announces "We will implement Strategy A starting Monday." Team members nod and execute. A low PDI manager says "I'm considering Strategy A. What do you all think?" and expects honest debate. If you transplant the low PDI manager to a high PDI culture, the team will be confused by being asked their opinion (they expect clear direction). If you transplant the high PDI manager to a low PDI culture, the team will resent not being consulted.

Title usage: In Vietnam, using someone's first name without permission shows disrespect, especially with elders or superiors. In Scandinavia, using formal titles feels distant and hierarchical - even the CEO goes by their first name. Vietnamese students working with Danish colleagues may feel uncomfortable using first names initially.

Key teaching point for student teams: If your team has PDI differences, explicitly discuss decision-making process. Will the team leader decide after hearing input? Will you vote? Will you seek consensus? Don't assume everyone shares the same expectation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Individualism vs. Collectivism">

## Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)

**Whether self-image is defined as "I" or "We"**

| High Individualism | Low Individualism (Collectivist) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| USA (91), Australia (90) | Guatemala (6), South Korea (18) |
| Netherlands (80) | **Vietnam: 20** |
| "I" identity - personal achievement | "We" identity - group harmony |
| Direct confrontation acceptable | Indirect conflict avoidance |
| Personal opinion expected | Group consensus valued |

**Communication impact:** Individualists expect personal credit and direct feedback. Collectivists prioritize group face-saving and indirect criticism.

<speaker-notes>
Vietnam scores 20 on Individualism - very collectivist. This explains why Vietnamese students often say "We think..." even when expressing personal opinions, and why direct criticism can damage relationships.

The word "no" is rarely used in collectivist cultures because saying no is confrontational. Hofstede writes: "In most collectivist cultures, direct confrontation of another person is considered rude and undesirable." Students will recognize this from family communication - disagreeing with elders indirectly preserves harmony.

Business application: When giving negative feedback to a collectivist team member, consider doing it privately (preserves face) rather than in a group setting. With individualists, public recognition of personal achievement motivates; with collectivists, recognizing team success motivates.

Common question: "Can individuals be different from their culture's score?" Absolutely - these are statistical patterns, not personality tests. A Vietnamese person raised in Australia may score high on Individualism. Always verify assumptions through observation and conversation.

<b>Face-saving</b> (preserving dignity and reputation in social interactions, avoiding public embarrassment) is critical in collectivist cultures. Loss of face can end business relationships.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Individualism: Conflict and Credit">

## How Individualism Shapes Conflict and Recognition

**Individualist Cultures (USA, Australia, Germany):**
- **Conflict:** "Let's address this issue directly" - confrontation is professional
- **Credit:** "I designed this solution" - claiming personal achievement expected
- **Disagreement:** "I disagree with that approach" - direct opposition acceptable
- **Success metric:** Individual performance reviews, personal bonuses

**Collectivist Cultures (Vietnam, Japan, Thailand):**
- **Conflict:** "Perhaps there's another way to consider this" - indirect suggestion
- **Credit:** "Our team achieved this result" - attributing success to group
- **Disagreement:** Silence or changing subject - preserving harmony
- **Success metric:** Team performance, group recognition

**Cross-cultural challenge:** Individualists may see collectivists as avoiding accountability. Collectivists may see individualists as arrogant and divisive.

<speaker-notes>
This slide provides specific language patterns that students can recognize and adapt. The conflict and credit dimensions are where Individualism vs. Collectivism most clearly affects business communication.

Conflict example: An American team member says "I think this strategy is wrong and here's why..." A Vietnamese team member hearing this may interpret it as aggressive and relationship-damaging. The American expects this to start a productive debate. The Vietnamese colleague may withdraw or agree outwardly while disagreeing internally. Neither person is wrong - they're operating from different cultural scripts.

Credit example: After a successful project, an individualist culture expects each person to articulate their specific contribution. "I led the market research, Sam handled financials, Lee designed the prototype." This shows accountability and helps with performance reviews. In a collectivist culture, this sounds like someone is hogging credit and diminishing others. The expected script: "Our team worked well together and achieved the goal."

The "avoiding accountability" misperception: Western managers often complain that Asian team members won't take personal ownership or admit individual mistakes. From the collectivist perspective, they ARE taking ownership - as a group. Singling out one person for blame (or praise) violates group harmony norms.

The "arrogant" misperception: Asian professionals often find Western colleagues' self-promotion off-putting. "Why do they always talk about themselves?" From the individualist perspective, this is just being clear about contributions - it's factual, not boastful.

Practical tip for mixed teams: Establish explicit norms about credit and conflict. "In our team, it's okay to disagree directly in meetings - we won't take it personally. But we'll attribute project success to the team, not individuals." This hybrid approach respects both cultural styles.

<slide number="12" title="Remaining Four Dimensions">

## Other Cultural Dimensions (Brief Overview)

**3. Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS):**
- High MAS (Japan=95): Achievement, competition, success
- Low MAS (Sweden=5): Cooperation, quality of life, caring
- Vietnam: 40 (moderate)

**4. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI):**
- High UAI (Greece=112): Need for rules and structure
- Low UAI (Singapore=8): Comfortable with ambiguity
- Vietnam: 30 (low - comfortable with flexibility)

**5. Long-Term Orientation (LTO):**
- High LTO (South Korea=100): Future planning, perseverance
- Low LTO (USA=26): Quick results, tradition
- Vietnam: 57 (moderate-high)

**6. Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR):**
- High Indulgence (Mexico=97): Leisure and enjoyment
- High Restraint (Pakistan=0): Strict social norms
- Vietnam: 35 (moderate restraint)

<speaker-notes>
Brief overview - these four dimensions receive less emphasis because Power Distance and Individualism have the strongest impact on business communication. Focus student attention on PDI and IDV for quiz and application.

That said, two dimensions worth highlighting for Vietnamese context:

<b>Uncertainty Avoidance</b> (discomfort with unknown or ambiguous situations, preference for structured environments): Vietnam's low score (30) means Vietnamese culture is relatively comfortable with ambiguity and flexible plans. This contrasts with Germany (65) or France (86), where detailed planning is expected. In practice, Vietnamese startups can pivot quickly, while German companies follow structured processes.

<b>Long-Term Orientation</b> (focus on future rewards vs. immediate results, valuing persistence and adaptation): Vietnam's moderate-high score (57) reflects Confucian values - investing in education for future success, building long-term relationships before business transactions. This aligns well with East Asian business partners (South Korea=100, China=87) but can clash with American quarterly-results focus (USA=26).

Key teaching point: You don't need to memorize all six dimensions for every country. Instead, understand the framework logic and know where to look up scores when working cross-culturally. The Hofstede Insights website (hofstede-insights.com) has a free country comparison tool students can use.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="Culture is Relative">

## Key Insight: Culture is Relative

**What matters is the DISTANCE between cultures, not absolute scores**

**Example:**
- American manager (PDI=40) working with Danish team (PDI=18)
  - Gap: 22 points - minor adjustment needed
- American manager (PDI=40) working with Malaysian team (PDI=104)
  - Gap: 64 points - major communication challenges likely

**Practical application:** Before international collaboration, compare cultural profiles to identify largest gaps. Focus adaptation energy on the biggest differences.

<speaker-notes>
This is the most important slide for practical application. Students often think "I need to learn how to communicate with every culture" - that's overwhelming. Instead, the framework helps you identify where communication friction will occur.

Practical example: A Vietnamese team (PDI=70) collaborating with an American team (PDI=40) faces a 30-point gap on Power Distance. The Vietnamese expect clearer hierarchy and formal communication; Americans expect flatter structure and informal tone. Knowing this gap exists helps both sides adjust expectations.

The larger the gap, the more conscious adaptation required. Small gaps (10-20 points) might go unnoticed. Large gaps (50+ points) require explicit discussion and negotiation of communication norms.

Tool recommendation: Use the Hofstede Insights country comparison tool at hofstede-insights.com. Students can compare Vietnam with any country their team members or business partners come from. The visual comparison chart clearly shows which dimensions have the largest gaps.

Question students typically ask: "What if my team has 4 different countries?" Great question - this is where psychological safety (next section) becomes critical. Diverse teams need explicit norms negotiation and high safety to succeed.

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Cultural Intelligence in Practice">

## Applying Cultural Intelligence (CQ)

**Cultural Intelligence = Knowledge + Mindfulness + Behavioral Adaptation**

**1. Knowledge:** Learn the cultural dimensions (Hofstede) for countries you work with
**2. Mindfulness:** Observe actual behavior, don't assume stereotypes apply
**3. Behavioral Adaptation:** Adjust your communication style based on the gap

**Example in action:**
- **Knowledge:** My Vietnamese colleague comes from high PDI culture (70)
- **Mindfulness:** But I observe she asks questions freely in meetings - lower PDI behavior
- **Adaptation:** I treat her as an individual, not a stereotype. I ask about her preferences directly

**Key principle:** Hofstede provides the starting hypothesis. Real people provide the data. Always verify.

<speaker-notes>
This slide prevents students from misusing Hofstede's framework as rigid stereotypes. Cultural Intelligence (CQ) is the ability to function effectively across cultural contexts - it requires more than just memorizing dimension scores.

The three-step process:
1. **Knowledge:** Use Hofstede as your research tool. Before working with someone from Germany, look up Germany's cultural profile. This gives you educated guesses about potential friction points.

2. **Mindfulness:** Pay attention to actual behavior. Not every German is direct, not every Vietnamese person is collectivist. Within-culture variation is often larger than between-culture variation. Watch, ask questions, test your assumptions.

3. **Behavioral Adaptation:** Once you understand the actual gap between you and your colleague, adjust your style. If they prefer direct feedback, be direct. If they prefer indirect suggestions, be indirect. Adaptation shows respect and effectiveness.

The example demonstrates this process: The speaker uses Hofstede's framework to form an initial hypothesis (Vietnamese = high PDI = waits for permission), but then OBSERVES contradictory evidence (she asks questions freely). The smart move: update your hypothesis based on evidence. This person may have studied abroad, worked in low PDI environments, or simply have a low PDI personality. Treat her as she actually behaves, not as the average Vietnamese person.

<b>Cultural Intelligence</b> (CQ - the capability to function effectively across various cultural contexts, combining knowledge, mindfulness, and behavioral flexibility) is now tested in many graduate programs and international companies. Students can take CQ assessments at culturalq.com.

The "always verify" principle is critical. Students from collectivist cultures sometimes worry that Hofstede's framework reinforces stereotypes about Asians being "passive" or "indirect." Emphasize: These are statistical patterns, not individual predictions. The framework helps you ask better questions, not make assumptions.

Real-world failure example: A manager assumed all his Chinese team members were high Power Distance and never invited their input. One team member quit, saying "I have an MBA from Berkeley - I expected to contribute ideas, not just execute orders." The manager used cultural knowledge to stereotype rather than inform.

# Part 2: Psychological Safety in Teams

**Creating environments where people can take interpersonal risks**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to second framework. Psychological safety is the bridge between cultural awareness (Part 1) and effective team communication. Even teams with cultural alignment fail without psychological safety.

Preview the key finding: Google's Project Aristotle studied 180 teams over 2 years to identify what makes teams effective. The #1 predictor wasn't talent, resources, or leadership - it was psychological safety. Teams where members felt safe to take risks outperformed teams with better credentials but lower safety.

This framework was developed by Amy Edmondson at Harvard Business School and has been cited over 92,000 times. It's now considered foundational knowledge for anyone managing or working in teams.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="framework" title="Psychological Safety Definition">

## What is Psychological Safety?

**"A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking"**
*(Edmondson, 1999)*

**What psychological safety IS:**
- Confidence that speaking up won't be punished
- Willingness to admit mistakes without shame
- Freedom to ask questions without looking ignorant
- Trust that others won't undermine your efforts

**What psychological safety IS NOT:**
- Being nice or avoiding difficult conversations
- Lowering performance standards
- Protecting people from consequences
- Group cohesiveness (cohesive groups can be psychologically unsafe)

<speaker-notes>
Critical distinction - students often confuse psychological safety with "being comfortable" or "everyone gets along." Edmondson explicitly distinguishes psychological safety from trust, cohesiveness, and "niceness."

<b>Trust</b> (expectation that others will act reliably and with good intent) is about predicting others' future actions ("I trust you'll meet the deadline"). <b>Psychological safety</b> (confidence that taking interpersonal risks won't lead to punishment or embarrassment) is about the team climate ("I feel safe admitting I don't understand").

The "being nice" misconception is especially important to address. Psychologically safe teams have MORE difficult conversations, not fewer. The difference is that challenges are received as contributions, not attacks. Example: In an unsafe team, saying "I think this strategy is flawed" gets you labeled as negative or disloyal. In a safe team, it starts a productive debate.

Real-world example: Pixar's "Braintrust" meetings are famous for brutal honesty about film projects. Directors show unfinished work and receive frank criticism. This works because safety is high - everyone knows the feedback aims to improve the film, not attack the director. Result: Pixar's success rate is unmatched in the industry.

Question students typically ask: "How do you measure psychological safety?" Edmondson created a 7-item survey (next slide shows the items). Teams answer on a 1-7 scale. Scores below 4.5 indicate low safety; above 5.5 indicate high safety.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="Measuring Psychological Safety">

## Edmondson's 7-Item Psychological Safety Index

Rate your team (1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree):

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you *(reverse scored)*
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different *(reverse scored)*
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help *(reverse scored)*
6. No one on this team would deliberately act to undermine my efforts
7. Working with this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized

**Scoring:** Reverse items 1, 3, 5, then average all seven. Score >5.5 = high safety; <4.5 = low safety.

<speaker-notes>
This is a validated research instrument students can actually use with their group presentation teams. Tutorial activity today includes a mini psychological safety assessment.

Walk through the logic of <b>reverse scoring</b> (flipping the numerical value so higher scores consistently indicate better outcomes): Items 1, 3, and 5 are phrased negatively, so "strongly disagree" (1) actually indicates HIGH safety. To reverse score, subtract from 8: a "1" becomes a "7", a "2" becomes a "6", etc. This ensures all items point in the same direction before averaging.

Practical interpretation:
- **Item 2 and 4:** Core safety - can people speak up and take risks?
- **Item 5 and 6:** Interpersonal trust - can people ask for help without judgment?
- **Item 7:** Inclusion - are different perspectives valued?

If a team scores low on items 2 and 4 but high on items 5-7, the issue is likely a dominant member or leader who punishes dissent. If low on item 7 specifically, the team may have an inclusion problem - certain members' contributions are dismissed.

Cultural connection: High Power Distance teams may naturally score lower on item 2 ("bring up problems") and item 4 ("safe to take a risk") because hierarchy discourages challenging authority. This doesn't mean the team is dysfunctional - it means cultural norms shape what "safety" looks like. The key is whether ALL team members feel they can contribute, regardless of rank.

<b>Validated</b> (tested through research to ensure the measure actually captures what it claims to measure, proven reliable across contexts) means this isn't just Edmondson's opinion - the scale has been tested across industries, cultures, and team types with consistent results.

<slide number="18" title="The Four Zones Framework">

## Psychological Safety × Accountability Matrix

| | **Low Accountability** | **High Accountability** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Psychological Safety** | **Comfort Zone**<br>Safe but complacent<br>Low motivation<br>Minimal innovation | **Learning Zone**<br>**OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE**<br>High engagement<br>Continuous improvement |
| **Low Psychological Safety** | **Apathy Zone**<br>Minimal effort<br>High turnover<br>Disengagement | **Anxiety Zone**<br>Fear-driven work<br>Burnout risk<br>Covering mistakes |

**Goal:** High Safety + High Accountability = Learning Zone

<speaker-notes>
This matrix is essential for understanding that psychological safety alone is insufficient - teams need BOTH safety and accountability to thrive.

Walk through each quadrant with examples:

**Apathy Zone** (Low Safety, Low Accountability): Government bureaucracies with no consequences for failure and no voice for improvement. People show up, do minimum work, leave. High turnover among ambitious employees.

**Anxiety Zone** (Low Safety, High Accountability): Investment banking or management consulting during crisis periods. Extremely high performance pressure combined with fear of mistakes. Result: people work 80-hour weeks, hide problems until too late, burn out. Short-term results may be good, but long-term sustainability is terrible.

**Comfort Zone** (High Safety, Low Accountability): Family businesses with no performance management. Everyone feels supported and liked, but no one pushes for excellence. Comfortable but ultimately vulnerable to competitive pressure.

**Learning Zone** (High Safety, High Accountability): High-performing tech companies like Google, Pixar, or innovative startups. Teams set ambitious goals AND create safety to experiment, fail, and learn. This is where breakthrough innovation happens.

Key teaching point: Many managers think accountability and safety are opposite ends of a spectrum - either you're demanding OR you're supportive. The matrix shows they're independent dimensions. Great leaders maximize BOTH.

Cultural consideration: High Power Distance cultures may interpret high accountability as micromanagement if it's not combined with explicit safety signals. In Vietnam, a manager who sets high standards should also explicitly state: "I want to hear about problems early" and "Mistakes are learning opportunities."

Question to pose: "Which zone does your current team operate in?" Have students reflect on their group presentation teams. Most undergraduate teams default to Comfort Zone (friends working together, low pressure). Encourage them to move toward Learning Zone.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="19" title="Building Psychological Safety">

## Three Leadership Behaviors to Build Psychological Safety

**1. Set the Stage:**
- Frame work as a learning problem, not execution problem
- Acknowledge your own fallibility: "I don't have all the answers"
- Emphasize the need for everyone's voice

**2. Invite Participation:**
- Proactive inquiry: Ask "What are we missing?"
- Create structures for input (anonymous surveys, round-robin sharing)
- Model good listening without defensiveness

**3. Respond Productively:**
- Express appreciation for contributions ("Thank you for raising that")
- Destigmatize failure ("What did we learn from this?")
- Offer help and resources to solve problems

<speaker-notes>
These are actionable behaviors students can apply immediately in their group presentation teams. Emphasize that psychological safety is built through consistent behaviors, not one-time speeches.

**Set the Stage** example: At the first group meeting, a team leader could say: "This presentation is complex and none of us have all the expertise. I expect we'll all make mistakes as we figure this out. The goal is learning together, not having perfect ideas from day one."

This is <b>framing</b> (describing a situation in a way that shapes how people think about it, setting the context for interpretation). Framing work as "learning" vs. "execution" changes how people react to problems. Execution framing: problems = failure. Learning framing: problems = data.

**Invite Participation** example: Instead of "Does anyone have questions?" (which often gets silence), ask "What's one thing that's unclear to you?" The second question assumes everyone has something unclear, removing the stigma of not knowing.

Round-robin sharing: Go around the table so everyone speaks once before anyone speaks twice. This prevents dominant members from controlling conversation and signals that all voices matter.

**Respond Productively** example: When someone admits a mistake, the leader says "I appreciate you bringing this up early - that gives us time to fix it" rather than "Why did this happen?" The first response rewards transparency; the second punishes it.

<b>Destigmatize</b> (remove the shame or negative judgment associated with something, normalize what was previously considered unacceptable) failure by treating it as information, not character flaw. NASA now requires "pre-mortems" - teams imagine the project failed and work backward to identify risks. This surfaces concerns BEFORE they become disasters.

Cultural adaptation: In high Power Distance cultures, #1 (leader admitting fallibility) may reduce respect if done incorrectly. Better phrasing: "This is a complex challenge that requires all our expertise" rather than "I don't know what I'm doing." Acknowledge uncertainty in the TASK, not incompetence in the LEADER.

Tutorial today: Students will practice #2 (Invite Participation) by using structured feedback protocols that ensure everyone contributes.

<slide number="20" title="Psychological Safety Across Cultures">

## How Culture Shapes Psychological Safety

**High Power Distance + Collectivism (Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia):**
- Safety requires explicit permission from authority to speak
- Mistakes are private matters, not public learning moments
- Younger/junior members need active invitation to contribute
- Challenging ideas may feel like challenging people

**Low Power Distance + Individualism (USA, Netherlands, Australia):**
- Safety means freedom to speak without invitation
- Mistakes are shared openly as team learning opportunities
- All members expected to contribute proactively
- Challenging ideas is separate from challenging people

**Implication:** Teams with cultural diversity must explicitly define what "safe" means for their context.

<speaker-notes>
This slide connects psychological safety back to Hofstede's dimensions, showing how culture shapes what safety looks like in practice.

The key insight: Edmondson's framework is valid across cultures, but the BEHAVIORS that create safety differ by cultural context.

In high PDI + collectivist cultures (Vietnam), a leader builds safety by:
- Explicitly inviting junior members to speak: "Minh, I'd like to hear your perspective on this"
- Framing mistakes as team issues, not individual failures: "Our process needs improvement" not "You made a mistake"
- Allowing private channels for concerns (one-on-one meetings, anonymous surveys)
- Separating the idea from the person when giving feedback: "This approach has some challenges" not "You're wrong"

In low PDI + individualist cultures (USA), a leader builds safety by:
- Remaining silent to create space for others to speak first
- Publicly acknowledging their own mistakes to model vulnerability
- Expecting people to voice concerns without invitation
- Distinguishing task conflict from relationship conflict explicitly

Common failure in multicultural teams: An American leader says "I want everyone to challenge my ideas - don't hold back." Vietnamese team members hear this but don't believe it, because in their experience, challenging authority has negative consequences. The leader needs to PROVE safety through actions, not just words.

Proof of safety: When a Vietnamese team member tentatively questions an idea, the American leader must respond with genuine appreciation and openness. If the leader gets defensive or dismissive, safety collapses. One negative response undoes ten safety-building statements.

Practical strategy for mixed teams: Use structured turn-taking to ensure everyone speaks. In high PDI cultures, junior members may never volunteer to speak if senior members are talking freely. Round-robin forces inclusion.

Tutorial application: Students will practice building safety across cultural differences by role-playing team scenarios with different Power Distance and Individualism profiles.

# Part 3: Cross-Cultural Feedback

**Adapting your message to your audience's cultural context**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to third framework. Now that students understand cultural dimensions (Part 1) and psychological safety (Part 2), we can apply these concepts to the specific skill of giving feedback across cultures.

Preview the challenge: Feedback is difficult even within the same culture. Add cultural differences in directness, power distance, and face-saving, and feedback becomes a minefield. The good news: Erin Meyer's research provides a practical framework.

Meyer is a professor at INSEAD (one of the top business schools globally) and author of <i>The Culture Map</i>. Her 2023 Harvard Business Review article "When Diversity Meets Feedback" is specifically written for practitioners, not academics - very applicable to student team situations.

<slide number="22" layout="framework" title="The Three A's of Feedback">

## Meyer's Three A's Framework for Cross-Cultural Feedback

**1. Aim to Assist:**
- Give feedback ONLY with genuine intention to help
- Never to vent frustration or assert dominance
- Ask: "Will this feedback help them improve?"

**2. Actionable:**
- Include clear actions the recipient can take
- If no action is possible, withhold the feedback
- Vague feedback ("be more professional") doesn't help

**3. Ask First:**
- Request feedback on your own work before giving to others
- Balances power dynamics and models openness
- Especially important across status differences

**Application:** Use all three A's to avoid feedback backfiring

<speaker-notes>
The Three A's are deceptively simple but profoundly effective. Walk through each with examples:

**Aim to Assist** - negative example: A teammate says "Your slide design is terrible." Intent: vent frustration. Result: defensive reaction, damaged relationship. Positive example: "I noticed the text is hard to read on these slides. Would it help if I shared some design templates?" Intent: help them improve. Result: gratitude, better slides.

The question "Will this feedback help them improve?" is a litmus test. If the answer is no (the mistake is already made and can't be fixed, or the person can't control the issue), stay silent. Feedback that doesn't enable improvement is just criticism.

**Actionable** - Meyer's research found that the #1 cause of feedback resentment is vague comments like "be more strategic" or "show more leadership." These don't tell the person WHAT to do differently. Actionable version: "In next week's presentation, start with the recommendation rather than background. That's what executives expect."

<b>Vague</b> (unclear or imprecise, lacking specific details or concrete guidance) feedback wastes everyone's time. The recipient doesn't know how to improve, and the giver gets frustrated when nothing changes.

**Ask First** - This is brilliant for cross-cultural contexts. Example: Before giving feedback to a senior teammate in a high Power Distance culture, say "I'd love your feedback on my section first." This accomplishes two things: (1) It demonstrates humility and respect for hierarchy, and (2) It models openness to feedback, making it safer for them to receive your feedback later.

Meyer's research found that women receive 5× more unsolicited feedback than men, and that unsolicited feedback is often resented regardless of culture. "Ask First" prevents this by turning feedback into a mutual exchange rather than a one-way critique.

Case study on next slide illustrates Ask First in action.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Case Study: Unsolicited Feedback">

## Case Study: Cassandra and Miles

**Situation:**
Cassandra (software VP) delivers a presentation at a company meeting. Afterward, her colleague Miles sends a detailed email with "tips for improving" her delivery, slide design, and content.

**The problem:**
- Cassandra found the feedback "hijacked her self-confidence"
- She didn't ask for Miles's opinion
- The power imbalance (unrequested advice) felt condescending
- Meyer's research: 90%+ of women report receiving unrequested feedback from male colleagues

**What went wrong:**
Miles violated "Ask First" - he gave feedback without being invited. Even if his tips were useful, the unsolicited nature created resentment.

**Better approach:**
Miles: "I thought your presentation was strong. If you're interested, I have a couple thoughts on slide design from my experience. Would you like to hear them?"
Cassandra now has the power to accept or decline.

<speaker-notes>
This case study resonates with students, especially female students who've experienced this dynamic. The key insight: even well-intentioned feedback can damage relationships if it violates cultural or gender norms.

Meyer's research is sobering: Over 90% of women report receiving unsolicited professional advice from male colleagues, while men rarely receive unrequested feedback from women. This creates a <b>power imbalance</b> (unequal distribution of influence or authority in a relationship or interaction) where women's competence is constantly questioned.

The solution isn't "never give feedback to women" - that would be patronizing and prevent their development. The solution is Ask First, REGARDLESS of the recipient's gender or status. Make feedback a collaborative exchange, not a top-down judgment.

Cultural dimension connection: Ask First is ESPECIALLY important in high Power Distance cultures (like Vietnam) where unsolicited advice from a junior to senior person is disrespectful. Even if you're right, you'll be dismissed for violating hierarchy norms.

Flip the scenario: If Cassandra had asked Miles for feedback ("I'd love your thoughts on my presentation"), the same advice would likely be received with gratitude. The act of asking shifts the power dynamic.

Discussion question: "Have you ever received feedback that made you defensive, even though the content was true?" Most students will raise hands. Follow-up: "Was it the WHAT or the HOW that bothered you?" Usually it's the how - the violation of Ask First, the public setting, the condescending tone.

Tutorial today: Students will practice Ask First by exchanging feedback requests in pairs before giving feedback to each other.

<slide number="24" title="Upgraders and Downgraders">

## Upgraders vs. Downgraders in Feedback

**Direct Cultures (use UPGRADERS):**
- Germany, Netherlands, Russia, Israel
- Language: "absolutely," "totally," "completely"
- Feedback: "This is completely wrong and needs to be redone"
- Rationale: Clarity prevents misunderstanding

**Indirect Cultures (use DOWNGRADERS):**
- Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam
- Language: "kind of," "a little," "maybe," "perhaps"
- Feedback: "Maybe we could consider adjusting this slightly"
- Rationale: Preserves relationship and face

**Counterintuitive finding:**
Americans are LOW-context (direct communication) but INDIRECT with negative feedback
French are HIGH-context (indirect communication) but DIRECT with criticism

<speaker-notes>
This slide often surprises students because it challenges their assumptions about direct vs. indirect communication. The key insight: Communication style and feedback style are DIFFERENT dimensions.

<b>Low-context</b> (communication where meaning is explicitly stated in words, not implied by context or nonverbal cues) cultures like the USA spell everything out clearly. Americans say exactly what they mean in normal conversation. But when giving NEGATIVE feedback, Americans soften it with phrases like "This is good, but maybe we could..." The praise is fake; the "but" signals the real message.

<b>High-context</b> (communication where meaning is implied through context, relationships, and nonverbal cues rather than explicitly stated in words) cultures like France rely on shared understanding and reading between the lines. But when giving criticism, French professionals are blunt: "This is not acceptable." They assume you're mature enough to handle directness.

Vietnam is similar to Thailand in Meyer's model - indirect feedback culture. Vietnamese professionals say "maybe we could try a different approach" rather than "this approach is wrong." The recipient is expected to understand that "maybe" means "definitely yes."

Cross-cultural failure example: An American manager in Thailand said "There are a few areas where you could improve" (he thought he was being polite). The Thai employee heard "a few areas" and thought "mostly good, minor tweaks needed." The manager expected major changes. Result: frustration on both sides.

Case study on next slide shows this in action.

Germany and Netherlands are famous for direct feedback - they see softening as dishonest and inefficient. A Dutch colleague might say "Your analysis is completely wrong" and consider that helpful and professional. An American would be offended by the "completely." But a German would be MORE offended if you sugarcoated feedback - they'd think you're wasting time or being manipulative.

Cultural adaptation: When giving feedback across cultures, MATCH THE RECIPIENT'S STYLE. Giving upgrader feedback to a downgrader culture will damage the relationship. Giving downgrader feedback to an upgrader culture will be misunderstood as "everything is fine."

How do you know which style to use? Ask or observe. If your Vietnamese teammate uses a lot of "maybe" and "perhaps," match that style. If your German teammate is direct, be direct back.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Case Study: Direct Feedback Clash">

## Case Study: Jethro in Thailand

**Situation:**
Jethro (American VP) gives performance feedback to Thai employee via video call: "Your presentation skills need improvement. You need to make more eye contact and speak more confidently."

**The result:**
Thai HR team accuses Jethro of "bullying." The employee felt personally attacked and humiliated.

**What went wrong:**
- American direct style ("needs improvement") perceived as harsh in Thai indirect culture
- Explicit criticism (even mild by US standards) violates Thai face-saving norms
- Video call made it feel public, increasing embarrassment

**Cultural adaptation:**
Thai indirect approach: "Your presentation was good. Perhaps if you made a bit more eye contact, it could be even stronger." (Praise what's good, gently suggest what could be better)

<speaker-notes>
This case study illustrates how the SAME WORDS can have completely different impacts across cultures. Jethro thought he was being helpful and professional - he explicitly identified areas for growth. In the US, this is standard performance feedback. In Thailand, it's an insult.

The Thai principle: "Praise what's good, leave out what's bad." If you can't say something positive, say nothing. Negative feedback is given only in extreme situations, privately, and with extensive softening.

Thailand's cultural profile explains this: High Power Distance (64) + High Collectivism (20 Individualism) + High face-saving culture = extreme indirectness with criticism. The employee's "face" (social dignity and reputation) is damaged by explicit criticism, especially from a senior person.

<b>Face-saving</b> (preserving one's dignity, reputation, and social standing in interactions to maintain respect and relationships) is critical in collectivist Asian cultures. Loss of face can end careers and relationships. Western cultures focus on "saving time" and "getting to the point"; Asian cultures prioritize "saving face" and "preserving relationships."

The video call detail matters: In Thai culture, a private in-person conversation would be slightly less damaging than a video call, which could be recorded or overheard. The more public the feedback, the more face is lost.

Jethro's adaptation: He learned to restructure feedback as questions: "What could make your presentation even stronger?" This allows the Thai employee to self-identify improvements without being explicitly criticized. It's indirect but effective.

Vietnam comparison: Vietnam is similar to Thailand in feedback indirectness (both are high Collectivism, high Power Distance). Vietnamese students will recognize this dynamic - direct criticism from a teacher or boss feels harsh, while suggestions phrased as "perhaps you could try..." feel supportive.

Discussion question: "How do you prefer to receive feedback - direct or indirect?" Students will be split. Then ask: "Has anyone ever given you feedback that was too harsh or too soft for your preference?" This makes the cultural dimension personal and relatable.

Practical tip for group presentations: At your first team meeting, explicitly discuss feedback preferences. Ask: "Do you prefer direct feedback or softened feedback?" This prevents the Thai-American collision from happening in your team.

<slide number="26" title="The Feedback Equation">

## Combining the Three A's with Upgraders/Downgraders

**Effective cross-cultural feedback formula:**

1. **Ask First** → Establish permission and mutual exchange
2. **Assess culture** → Determine if recipient expects upgraders or downgraders
3. **Aim to Assist** → Ensure genuine helpful intent
4. **Make it Actionable** → Provide specific, doable next steps
5. **Match directness level** → Use upgraders for direct cultures, downgraders for indirect

**Example - Feedback to Vietnamese teammate:**
❌ **Wrong:** "Your analysis is completely off-base. You need to redo this."
✓ **Right:** "I'd love your feedback on my section first. [After receiving] Thanks! On your analysis, I wonder if we could perhaps consider including customer data to strengthen the argument? Would that be helpful?"

<speaker-notes>
This slide synthesizes Meyer's Three A's with the upgrader/downgrader distinction, giving students a complete step-by-step process for cross-cultural feedback.

Walk through the Vietnamese example in detail:

**What's wrong with the wrong version:**
- Violates Ask First (unsolicited feedback)
- Uses upgraders ("completely") in a downgrader culture
- Not actionable ("off-base" is vague - what specifically is wrong?)
- Doesn't Aim to Assist (sounds like criticism, not help)

**What's right about the right version:**
- Starts with Ask First (requesting feedback first establishes mutual exchange)
- Uses downgraders ("perhaps," "wonder if we could") appropriate for Vietnamese indirect culture
- Actionable ("include customer data" - specific action)
- Aims to Assist (ends with "Would that be helpful?" - clarifies helpful intent)

The phrasing "I wonder if we could..." is particularly effective in collectivist cultures because:
1. It's collaborative ("we") not individualistic ("you should")
2. It's exploratory ("wonder if") not dictatorial ("you must")
3. It preserves face (implying the problem is minor and easily fixed)

Key teaching point: This formula feels unnatural if you're from a direct culture. German or Dutch students may feel like they're being manipulative or dishonest with all the softening language. Vietnamese students may feel like they're being too aggressive if they try upgrader feedback with German teammates. Both reactions are normal - cultural adaptation requires stepping outside your comfort zone.

The goal isn't to eliminate your natural style - it's to CODE-SWITCH (adjust your communication style based on context and audience while maintaining authenticity) when working across cultures. With same-culture colleagues, use your natural style. With cross-cultural colleagues, adapt deliberately.

Practice opportunity: Tutorial today has students practice this formula with role-play scenarios. Each student gives feedback to partners from different cultural backgrounds (simulated through role cards), applying the appropriate directness level.

Common student question: "What if I don't know the person's culture?" Valid concern. Solution: Default to Ask First and moderate directness (not completely upgraders, not completely downgraders). Then PAY ATTENTION to how they respond. If they seem confused or hurt by your feedback style, adjust. Communication is iterative - you learn by doing and observing reactions.

# Part 4: Global Virtual Team Dynamics

**What research tells us about distributed collaboration**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to final framework. We've covered culture (Part 1), team safety (Part 2), and feedback (Part 3). Now we apply these concepts to the context most students will face: working in virtual teams across borders and time zones.

This section is based on the largest empirical study of global virtual teams: 5,728 individuals in 804 teams across 90 countries (Taras et al., 2021). The findings challenge common assumptions about diversity.

Preview the key insight: Not all diversity is created equal. Personal diversity (age, gender, race) creates different challenges than contextual diversity (country, function, industry). Understanding this distinction helps teams leverage diversity as strength rather than fighting it as weakness.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="framework" title="Personal vs Contextual Diversity">

## Personal vs. Contextual Diversity Framework

| Type | Definition | Examples | Primary Impact |
|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Personal** | Individual demographic characteristics | Age, gender, race, ethnicity | **Psychological outcomes** - Satisfaction, cohesion, turnover |
| **Contextual** | Background and experience | Country, industry, function, education | **Task outcomes** - Quality, creativity, innovation |

**Key Finding:**
Teams with higher contextual diversity produced higher-quality work and more creative solutions. The benefits of diverse backgrounds outweighed the psychological challenges.

**Implication:**
Don't avoid diversity - manage the people-side challenges while leveraging the task-side benefits.

<speaker-notes>
This framework is a game-changer for how students think about team composition. The common fear: "Diverse teams are harder to work with, so let's form homogeneous teams." The research says: "Diverse teams ARE harder to coordinate, but they produce BETTER work if you manage the relationship challenges."

Break down each type:

**Personal diversity** creates <b>psychological</b> (relating to the mind, emotions, and interpersonal dynamics rather than task performance) challenges because humans have unconscious biases and in-group preferences. A team with 3 men and 1 woman may unconsciously exclude the woman from informal bonding. A team with members aged 22, 24, 25, and 45 may struggle with generational communication differences (the 45-year-old may prefer email; the 22-year-olds prefer Slack).

These challenges are REAL and shouldn't be dismissed. The research shows personal diversity DOES reduce satisfaction and cohesion if not actively managed. The solution isn't to avoid personal diversity - it's to build psychological safety and explicit inclusion practices.

**Contextual diversity** drives better TASK outcomes because different backgrounds bring different perspectives, networks, and problem-solving approaches. A team with members from Vietnam, Germany, and Brazil will generate more diverse solutions to a business problem than three Vietnamese members. A team with members from marketing, engineering, and finance will spot issues others miss.

Taras et al.'s research (5,728 participants) found that teams with higher contextual diversity produced higher-rated consulting reports and more innovative recommendations. The quality difference was measurable and significant.

The implication for student teams: Your group presentation benefits from contextual diversity. If all four members are business majors from Ho Chi Minh City, you'll coordinate easily but may produce generic ideas. If you have a business major, an engineering major, someone from Hanoi, and someone who's lived abroad, coordination is harder BUT the final presentation will be richer.

Practical advice: Deliberately form teams with contextual diversity (different majors, different cities, different work experiences). Then invest in building psychological safety to manage the personal diversity challenges.

<b>Homogeneous</b> (composed of similar elements, uniform in character and background) teams coordinate easily but think similarly. <b>Heterogeneous</b> (composed of diverse elements, varied in character and background) teams struggle to coordinate but think differently.

Question to pose: "Is your current group presentation team high or low in contextual diversity?" Have students assess: Do we all have the same major? Same work experience? Same cultural background? If yes to all three, encourage them to seek diverse perspectives through interviews or readings.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="29" title="Cultural Dimensions That Matter Most">

## Which Cultural Dimensions Most Impact Virtual Team Performance?

**Taras et al. (2021) findings from 804 global virtual teams:**

**Most Important Positive Factors:**
1. **Gender Egalitarianism:** Cultures that value equal rights and opportunities for all genders produce more effective virtual teams
2. **Low Power Distance:** Flat hierarchies enable better virtual collaboration than strict hierarchies

**Why these matter:**
- Virtual communication removes visual status cues (office size, clothing, body language)
- Text-based communication (email, Slack) is inherently egalitarian
- High Power Distance cultures struggle when hierarchy is invisible in virtual contexts

**Implication:**
Virtual teams should explicitly negotiate communication norms, especially around hierarchy and participation equality.

<speaker-notes>
This slide connects back to Hofstede's framework (Part 1) but shows which dimensions matter MOST for virtual teams specifically.

**Gender Egalitarianism** - cultures where women and men have equal voice and authority in business create better virtual teams. Why? Virtual collaboration requires EVERYONE'S input, regardless of gender. Teams from cultures with low gender egalitarianism (where men dominate meetings) lose 50% of their talent pool.

Research finding: Teams with at least 30% women consistently outperform all-male teams in collaborative problem-solving. But this benefit only appears if the culture actually LISTENS to women's contributions. In low gender egalitarianism cultures, women may be present but silenced.

Vietnam context: Vietnam has relatively high gender egalitarianism compared to other Asian countries (women have high labor force participation and property rights). But informal bias still exists - in mixed-gender teams, male voices may dominate. Virtual work can actually help level this by removing physical presence bias.

**Low Power Distance** advantage in virtual teams - when everyone communicates via email or Slack, there are fewer visible status cues. No corner office, no expensive suit, no sitting at the head of the table. This naturally flattens hierarchy.

But high Power Distance cultures may feel disoriented in virtual contexts. A Vietnamese team member may not know whether it's acceptable to message the senior member directly on Slack, or whether they should go through a manager. These norms need to be made explicit.

Practical application for student teams: At your first virtual meeting, explicitly discuss:
1. "Can anyone message anyone directly, or do we use hierarchy?" (Power Distance norms)
2. "Do we expect everyone to contribute equally in discussions?" (Gender egalitarianism norms)
3. "How do we make decisions - voting, consensus, or leader decides?" (Decision-making norms)

Making implicit norms explicit prevents confusion and frustration.

<b>Egalitarian</b> (believing in equal rights and opportunities for all people regardless of rank or status) is different from <b>egalitarianism</b> (principle or practice of treating all people as equals in social, political, and professional contexts). Gender egalitarianism specifically means equal voice and authority for all genders in social and professional contexts.

Counterintuitive finding: High Power Distance teams can work well face-to-face (status cues are clear), but struggle virtually (status cues disappear). Low Power Distance teams have an easier time adapting to virtual work because they already expect equal participation.

Link to psychological safety: Low Power Distance + Gender Egalitarianism = structural conditions that enable psychological safety. If everyone's voice is valued regardless of rank or gender, people feel safer speaking up.

<slide number="30" title="Managing Global Virtual Teams">

## Practical Strategies for Global Virtual Teams

**From Taras et al. (2021) research:**

**1. Leverage Contextual Diversity:**
- Assign tasks that benefit from different perspectives
- Actively seek input from members with different functional backgrounds
- Value country-specific knowledge as expertise

**2. Proactively Manage Personal Diversity:**
- Build informal connection time (not just task focus)
- Rotate meeting times to share time zone burden
- Establish explicit communication norms in writing

**3. Create Positive Team Climate:**
- Psychological safety practices from Edmondson
- Cross-cultural feedback using Meyer's Three A's
- Regular check-ins on team dynamics, not just task progress

<speaker-notes>
This slide provides actionable takeaways students can apply to their group presentation teams.

**#1 Leverage Contextual Diversity** - specific tactics:

"Assign tasks that benefit from different perspectives" - Example: If designing a marketing campaign, have the engineering major critique technical feasibility, the business major assess market fit, and the design major evaluate visual appeal. Each brings unique lens.

"Actively seek input" - Don't wait for diverse voices to speak up (they may not in high Power Distance cultures). Directly ask: "Minh, you worked in customer service - what's your take on this?" "Linh, you're from Hanoi - would this approach work there?"

"Value country-specific knowledge as expertise" - When a Vietnamese team member explains local business customs, treat it as valuable data, not just opinion. In multicultural teams, cultural knowledge IS expertise.

**#2 Proactively Manage Personal Diversity** - specific tactics:

"Build informal connection time" - Start meetings with 5 minutes of personal check-in before diving into work. This builds relationships that buffer against task conflict later. Ask: "What's one good thing that happened this week?"

"Rotate meeting times" - If your team has members in different time zones, don't always meet at 9 PM for the Australian member. Rotate so everyone shares the inconvenience. This signals fairness and respect.

<b>Rotate</b> (take turns in a sequence or cycle, alternating responsibility or burden among team members) means alternating who bears the burden. Week 1 at 9 PM Vietnam time (morning in Australia), Week 2 at 6 AM Vietnam time (evening in Australia), etc.

"Establish explicit norms in writing" - Don't assume everyone shares the same expectations about response time, meeting attendance, or work quality. Write down: "We respond to messages within 24 hours," "We all review materials before meetings," "We give each other direct feedback privately."

**#3 Create Positive Team Climate** - this synthesizes all frameworks:

Edmondson's psychological safety practices (Set the Stage, Invite Participation, Respond Productively) work in virtual teams if you're intentional. Example: In a Zoom call, use the "raise hand" feature to ensure everyone speaks before anyone speaks twice (Invite Participation).

Meyer's Three A's prevent feedback disasters in multicultural teams. Before giving critical feedback to a teammate from a different culture, verify you're following Aim to Assist (helping, not venting), Actionable (they can fix it), and Ask First (they requested it).

"Regular check-ins on team dynamics" - Don't wait until frustration explodes. After week 1 of the group project, ask: "How is everyone feeling about our team process? What's working? What could be better?" Intervene early on relationship issues.

Cultural consideration: Vietnamese students may hesitate to voice concerns in team check-ins (collectivist norm to preserve harmony). Use anonymous surveys or private one-on-one check-ins to surface issues.

Example check-in question: Use Edmondson's psychological safety scale (Slide 17) as a team health check. Have everyone rate the team on the 7 items, average the scores, and discuss where safety is low.

Practical homework for student teams: At your next group meeting, spend 15 minutes establishing explicit norms using the questions on this slide. Write them down in your shared Google Doc. Refer back when conflicts arise.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="31" title="Virtual Team Success Factors">

## Research-Validated Success Factors for Virtual Teams

**Taras et al. (2021) identified these factors correlate with higher performance:**

**Communication practices:**
- Regular synchronous meetings (video > audio > text)
- Established response time expectations
- Multiple communication channels for different purposes
- Explicit norms about when to use which channel

**Relationship building:**
- Initial face-to-face meeting if possible (or extended video kickoff)
- Informal social time built into meetings
- Celebration of milestones and wins
- Recognition of individual contributions

**Conflict management:**
- Early intervention when tensions emerge
- Distinguish task conflict (healthy) from relationship conflict (destructive)
- Use structured processes for difficult conversations
- Leverage cultural differences as asset, not obstacle

<speaker-notes>
This slide provides research-backed best practices specific to virtual team success. These aren't just opinions - they're factors that Taras et al. found consistently separated high-performing from low-performing virtual teams.

**Communication practices** - the research is clear:

"Regular synchronous meetings" - Teams that meet regularly in real-time (video calls) outperform teams that rely only on async communication (email, Slack). Why? Synchronous builds relationships and prevents misunderstandings from escalating. Recommended frequency: at least once per week for active projects.

Video > audio > text: The richer the communication medium, the better for building trust and psychological safety. Video lets you see facial expressions and body language. Audio gives you tone. Text removes all nonverbal cues and increases misinterpretation risk.

"Established response time expectations" - unclear expectations are a major source of virtual team conflict. One person thinks "urgent" means respond in 1 hour; another thinks it means 1 day. Explicit norm prevents frustration: "We respond to Slack messages within 4 hours during business hours, email within 24 hours."

"Multiple channels for different purposes" - high-performing teams use different tools strategically. Example: Slack for quick questions, email for decisions that need documentation, video calls for complex discussions, shared docs for collaborative work. Low-performing teams use everything for everything, creating noise and confusion.

**Relationship building** - this addresses personal diversity challenges:

"Initial face-to-face meeting if possible" - Research shows that even ONE in-person meeting at project start significantly improves virtual team performance over the full project duration. If in-person isn't possible, spend extra time on the first video call (2-3 hours) building relationships before diving into tasks.

Why does this work? Face-to-face builds trust reservoir that carries through virtual work. When conflicts arise later, team members give each other benefit of doubt because they've met in person.

"Informal social time" - Don't make every interaction task-focused. High-performing virtual teams deliberately create space for personal connection - 5 minutes of small talk before meetings, optional virtual coffee chats, sharing non-work updates in Slack. This prevents relationships from becoming purely transactional.

"Celebration of milestones" - Virtual teams can feel like endless work with no acknowledgment. Celebrate completing major deliverables, reaching project phases, individual birthdays or achievements. This builds team identity and morale.

**Conflict management** - critical for diverse teams:

"Early intervention" - Don't let tensions simmer. Virtual conflict escalates faster than face-to-face conflict because text communication lacks nuance. If you sense frustration (short emails, reduced participation), address it immediately with a video call.

"Distinguish task conflict from relationship conflict" - Task conflict (disagreeing about the best approach) is HEALTHY and improves decisions. Relationship conflict (personal animosity) is DESTRUCTIVE and tanks performance. Virtual teams often confuse the two. Someone who disagrees with your idea isn't attacking you personally - they're improving the work.

<b>Task conflict</b> (disagreement about work content, approaches, and decisions - generally productive) helps teams avoid groupthink. <b>Relationship conflict</b> (interpersonal tension, personality clashes, emotional negativity - generally destructive) should be addressed through psychological safety building and sometimes mediation.

"Leverage cultural differences as asset" - The research shows contextual diversity improves outcomes IF teams use it strategically. Example: When analyzing a business problem, explicitly ask "What would this look like from a Vietnamese perspective? German perspective? American perspective?" Different cultural lenses reveal blind spots.

Practical application: Student teams preparing group presentations should use this slide as a checklist. Are you meeting regularly via video? Have you established response time norms? Are you building informal relationships? Are you addressing conflicts early? If no to any of these, your team is at risk.

# Synthesis & Takeaways

**Bringing the frameworks together**

<speaker-notes>
Transition to wrap-up. Students have absorbed four major frameworks - now we synthesize them into integrated understanding and provide clear next steps.

Emphasize that these frameworks are tools, not rules. The goal is cultural intelligence - adapting your communication based on context while remaining authentic.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="33" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

**1. Culture is relative:**
What matters is the DISTANCE between cultures, not absolute scores. Adapt based on the gap between you and your communication partner.

**2. Psychological safety enables performance:**
High Safety + High Accountability = Learning Zone. Teams that feel safe to take risks outperform teams that don't, regardless of talent.

**3. Adapt feedback to culture:**
Use Meyer's Three A's (Aim to Assist, Actionable, Ask First) and match upgrader/downgrader style to your recipient's culture.

**4. Leverage diversity as strength:**
Contextual diversity improves outcomes if you manage personal diversity challenges through explicit norms and psychological safety.

<speaker-notes>
These four takeaways map to the four frameworks taught today. Students should be able to connect each takeaway to specific concepts:

Takeaway 1 → Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions (Part 1)
Takeaway 2 → Edmondson's Psychological Safety (Part 2)
Takeaway 3 → Meyer's Cross-Cultural Feedback (Part 3)
Takeaway 4 → Taras et al.'s Personal vs. Contextual Diversity (Part 4)

Reinforce that these aren't separate topics - they integrate:
- Cultural dimensions (Hofstede) explain WHY psychological safety looks different across cultures
- Psychological safety (Edmondson) enables effective cross-cultural feedback
- Cross-cultural feedback (Meyer) helps manage the relationship challenges of diverse teams
- Understanding diversity types (Taras) helps teams leverage differences strategically

Real-world integration example: A Vietnamese team leader (high Power Distance culture) working with a Danish team member (low Power Distance culture) can:
1. Recognize the 52-point PDI gap (Hofstede)
2. Build safety by inviting the Danish member to challenge ideas (Edmondson)
3. Use upgrader feedback style when giving the Danish member criticism (Meyer)
4. Leverage the contextual diversity of Vietnamese-Danish perspectives for better solutions (Taras)

All four frameworks work together to enable effective cross-cultural collaboration.

Question to pose: "How will you apply these frameworks in your group presentation team?" Give students 30 seconds to think, then take 2-3 responses. This reinforces the assessment connection.

## Group Presentation (Week 12)

**How today's frameworks help your team succeed:**

✓ **Hofstede's dimensions:** Identify cultural gaps in your team, adapt communication styles
✓ **Psychological safety:** Create climate where all members contribute ideas without fear
✓ **Three A's feedback:** Give each other helpful criticism without damaging relationships
✓ **Diversity leverage:** Use different backgrounds as strength, not obstacle

**Between now and Week 12:**
- Form teams (if not already) and assess cultural diversity
- Establish explicit team communication norms (Power Distance, feedback style, decision-making)
- Build psychological safety through regular check-ins and inclusive practices
- Practice cross-cultural feedback using Ask First and appropriate directness

<speaker-notes>
Direct connection to the 40% assessment (25% group + 15% individual presentation grade). Students should see these frameworks as immediately applicable tools, not just theoretical concepts.

Emphasize the timeline: Teams have 3 weeks to prepare. The first week should focus on team formation and norm-setting (using today's frameworks), not just jumping into content.

Common student mistake: Teams skip the relationship-building phase and go straight to task division. Result: conflicts emerge later when people have different work styles, feedback expectations, or cultural assumptions. Spending 30 minutes in Week 9-10 establishing norms prevents hours of conflict in Week 11-12.

Specific action items for students:
1. **Cultural assessment:** Have each team member complete the Hofstede cultural dimensions self-assessment at hofstede-insights.com. Compare profiles to identify largest gaps.

2. **Norm negotiation:** Discuss and write down:
   - How will we make decisions? (Voting? Consensus? Leader?)
   - How will we give feedback? (Direct or indirect? Public or private?)
   - How will we handle conflict? (Address immediately or cool off first?)
   - How will we ensure equal participation? (Round-robin? Rotating facilitator?)

3. **Safety building:** Use one of Edmondson's three leader behaviors each meeting:
   - Week 10: Set the Stage ("This is a learning challenge, we'll all make mistakes")
   - Week 11: Invite Participation ("What are we missing in our analysis?")
   - Week 12: Respond Productively ("Thank you for raising that concern")

4. **Diversity leverage:** Assign presentation sections based on contextual diversity - let the marketing major handle audience analysis, the engineer handle visual design, etc.

The tutorial today provides practice with these skills in a low-stakes environment. What they practice today transfers directly to their teams.

Motivational note: Teams that invest in relationship building early produce better final presentations AND report higher satisfaction. It's not just about the grade - it's about having a positive team experience rather than a stressful one.

## Week 10: Integration & Capstone

**Synthesizing course learning and planning for continuous improvement**

**Topics:**
- Capstone presentation preparation (bringing frameworks together)
- Self-assessment of personal communication growth
- Development planning for continuous improvement
- Course synthesis (integrating all frameworks from Weeks 1-9)

**Why it matters:**
Week 10 wraps up new content and focuses on integration. You'll reflect on your communication journey from Week 1 to Week 9 and create a personal development plan. This sets you up for success in the final assessments.

**Preparation:**
Review your work from Weeks 1-9. What communication skills have improved? Where do you still struggle? Bring examples to tutorial.

<speaker-notes>
Week 10 preview signals the end of new content and the beginning of integration and assessment prep. This helps students mentally prepare for the shift from learning to applying.

Frame Week 10 as different from previous weeks - it's reflective and synthetic rather than introducing new frameworks. Students will use the Reflective Practice Model (Schön) and Experiential Learning Cycle (Kolb) to assess their own growth.

The self-assessment work in Week 10 feeds into the Individual Presentation Grade (15%) because students need to demonstrate self-awareness and development planning as part of their professionalism score.

Practical prep for students: "Between now and next week, review your portfolio work from Weeks 1-9. Look at your first memo from Week 4 and compare it to your most recent writing. How has your communication changed? What frameworks do you now apply automatically that you didn't use before?"

This reflection primes students for Week 10's capstone activities and helps them articulate their learning for the Individual Presentation assessment.

Cultural note: Vietnamese education traditionally emphasizes teacher evaluation over self-evaluation. Week 10's self-assessment may feel unfamiliar. Reassure students that self-awareness is a valued professional skill globally, and that honest self-assessment leads to faster development.

The development plan created in Week 10 can be useful beyond this course - students can bring it to job interviews when asked about their communication strengths and development areas.

## Further Resources (Optional)

**Tools:**
- Hofstede Country Comparison: hofstede-insights.com
- Meyer's Culture Map Assessment: erinmeyer.com
- CQ (Cultural Intelligence) Self-Assessment: culturalq.com
- Psychological Safety Survey: Edmondson's 7-item scale (Slide 17)

**Videos:**
- Erin Meyer - "The Culture Map" (13:47) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQvqOCHPJdE
  - Why watch: See Meyer explain upgraders vs. downgraders with real examples
- Project Aristotle (Google) - "The Five Keys to a Successful Team" (4:23) - https://youtu.be/hHIikHJV9fI
  - Why watch: Psychological safety as #1 predictor of team success

**Not required** - All assessed material covered in readings and lecture.

<speaker-notes>
Brief mention: "For those interested in going deeper, I've linked some excellent free tools and short videos. They're optional but highly recommended if you want to assess your own cultural profile or see these concepts in action with real teams."

The Hofstede tool is particularly useful - students can compare Vietnam with any country their classmates or future colleagues come from. It generates a visual chart showing the gaps on all six dimensions.

Meyer's website has a free mini-assessment that gives students a rough sense of their position on the Culture Map's eight scales (Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, etc.). The full assessment costs money, but the free version is sufficient for student purposes.

The Google video on Project Aristotle is 4 minutes and brilliantly demonstrates why psychological safety matters more than team composition. Highly recommend students watch it before their group presentation prep.

These resources are supplementary - emphasize that students will NOT be tested on material that only appears in these resources. All quiz content comes from lecture and required readings.
