### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Start by asking students: "How many of you have worked with team members from different countries or cultural backgrounds?"
- "Today we're going to challenge the assumption that cultural diversity is always a problem to overcome—research shows it can be your competitive advantage"

**Key Points:**
- 89% statistic from global study of 5,728 individuals across 804 teams in 90 countries
- Most research until recently focused on negative diversity effects—this is changing
- Vietnamese students increasingly work in multinational companies (Samsung, Intel, Microsoft) where cross-cultural skills are essential

**Example:**
- Samsung Vietnam employs 160,000+ workers with Korean management teams—understanding power distance and feedback culture directly affects promotion prospects

**Check Understanding:**
- "Before we dive in, what's one challenge you think cultural differences create in teams?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's build the frameworks to turn these challenges into strengths"

<!-- Slide 2: Objectives -->
## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Hofstede's cultural dimensions to analyze communication challenges across cultures
2. **Design** communication strategies for virtual teams using psychological safety principles
3. **Evaluate** feedback approaches using Meyer's Three A's framework
4. **Create** team communication protocols that leverage contextual diversity

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Four concrete skills you'll practice in today's tutorial and use in your Week 12 Group Presentation"

**Key Points:**
- LO1 = Foundation (understanding the framework)
- LO2 = Virtual context (your reality as students and professionals)
- LO3 = Practical application (giving/receiving feedback)
- LO4 = Assessment connection (team protocols for presentations)

**Example:**
- "By next week, when you start preparing your group presentations, you'll have tools to manage time zones, feedback styles, and decision-making preferences"

**Check Understanding:**
- Point to each objective: "This is the 'what', 'how', 'when', and 'why' of today"

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect these skills to what you'll be graded on"

---

<!-- Slide 3: Assessment Connection -->
## How This Prepares You for Group Presentation (Week 12)
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Today → Week 12 Journey:**

| Week | Focus | How Today Helps |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **9 (Today)** | Cross-cultural frameworks | Understand team diversity as asset |
| **10** | Capstone integration | Apply all frameworks to presentation prep |
| **11** | Review & practice | Rehearse with cultural awareness |
| **12** | Group Presentation | Deliver with confident team dynamics |

**Graded Components Using Today's Skills:**
- **Group Presentation (25%):** Team coordination, role clarity, seamless transitions
- **Individual Grade (15%):** Your contribution within diverse team context

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Your group presentations are just 3 weeks away—today's frameworks directly prepare you"

**Key Points:**
- Most students form groups with friends = similar backgrounds; real workplaces = diverse teams
- Your individual grade depends partly on how well you coordinate with teammates
- Cultural dimensions affect: who speaks first, how you give feedback on drafts, how you make decisions about content

**Example:**
- "If your group has both Vietnamese and international students, understanding high vs. low power distance helps you create equal speaking opportunities"
- "Virtual team principles apply even if you meet in person—you'll coordinate via Zalo, email, shared docs"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Who's already formed their group? What's one challenge you anticipate in coordinating?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see how the top business schools prepare students for these exact situations"

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with the most cited framework in cross-cultural business communication"

---

<!-- SECTION 1: CULTURAL DIMENSIONS -->

<!-- Slide 5: Section Break -->
## Part 1: Cultural Dimensions in Communication
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

Understanding the invisible forces shaping how we communicate

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Culture is like water to fish—we don't notice it until we encounter a different culture"

**Key Points:**
- Geert Hofstede's research = 117,000 IBM employees across 40 countries (later 76 countries)
- Most influential framework in cross-cultural business—taught at every M7 business school
- 33,000+ citations on Google Scholar; Wall Street Journal Top 20 business thinker (2008)

**Example:**
- "Hofstede started at IBM in the 1960s and noticed that management practices that worked in the US failed in Japan—not because of poor execution, but because of cultural assumptions"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Before we see the framework, what's one way you think Vietnamese workplace culture differs from Western culture?"

**Transition:**
- "Here's the vocabulary to describe those differences precisely"

---

<!-- Slide 6: Hofstede's Definition -->
## Culture: The Collective Programming of the Mind
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "Culture is the collective programming of the mind distinguishing the members of one group or category of people from others."
>
> — Geert Hofstede (2001)

**Key Insight:** Culture is learned, not innate—it can be understood and navigated.

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Read the quote slowly—'collective programming' sounds robotic, but it's accurate"

**Key Points:**
- Culture = shared mental software acquired from social environment (family, school, workplace)
- Not about individuals—about group patterns and averages
- Culture changes slowly (across generations) but does change
- Understanding your own cultural programming is the first step to navigating others'

**Example:**
- "Vietnamese students often wait for instructor to call on them rather than raising hands spontaneously—this isn't shyness, it's culturally programmed respect for hierarchy"
- "American students often interrupt with questions—this isn't rudeness, it's culturally programmed emphasis on individual participation"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think of one behavior you do automatically at work or school that someone from another culture might find strange"

**Transition:**
- "Hofstede identified 6 dimensions where cultures systematically differ"

---

<!-- Slide 7: Hofstede's 6 Cultural Dimensions -->
## Hofstede's Six Cultural Dimensions
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

| Dimension | Low Score Cultures | High Score Cultures |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Power Distance** | Hierarchy for convenience | Hierarchy reflects inequality |
| **Individualism** | "We" identity, loyalty | "I" identity, autonomy |
| **Masculinity** | Caring for others valued | Achievement valued |
| **Uncertainty Avoidance** | Comfortable with ambiguity | Need for rules and structure |
| **Long-Term Orientation** | Respect for tradition | Adaptation and persistence |
| **Indulgence** | Gratification restrained | Gratification encouraged |

**Key Principle:** Cultures are *relative* to each other—no dimension is inherently good or bad.

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These are sliding scales from 0-100, not binary categories"

**Key Points:**
- **Power Distance (PDI):** How much less powerful members accept unequal distribution
- **Individualism (IDV):** Degree to which people integrate into groups
- **Masculinity (MAS):** Distribution of values between achievement and caring (dated term, but standard in research)
- **Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI):** Society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity
- **Long-Term Orientation (LTO):** Focus on future rewards vs. past/present
- **Indulgence (IVR):** Freedom to enjoy life and have fun

**Example:**
- "Vietnam scores HIGH on power distance—respect for hierarchy"
- "USA scores HIGH on individualism—individual achievement prioritized"
- "Neither is better—both have strengths and costs"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which dimension do you think affects business meetings the most?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at Vietnam's specific profile"

---

<!-- Slide 8: Vietnam's Cultural Profile -->
## Vietnam on Hofstede's Dimensions
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

| Dimension | Vietnam Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Power Distance** | 70 (High) | Hierarchical society; managers expect obedience |
| **Individualism** | 20 (Low—Collectivist) | Strong "we" identity; group harmony valued |
| **Masculinity** | 40 (Moderate) | Balance between competition and care |
| **Uncertainty Avoidance** | 30 (Low) | Comfortable with ambiguity; flexible rules |
| **Long-Term Orientation** | 57 (Moderate-High) | Values persistence and adaptation |
| **Indulgence** | 35 (Restrained) | Work before pleasure; self-discipline valued |

**Communication Implications:**
- Indirect disagreement (preserve harmony)
- Respect seniority in speaking order
- Comfortable with flexible plans
- Focus on long-term relationships

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Here's Vietnam through Hofstede's framework—compare this to your experience"

**Key Points:**
- **High PDI + Low IDV** = Vietnamese students often hesitate to challenge instructors or senior colleagues
- **Low UAI** = Paradoxically, Vietnamese are comfortable with ambiguity and last-minute changes (despite high PDI)
- **Moderate LTO** = Values both respect for elders (past) and adaptation (future)
- These are averages—individuals vary widely

**Example:**
- "In Vietnamese companies, junior staff often say 'Em xin phép' (I humbly ask permission) before speaking—this signals respect for hierarchy"
- "In Australian companies, calling your boss by first name and disagreeing directly is normal—low power distance"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Does this profile match your experience growing up in Vietnam? What surprises you?"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's compare Vietnam to cultures your classmates or future colleagues might come from"

<!-- Slide 9: Cross-Cultural Comparison: Vietnam, USA, Japan, Germany -->
## How Vietnam Compares: Four Cultural Profiles
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

| Dimension | Vietnam | USA | Japan | Germany |
|-----------|---------|-----|-------|---------|
| Power Distance | 70 | 40 | 54 | 35 |
| Individualism | 20 | 91 | 46 | 67 |
| Masculinity | 40 | 62 | 95 | 66 |
| Uncertainty Avoidance | 30 | 46 | 92 | 65 |
| Long-Term Orientation | 57 | 26 | 88 | 83 |
| Indulgence | 35 | 68 | 42 | 40 |

**Biggest Contrasts:**
- **Vietnam vs. USA:** Power distance (70 vs. 40), Individualism (20 vs. 91)
- **Vietnam vs. Japan:** Uncertainty avoidance (30 vs. 92), Masculinity (40 vs. 95)
- **Vietnam vs. Germany:** Individualism (20 vs. 67), Long-term orientation (57 vs. 83)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These four countries represent major business partners for Vietnam—Samsung (Korea/similar to Japan), Intel (USA), Bosch (Germany)"

**Key Points:**
- **Vietnam-USA clash:** Americans expect direct feedback and individual initiative; Vietnamese expect indirect cues and group consensus
- **Vietnam-Japan clash:** Japanese want detailed plans before action; Vietnamese adapt as they go
- **Vietnam-Germany clash:** Germans value individual accountability; Vietnamese value collective responsibility
- Notice Japan and Germany are both "Western" but very different from each other—culture ≠ geography

**Example:**
- "American manager to Vietnamese team: 'What do YOU think we should do?' (expects individual opinion)"
- "Vietnamese team member thinks: 'Why is the manager asking me? They should decide and tell us' (expects hierarchy)"
- Both are confused, neither is wrong—just different PDI programming

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you're working with an American manager, which dimension difference will create the biggest challenge?"

**Transition:**
- "These dimensions directly affect how we give and receive feedback—let's see three real cases"

---

<!-- Slide 10: Case Study - Olga: Ukrainian Manager in West Virginia -->
## Case Study: When Direct Feedback Backfires
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Context:** Olga, Ukrainian HR executive, relocates to West Virginia for US operations

**Challenge:** Used to giving direct feedback in Ukraine:
- "This absolutely cannot continue"
- "Reply-all" emails with criticism
- Immediate correction of mistakes in meetings

**What Happened:**
- American team felt attacked and "bullied"
- Complaints to senior leadership
- Olga confused: "I'm just being honest and efficient"

**Cultural Analysis:**
- Ukraine (PDI 92, UAI 95): Direct feedback signals respect and seriousness
- USA (PDI 40, IDV 91): Direct criticism threatens individual face; use "sandwich method"

**Lesson:** Even "Western" cultures differ dramatically in feedback directness

**Source:** Meyer (2023), "When Diversity Meets Feedback," *Harvard Business Review*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's see cultural dimensions in action—real case from Harvard Business Review 2023"

**Key Points:**
- Olga wasn't being mean—she was using Ukrainian professional norms
- Americans weren't being oversensitive—they were expecting American professional norms
- Both Ukraine and USA are "Western" and "direct communicators" but differ on EVALUATING dimension (feedback)
- This shows Hofstede's dimensions are just starting point—need more nuanced frameworks too

**Example:**
- "In Vietnamese context: Olga's approach would be even more shocking because high PDI = face-saving is critical"
- "Imagine Vietnamese employee receiving 'This absolutely cannot continue' in front of peers—devastating"

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you were Olga's coach, what one change would you suggest for working with Americans?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see the opposite problem—American manager in Asia"

---

<!-- Slide 11: Case Study - Jethro: American VP in Thailand -->
## Case Study: When "Constructive" Feedback Offends
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Context:** Jethro, American VP, gives performance review via video to Thai team member

**What Jethro Said:**
- "Here are three areas where you're excelling"
- "Here are two areas for improvement: [specific details]"
- "Let's make a development plan for the next quarter"

**What Happened:**
- Thai employee filed complaint for "bullying"
- Thai HR intervened: "You cannot criticize people directly"
- Jethro shocked: "I followed the best practice feedback model!"

**Cultural Analysis:**
- USA (IDV 91): Direct feedback = respect for growth and development
- Thailand (PDI 64, Collectivist): Direct criticism = loss of face; "say the good, leave out the bad"

**Adaptation:**
- Thai HR taught Jethro: "Praise what's good, imply what needs improvement through questions"
- Example: "Your reports are thorough. What would make them even more impactful for executives?"

**Lesson:** "Best practice" = culturally specific

**Source:** Meyer (2023), "When Diversity Meets Feedback," *Harvard Business Review*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Same year, opposite problem—now the American is too direct"

**Key Points:**
- Jethro used the "sandwich method" (positive-negative-positive) taught in US business schools
- Even this was too direct for Thai context where harmony > individual development
- Thailand (similar to Vietnam) = high context, indirect communication, face-saving critical
- Notice Jethro had good intentions and training—still failed because of cultural gap

**Example:**
- "Vietnamese equivalent: Instead of 'Your presentation needs better structure,' say 'Your content is strong; I'm wondering how we might guide the audience's attention even more clearly'"
- "The message is the same, but the delivery preserves face and group harmony"

**Check Understanding:**
- "How would you give developmental feedback to a classmate on their draft presentation?"

**Transition:**
- "One more case—this time about WHEN to give feedback, not just how"

---

<!-- Slide 12: Case Study - Cassandra: Unsolicited Advice -->
## Case Study: When Feedback Violates Power Dynamics
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Context:** Cassandra, female software VP, delivers keynote presentation

**What Happened:**
- Male colleague Miles (her peer) sends detailed email next day
- "Here are five tips to improve your presentations:"
- Lists: vocal variety, pause techniques, slide design suggestions
- Signs off: "Hope this helps!"

**Cassandra's Reaction:**
- Felt self-confidence "hijacked"
- Advice was technically correct but completely unrequested
- "I've been presenting for 15 years—why does he think I need his coaching?"

**The Hidden Issue:**
- **Gender + Power Dynamics:** Research shows men give unrequested advice to women 5× more than to other men
- **Violates "Ask First" principle** (covered in next section)

**Lesson:** Even actionable, well-intentioned feedback can damage relationships when power dynamics are ignored

**Source:** Meyer (2023), "When Diversity Meets Feedback," *Harvard Business Review*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This case isn't about national culture—it's about gender culture and power"

**Key Points:**
- Miles probably thought he was being helpful and collegial
- 90%+ of women report receiving unsolicited advice from male colleagues
- Men rarely give unrequested advice to other men at same level
- This intersects with cultural dimensions: in high PDI cultures, junior advising senior is unthinkable
- Even in low PDI cultures (like USA), gender and seniority matter

**Example:**
- "Imagine Vietnamese context: Would a junior male employee email unsolicited presentation tips to a senior female leader? Never—hierarchy prevents it"
- "But what about two peers of different genders? Research shows the pattern persists globally"

**Check Understanding:**
- "In your group project, how will you ensure all members feel empowered to give AND receive feedback?"

**Transition:**
- "These three cases show why we need structured frameworks for cross-cultural feedback—let's learn one"

<!-- SECTION 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY -->

<!-- Slide 13: Section Break -->
## Part 2: Building Psychological Safety in Teams
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

Why some teams enable voice and others silence it

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Quick recap: we've learned WHAT cultural differences exist. Now: WHY do some diverse teams thrive despite differences?"

**Key Points:**
- Amy Edmondson's psychological safety = most important predictor of team success
- Google's Project Aristotle studied 180 teams: psychological safety = #1 factor
- 92,000+ citations for Edmondson's work—taught at Harvard, Stanford, all M7 schools
- Psychological safety ≠ trust, ≠ niceness, ≠ low standards

**Example:**
- "Two Vietnamese students working on group project with two international students"
- "Low safety: Vietnamese students stay quiet in meetings, do extra work alone to avoid speaking up"
- "High safety: All four openly say 'I'm confused about the deadline' or 'I disagree with this approach'"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about a team where you felt comfortable speaking up. What made it safe?"

**Transition:**
- "Here's Edmondson's precise definition"

---

<!-- Slide 14: Psychological Safety Definition -->
## What Is Psychological Safety?
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking."
>
> — Amy C. Edmondson (1999)

**Not the Same As:**
- ❌ Trust (expectations about others' future actions)
- ❌ Group cohesiveness (can reduce willingness to challenge)
- ❌ "Being nice" (safety enables the candid feedback that niceness avoids)

**Key Insight:** Safety is about the *team climate*, not individual relationships.

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Write down the definition—it'll be on the quiz"

**Key Points:**
- "Shared belief" = everyone on team feels it; not just leader-to-member but peer-to-peer
- "Interpersonal risk taking" = asking questions, admitting mistakes, challenging status quo, offering wild ideas
- Distinction from trust: trust = "I believe you'll keep your word"; safety = "I believe the team won't punish me for speaking up"
- Distinction from cohesiveness: very cohesive teams can have groupthink; safety requires comfort with disagreement

**Example:**
- "Vietnamese university group: high cohesiveness (everyone friends), low safety (no one challenges others' ideas)"
- "Workplace team: moderate cohesiveness (cordial but not friends), high safety (vigorous debates in meetings)"
- Which produces better work? Research shows the second one.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can you have high trust but low psychological safety? Give an example."

**Transition:**
- "Edmondson created a framework showing psychological safety isn't enough alone"

---

<!-- Slide 15: The Four Zones Framework -->
## The Four Zones: Safety × Accountability
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

|  | **Low Accountability** | **High Accountability** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Psychological Safety** | **Comfort Zone**<br>Safe but complacent<br>No pressure to perform | **Learning Zone** ⭐<br>Optimal performance<br>Innovation + execution |
| **Low Psychological Safety** | **Apathy Zone**<br>Minimal effort<br>"Why bother?" | **Anxiety Zone**<br>Fear-driven work<br>Burnout + politics |

**Your Group Presentation Goal:** Create Learning Zone (high safety + high accountability)

**How:**
- High safety: Everyone can propose ideas without judgment
- High accountability: Everyone delivers on commitments

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Draw this 2×2 matrix in your notes—you'll use it for tutorial activity"

**Key Points:**
- **Comfort Zone:** Nice team, no standards = no growth (common in student projects where everyone is friends)
- **Anxiety Zone:** High standards, fear of speaking up = burnout (common in high-pressure corporate cultures)
- **Apathy Zone:** Nobody cares about quality or climate = worst outcome
- **Learning Zone:** The sweet spot—people challenge each other AND support each other
- Vietnamese teams often start in Anxiety Zone (high PDI = fear of senior/leader) or Comfort Zone (collectivism = harmony over candor)

**Example:**
- "Comfort Zone: Your group meets, everyone says 'looks good,' nobody revises, presentation is mediocre"
- "Learning Zone: Your group meets, someone says 'I think our argument is weak here,' team debates, everyone revises, presentation is excellent"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which zone is your current group project in? What would move you toward Learning Zone?"

**Transition:**
- "How do leaders create Learning Zone? Edmondson has a three-step process"

---

<!-- Slide 16: Building Psychological Safety: Leader Actions -->
## Three Leadership Practices for Psychological Safety
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**1. Set the Stage**
- Frame work as *learning problem*, not execution problem
- Acknowledge your own fallibility as leader
- "I don't have all the answers—I need everyone's input"

**2. Invite Participation**
- Ask proactive questions: "What are we missing?"
- Design structures for input (anonymous surveys, round-robin)
- Create space for quiet voices

**3. Respond Productively**
- Express appreciation even for critical feedback
- Destigmatize failure: "What did we learn?"
- Offer help and solutions, not blame

**Cultural Note:** These practices work globally but require adaptation—e.g., high PDI cultures need extra emphasis on "Set the Stage" to overcome hierarchy.

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These aren't just for managers—anyone can create safety in their group"

**Key Points:**
- **Set the Stage = Permission:** Vietnamese students especially need explicit permission to speak up because high PDI
- **Invite Participation = Structure:** Don't just say "any questions?"—use specific prompts and wait time
- **Respond Productively = Modeling:** The first time someone challenges an idea, how you respond determines whether others will
- In Vietnamese context: "Set the Stage" means saying "I want us to be in Learning Zone—please question my ideas"

**Example:**
- **Bad response to challenge:** "That won't work because [dismissive reasons]" → silence for rest of project
- **Good response:** "That's a great question—I hadn't considered that angle. Let's explore it together."

**Check Understanding:**
- "Who's the designated leader in your group project? What's one thing they could do to Set the Stage next meeting?"

**Transition:**
- "Psychological safety enables cross-cultural teams to leverage their diversity—let's see the research"

<!-- SECTION 3: CROSS-CULTURAL FEEDBACK -->

<!-- Slide 17: Section Break -->
## Part 3: Cross-Cultural Feedback Mastery
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

Erin Meyer's practical framework for giving feedback across cultures

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "We've seen WHAT cultural dimensions exist and WHY safety matters. Now: HOW to give feedback across cultures."

**Key Points:**
- Erin Meyer = INSEAD professor, author of *The Culture Map*
- Her "Three A's" framework = practitioner favorite (simpler than Hofstede, more actionable)
- Based on 20+ years consulting with global companies
- Featured in INSEAD executive program "Leading Across Borders and Cultures"

**Example:**
- "You'll use this framework in tutorial today and in Week 12 when giving feedback to teammates on presentation drafts"

**Check Understanding:**
- "From the three case studies earlier, what's one mistake you want to avoid when giving feedback?"

**Transition:**
- "Here's Meyer's framework for getting feedback right"

---

<!-- Slide 18: Meyer's Three A's of Feedback -->
## The Three A's of Effective Cross-Cultural Feedback
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**1. Aim to Assist**
- Give feedback *only* with genuine intention to help
- NEVER to vent frustration or assert dominance
- Check your motivation before speaking

**2. Actionable**
- Must include clear actions recipient can take
- If no action exists, withhold the feedback
- Vague criticism helps no one

**3. Ask First**
- Request feedback on your own work before giving feedback to others
- Balances power dynamics
- Creates reciprocal culture

**The Golden Rule, Revised:**
"Do unto others as *they* would have done unto themselves"—not as *you* would want it.

**Source:** Meyer (2023), "When Diversity Meets Feedback," *Harvard Business Review*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Three simple rules that prevent 90% of cross-cultural feedback disasters"

**Key Points:**
- **Aim to Assist:** Cassandra case violated this—Miles aimed to show expertise, not genuinely help
- **Actionable:** "Your presentation wasn't engaging" = useless; "Pause 3 seconds after key points to let them land" = actionable
- **Ask First:** Solves the Cassandra problem—if Miles had asked "Want feedback on your presentation style?" she could decline
- Vietnamese context: "Ask First" is culturally aligned with high PDI (respects hierarchy and face-saving)

**Example:**
- **Violates all three:** "Your slides are terrible" (not actionable, probably not aiming to assist, unrequested)
- **Follows all three:** "I'm working on my slide design—would you be willing to exchange feedback? Here are two specific things I'd love your input on in my deck."

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which of the three A's do you find easiest? Hardest? Why?"

**Transition:**
- "Even when you follow the Three A's, HOW you phrase feedback matters enormously across cultures"

---

<!-- Slide 19: Upgraders vs. Downgraders -->
## Cultural Language Patterns: Upgraders vs. Downgraders
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

| **Direct Feedback Cultures** (Use Upgraders) | **Indirect Feedback Cultures** (Use Downgraders) |
|---|---|
| **Countries:** Germany, Netherlands, Russia, Israel | **Countries:** Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam |
| **Language Patterns:** "absolutely," "totally," "completely wrong" | **Language Patterns:** "kind of," "a little bit," "maybe," "sort of" |
| **Philosophy:** Clarity = respect; directness = professionalism | **Philosophy:** Harmony = respect; indirectness = professionalism |
| **Criticism Style:** State the problem plainly | **Criticism Style:** "Say the good, leave out the bad" |

**The Counterintuitive Insight:**
- Americans = LOW-context communicators but INDIRECT with negative feedback
- French = HIGH-context communicators but DIRECT with criticism

**Implication:** You must map cultures on BOTH dimensions (communicating + evaluating).

**Source:** Meyer (2014), *The Culture Map*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This explains why the same feedback feels helpful to Germans and insulting to Thais"

**Key Points:**
- "Upgraders" intensify the message ("This is totally unacceptable")
- "Downgraders" soften the message ("This is maybe not quite ideal")
- Both cultures understand the message—but emotional impact differs drastically
- Vietnamese students using English: avoid upgraders when giving feedback to international peers
- Vietnamese students receiving feedback from Germans/Dutch: don't personalize their directness

**Example:**
- **German to Vietnamese:** "This structure is completely wrong" (meant as helpful clarity)
- **Vietnamese hears:** "You're incompetent" (feels devastating)
- **Vietnamese to German:** "Perhaps we might consider a slightly different approach" (meant as face-saving)
- **German hears:** "Sounds fine, no action needed" (misses the criticism)

**Check Understanding:**
- "What language pattern does Vietnamese culture use—upgraders or downgraders?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see Meyer's full framework positioning countries on two dimensions"

---

<!-- Slide 20: The Culture Map: Evaluating Dimension -->
## Where Countries Fall: Direct vs. Indirect Feedback
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Most Direct Negative Feedback:**
1. Netherlands, Germany
2. Russia, France, Israel
3. Spain, Italy
4. USA, Canada, Australia
5. UK, Singapore
6. Brazil, Mexico, India
7. China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand

**Most Indirect Negative Feedback**

**Key Insight for Vietnamese Students:**
- Vietnam = indirect feedback culture (position 7)
- Most international business contexts = more direct (positions 1-5)
- Adapt your style to be more explicit when working with Western cultures
- Use downgraders when working with other Asian cultures

**Practical Rule:**
- More direct than your culture → add softeners ("I wonder if we might consider...")
- More indirect than your culture → add clarity ("Specifically, I suggest...")

**Source:** Meyer (2014), *The Culture Map*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Save this slide—you'll reference it for every international interaction"

**Key Points:**
- Position is RELATIVE to other cultures—there's no "absolute" directness
- Vietnam clusters with Thailand and Japan at indirect end
- Notice USA is in the middle (position 4)—more direct than Vietnam, less direct than Germany
- Singapore is interesting—more direct than other Asian countries because of British colonial influence
- Your Group Presentation: if mixing Vietnamese and Western students, establish explicit norms

**Example:**
- "Vietnamese student giving feedback to German student: 'I think we should restructure Section 2 to put the conclusion first' (direct for Vietnamese, still too indirect for German)"
- "Better: 'Section 2 needs restructuring. I recommend moving the conclusion to the opening paragraph. Can we revise by Friday?'"

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you're working with someone from Thailand, should you be more or less direct than with someone from Australia?"

**Transition:**
- "These frameworks apply powerfully to virtual teams—let's see why"

## Part 4: Leveraging Team Diversity
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

Why contextual diversity outperforms homogeneity

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Final segment: putting it all together for your group presentations"

**Key Points:**
- Most students fear diversity = more work and conflict
- Research: contextual diversity (different backgrounds) = BETTER outcomes
- Study: 5,728 individuals, 804 teams, 90 countries—largest global virtual team study ever
- Finding: diverse teams produced higher-quality work than homogeneous teams

**Example:**
- "Your group with Vietnamese + international students has a potential advantage over all-Vietnamese group"
- "Why? Different perspectives catch blind spots"

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's one advantage of having teammates with different cultural backgrounds?"

**Transition:**
- "But not all diversity works the same way—let's distinguish types"

---

<!-- Slide 22: Personal vs. Contextual Diversity -->
## Two Types of Diversity: Different Effects
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

| Diversity Type | Definition | Primary Impact | Effect on Performance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Personal Diversity** | Individual characteristics: age, gender, race, personality | **Psychological outcomes**<br>(satisfaction, cohesion, conflict) | ⚠️ Can be negative without active management |
| **Contextual Diversity** | Background factors: country, industry, functional expertise, education | **Task outcomes**<br>(quality, creativity, innovation) | ✅ Positive—diverse perspectives improve solutions |

**Key Research Finding:**
"Teams with higher contextual diversity produced higher-quality consulting reports, and their solutions were more creative and innovative."

**Implication:** Leverage contextual diversity (different majors, work experiences, countries) as competitive advantage.

**Source:** Taras et al. (2021), "How Cultural Differences Can Impact Global Teams," *Harvard Business Review*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This distinction is crucial—not all diversity is equally challenging or beneficial"

**Key Points:**
- **Personal diversity:** Visible/demographic differences → affects team climate and trust
- **Contextual diversity:** Background and expertise differences → affects work quality
- Research shows contextual diversity benefits typically outweigh personal diversity challenges
- But: personal diversity needs active management (this is where psychological safety comes in)
- Your group projects: leverage contextual (different strengths, perspectives) while managing personal (communication styles)

**Example:**
- **Contextual diversity example:** Vietnamese student studied marketing, American student studied finance, Thai student worked in tech startup → each brings unique lens to business problem
- **Personal diversity challenge:** Different communication styles cause misunderstandings → needs explicit team norms

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which type of diversity is more relevant to your group project—personal or contextual?"

**Transition:**
- "So how do we maximize contextual diversity's benefits while managing personal diversity's challenges?"

<!-- Slide 23: What Matters Most: Gender Egalitarianism & Power Distance -->
## The Two Cultural Factors That Predict Team Success
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

**Most Important for Positive Team Outcomes:**

1. **Gender Egalitarianism** (HIGH = better outcomes)
   - Equal voice regardless of gender
   - Challenge: 90%+ women report receiving unsolicited advice from men
   - Action: Establish "Ask First" norm

2. **Absence of Power Distance** (LOW PDI = better outcomes)
   - Flat hierarchy in team interactions
   - Challenge: Vietnamese culture = high PDI
   - Action: Explicitly invite junior members to speak first

**Why These Two?**
Both enable *psychological safety*—the #1 predictor of team effectiveness.

**Source:** Taras et al. (2021), "How Cultural Differences Can Impact Global Teams," *Harvard Business Review*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Of all Hofstede's dimensions, two stand out for team performance"

**Key Points:**
- Gender egalitarianism = everyone's ideas valued equally regardless of gender
- Low power distance = junior members feel comfortable challenging senior members
- Both create conditions for psychological safety → Learning Zone
- Vietnamese teams face structural challenge: high PDI is cultural norm
- Solution: EXPLICITLY create low PDI environment within team ("We're operating as equals in this project")

**Example:**
- **Problem:** Vietnamese group, oldest member's ideas automatically accepted without debate
- **Solution:** "Let's use round-robin: youngest member shares first, then next youngest, etc."
- **Problem:** Female team members hesitate to disagree with male members
- **Solution:** "Before voting, everyone writes their position anonymously, then we reveal"

**Check Understanding:**
- "How will your group ensure equal voice for all members regardless of age, gender, or seniority?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's end with practical protocols you can implement immediately"

---

<!-- Slide 24: Action Protocols for Your Group Presentation -->
## Practical Team Communication Protocols
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Protocol 1: First Meeting—Establish Cultural Norms**
- Share: "I'm from [culture], we tend to [communication style]"
- Decide: "For this project, we'll use [explicit norms]"
- Example: "We'll use Meyer's 'Ask First' before giving feedback"

**Protocol 2: Leverage Contextual Diversity**
- Assign roles based on different strengths: research, design, speaking, logistics
- Each person leads one aspect where they have unique expertise
- Rotate presentation sections so everyone's voice is heard

**Protocol 3: Create Psychological Safety**
- Use Edmondson's "Set the Stage": "We're in Learning Zone—challenge ideas, not people"
- Invite participation: "What are we missing?" not "Any questions?"
- Respond productively: "Great point—I hadn't thought of that"

**Protocol 4: Adapt Feedback Style**
- Map your team on Meyer's scales
- Vietnamese members: add more directness when working with Western members
- Western members: add more softening when working with Asian members

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Copy these four protocols to use in your Week 10 group meeting"

**Key Points:**
- **Protocol 1:** Explicit > implicit; don't assume everyone shares your norms
- **Protocol 2:** This is how you leverage contextual diversity
- **Protocol 3:** This is how you build psychological safety
- **Protocol 4:** This is how you navigate cultural dimensions
- These aren't optional "nice-to-haves"—research shows they predict team performance

**Example:**
- "First meeting script: 'I'm Vietnamese, our culture is indirect with feedback, so if I seem hesitant to criticize, that's why—please push me to be more explicit'"
- "Western student: 'I'm American, we're direct even when giving negative feedback, so if I seem blunt, I'm not being rude—please tell me if I should soften my language'"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which protocol will be hardest for your group to implement? Why?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's wrap up today's journey"

<!-- WRAP-UP SECTION -->

<!-- Slide 25: Key Takeaways -->
## Key Takeaways: Cross-Cultural & Team Communication

**Framework Mastery:**
1. **Hofstede's Dimensions:** Power distance and individualism explain most communication differences between Vietnam and Western cultures
2. **Psychological Safety:** High safety + high accountability = Learning Zone (your goal)
3. **Meyer's Three A's:** Aim to assist, make it actionable, ask first
4. **Diversity Types:** Leverage contextual (backgrounds), manage personal (demographics)

**Practical Application:**
- Vietnam = high PDI, collectivist, indirect feedback → adapt to more direct style with Western collaborators
- Use explicit team protocols (don't assume shared norms)
- Create psychological safety before expecting open communication

**For Week 12 Group Presentation:**
Establish norms early, leverage each member's unique strengths, practice feedback across cultural styles

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Four frameworks, dozens of applications—but they all connect"

**Key Points:**
- These frameworks aren't just academic—they're used by McKinsey, Google, Samsung, every major multinational
- Your competitive advantage in Vietnamese job market: ability to navigate cross-cultural teams
- These skills matter whether you work in Vietnam for multinational or abroad
- 89% of white-collar work involves global teams—this is baseline professional skill now

**Example:**
- "Next time you're in meeting and notice someone isn't speaking up, ask: Is this a PDI issue (hierarchy)? A feedback culture issue (fear of criticism)? A psychological safety issue (team climate)?"
- "Then you can intervene strategically: 'Let's hear from [quiet person] first before the rest of us chime in'"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which framework will you use first in your group project?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect this to your assessments"
