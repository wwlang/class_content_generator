# Week 9 Tutorial: Cross-Cultural & Team Communication

**Learning Objectives:**
Practice team coordination and seamless transitions in preparation for Group Presentation (Week 12)

**Assessment Connection:**
- Group Presentation (25%): Team coordination, equal participation, seamless transitions
- Individual Grade (15%): Your contribution within diverse team context

---

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions:** Power Distance (PDI), Individualism (IDV), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI), Long-Term Orientation (LTO)—Vietnam scores high on PDI (70) and low on IDV (20), affecting team communication patterns
- **Psychological Safety (Edmondson):** Shared belief that team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking; high safety + high accountability = Learning Zone where teams perform best
- **Meyer's Three A's of Feedback:** (1) Aim to Assist, (2) Make it Actionable, (3) Ask First—essential for cross-cultural team feedback
- **Virtual Team Communication:** Explicit norms, cultural adaptation, leveraging contextual diversity as competitive advantage

**What good work looks like:**

- Seamless transitions between speakers with no awkward gaps
- Perfect balance in speaking time—all members contribute equally
- Team appears unified with coordinated message
- Cross-cultural awareness demonstrated in how team members support each other

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Section 4 (Group Presentation)—Team Coordination criterion worth 15%

## Main Activity: Team Presentation Run-Through

**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12) - this activity practices team coordination and smooth transitions for your final presentation

**The Task:**

Work in your actual Week 12 presentation groups to deliver a 5-minute team mini-presentation demonstrating professional coordination, balanced participation, and seamless transitions between speakers.

**Topic for Today's Practice:**

Present a brief analysis of how cross-cultural communication principles apply to your group's actual Week 12 presentation topic. If your group hasn't finalized your topic yet, use this scenario:

"Your team is consulting for a Vietnamese company expanding to [choose: USA, Japan, or Germany]. Present 3 cultural communication challenges they'll face and 3 practical solutions using today's frameworks."

**Deliverable:**

**5-Minute Team Mini-Presentation** with the following structure:

1. **Team Introduction (30 seconds):** One person introduces all team members by name and previews the topic
2. **Main Content (3.5 minutes):** Core analysis divided equally among team members
3. **Conclusion (30 seconds):** One person synthesizes key takeaways
4. **Transition Demonstration (30 seconds):** Show at least 2 exemplary transitions between speakers

**Success Criteria:** (from Group Presentation Rubric - Team Coordination 15%)

- **Seamless transitions:** Speakers build on each other's points explicitly with smooth handoffs—no awkward pauses or "um, next person" moments
- **Perfect balance:** Speaking time divided equally among all members (±15 seconds); no one dominates, no one is silent
- **Appears as unified team:** Coordinated message throughout; team members support each other visually (eye contact, nodding) and verbally (building on previous points)
- **Equal participation:** All members present substantive content, not just introductions or conclusions
- **Cross-cultural awareness:** If team is diverse, demonstrates cultural adaptation in communication styles

**Working Process:**

**Phase 1 - Team Coordination Planning (15 min):**

Before rehearsing content, establish your team coordination protocols:

1. **Assign roles explicitly:**
   - Who introduces the team?
   - Who presents which segment?
   - Who concludes?
   - What's the speaking order?

2. **Plan your transitions:**
   - Write out transition sentences that connect speakers
   - Example: "As [Name] explained, power distance affects hierarchy. Building on that, I'll show how this plays out in meeting dynamics..."
   - Avoid: Awkward silence, "Next slide please," or just starting without connection

3. **Balance speaking time:**
   - Divide 3.5 minutes of core content by number of team members
   - 4 members = ~50 seconds each
   - 3 members = ~70 seconds each
   - Set timers and practice

4. **Establish support mechanisms:**
   - How will you signal if someone goes over time?
   - How will you support each other during Q&A?
   - What if someone freezes or forgets their part?

**Phase 2 - Content Preparation (15 min):**

Develop your brief content:

- Choose 3 cultural dimensions that matter most for your scenario
- Identify 3 specific communication challenges
- Propose 3 practical solutions using lecture frameworks
- Create simple visual support (low-fidelity slides or flipchart is fine)

**Important:** Content quality matters less today than coordination quality. This is a **dry run** focused on team dynamics, not research depth.

**Phase 3 - Rehearsal (15 min):**

Practice your presentation at least twice:

1. **First run:** Full presentation with timing; identify rough spots
2. **Adjustment:** Fix awkward transitions, rebalance speaking time
3. **Second run:** Smooth delivery focusing on coordination

**During rehearsal, check:**
- Are transitions explicit and smooth?
- Is speaking time balanced?
- Do team members make eye contact and support each other?
- Does the presentation feel unified or like disconnected individual sections?

**Phase 4 - Class Presentations & Feedback (35 min):**

3-4 teams will present to the full class (tutor selects). When presenting:

- Deliver your 5-minute presentation
- Handle one Q&A question from tutor or peers
- Receive structured feedback on team coordination

When observing other teams, note:
- Transition quality: Did speakers build on previous points?
- Balance: Was speaking time distributed equally?
- Unity: Did the team appear coordinated?

**Phase 5 - Team Debrief (10 min):**

Within your group, discuss:

1. What went well in our coordination?
2. What transitions felt awkward?
3. Did we achieve equal speaking time?
4. What will we do differently for Week 12?
5. Do we need to adjust our team based on today's experience?

Apply Meyer's Three A's when giving feedback to teammates:
- **Ask First:** "May I give you feedback on your transition into my section?"
- **Aim to Assist:** Give feedback with genuine intention to help the team succeed
- **Make it Actionable:** "Try using my name and the key word from my last sentence: 'As Minh explained about power distance...'"

**Class Feedback:**

All teams must be prepared to present. Tutor will select 3-4 teams based on time available. If your team is selected, all members must participate—this is practice for Week 12's Individual Grade (15%).

When giving feedback to other teams, focus on:
1. **One specific strength in coordination:** "Your transition at 1:45 was excellent because [Name] explicitly built on [Name's] point about..."
2. **One actionable improvement:** "Consider practicing the handoff from Section 2 to Section 3—there was a 4-second gap that made it feel disconnected"

⚠️ **Participation:** This tutorial practices skills worth 40% of your course grade (Group Presentation 25% + Individual Grade 15%). All team members must actively contribute. Incomplete participation will affect your Participation grade (10% of course).
