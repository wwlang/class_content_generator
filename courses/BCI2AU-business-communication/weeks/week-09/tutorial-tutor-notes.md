# Week 9 Tutorial: Tutor Notes
## Cross-Cultural & Team Communication

---

## Session Timing

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Quick Review | 5 min | Lecture recap + success criteria; emphasize this practices Team Coordination (15% of Group Presentation) |
| Phase 1: Team Coordination Planning | 15 min | Most critical—explicit roles, transitions, timing, support mechanisms |
| Phase 2: Content Preparation | 15 min | Light content focus; coordination matters more than depth |
| Phase 3: Rehearsal | 15 min | Must practice at least twice with adjustments |
| Phase 4: Class Presentations & Feedback | 35 min | Select 3-4 teams; 5 min each + 2-3 min feedback |
| Phase 5: Team Debrief | 10 min | Within teams; apply Three A's framework |

**Total:** 95 minutes (5 min buffer built in)

**If time is short:** Reduce to 3 teams presenting (save 10 min); compress Phase 2 to 12 min.

**If time allows:** Have all teams do rapid 3-minute presentations; extend Phase 5 debrief.

## Learning Objectives Alignment

This tutorial directly prepares students for:

1. **Group Presentation (Week 12) - Team Coordination Component (15%):** Seamless transitions, equal participation, unified team appearance
2. **Individual Grade (Week 12) - 15%:** Each student's speaking quality and team contribution
3. **Comprehensive Quiz (Week 11):** Application of cross-cultural frameworks in team contexts

**Critical Success Factor:** Students must leave today having **practiced actual team coordination mechanics**—not just discussed them theoretically. The physical practice of transitions, timing, and balanced participation is essential.

---

## Key Focus: Team Coordination Rubric Criteria

From Assessment Handbook Section 4 (Group Presentation), Team Coordination is worth 15%:

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Excellent (94-100%)** | Seamless transitions; perfect balance; appears as unified team |
| **Good (84-93%)** | Smooth transitions; good balance; team cohesion evident |
| **Satisfactory (74-83%)** | Adequate transitions; acceptable balance; some coordination |
| **Needs Work (60-73%)** | Awkward transitions; unbalanced; limited coordination |
| **Failing (<60%)** | No transitions; very unbalanced; no coordination |

**Today's Tutorial Goal:** Every team should achieve at least "Good" level in practice by end of session.

## Valid Student Approaches

Students may organize their presentations differently. Do NOT impose one "right" structure. Valid variations include:

### Approach 1: Sequential Topic Progression
- **Structure:** Member A covers Challenge 1, Member B covers Challenge 2, Member C covers Challenge 3, Member D synthesizes solutions
- **Transitions:** "Now that we've seen the power distance challenge, [Name] will explain how uncertainty avoidance creates different issues..."
- **Strength:** Clear logical flow; easy to balance time
- **Watch for:** Can feel disconnected if transitions aren't explicit

### Approach 2: Framework-Based Division
- **Structure:** Member A introduces all challenges, Member B applies Hofstede analysis, Member C applies Meyer's feedback framework, Member D concludes with psychological safety recommendations
- **Transitions:** "Building on [Name's] cultural analysis, I'll show how Meyer's Three A's help navigate these differences..."
- **Strength:** Shows sophisticated framework integration
- **Watch for:** Requires strong conceptual connections between speakers

### Approach 3: Case Study Narrative
- **Structure:** Team tells story of a Vietnamese manager encountering each cultural challenge sequentially, with each member advancing the narrative
- **Transitions:** "[Name] showed how the first meeting went wrong. Let me show what happened next when..."
- **Strength:** Engaging and cohesive
- **Watch for:** Harder to balance speaking time if narrative is uneven

### Approach 4: Problem-Solution Pairs
- **Structure:** Pairs of speakers—one identifies problem, partner presents solution; rotate through 3 problem-solution sets
- **Transitions:** "As [Name] explained, this creates confusion. Here's how we solve it..."
- **Strength:** Built-in coordination between pairs
- **Watch for:** Need to ensure both members of pair have equal time

**Tutor Role:** Validate all approaches. Focus feedback on **execution of transitions and balance**, not the structural choice itself.

## Common Misconceptions to Address

### Misconception 1: "Transitions mean just saying 'next topic' or 'next speaker'"

**Reality:** Excellent transitions **build on previous content** and **preview next content**.

**Bad transition:** "That's all from me. Next is [Name]." [awkward pause]

**Good transition:** "As I've shown, power distance creates hierarchy challenges. Building on this, [Name] will demonstrate how this plays out in daily meeting dynamics."

**Correction:** "Your transition is a bridge connecting two ideas, not just a handoff. Use the previous speaker's key word and your own preview."

### Misconception 2: "Equal participation means everyone introduces themselves"

**Reality:** Equal participation means **equal substantive content**, not just equal number of sentences.

**Bad balance:** Member A: 2 min of analysis; Member B: 2 min of analysis; Member C: 30 sec conclusion; Member D: 30 sec introduction

**Good balance:** 4 members × 52 seconds each = 3.5 min core content + shared intro/conclusion

**Correction:** "Everyone needs roughly equal time presenting core content—not just speaking a few words."

### Misconception 3: "Looking unified means we all dress the same or stand in a line"

**Reality:** Unity comes from **message coordination and mutual support**, not physical uniformity.

**Indicators of unity:**
- Speakers reference each other by name
- Eye contact between members while speaking
- Nodding/active listening when not speaking
- Building on previous points explicitly
- Supporting each other during Q&A

**Correction:** "Unity is about how you connect verbally and non-verbally, not about matching outfits."

### Misconception 4: "This is just practice, so quality doesn't matter"

**Reality:** Practice quality predicts Week 12 performance. Teams that coordinate well today will coordinate well under pressure.

**The stakes:** This practice represents 40% of course grade (25% Group + 15% Individual).

**Correction:** "Treat this like a dress rehearsal—your habits formed today become your Week 12 performance. If you fumble transitions now, you'll fumble them in the graded presentation."

### Misconception 5: "Cultural awareness only matters if we have international students"

**Reality:** Cultural frameworks apply to ALL team diversity—generational, gender, regional, disciplinary.

**Vietnamese context diversity:**
- Northern vs. Southern Vietnamese communication styles differ
- Generation gaps (older students often more hierarchical)
- Gender dynamics (Vietnamese PDI intersects with gender roles)
- Academic backgrounds (business vs. engineering communication norms)

**Correction:** "Even in all-Vietnamese teams, use these frameworks to navigate differences. Plus, 89% of professionals work on global virtual teams—you WILL need these skills."

## Facilitation Guidance

### Phase 1: Team Coordination Planning (15 min) - MOST CRITICAL

**Opening Frame:**

"In Phase 4, I'll select teams to present. If your team hasn't explicitly assigned roles, planned transitions, and balanced timing, you'll fail the coordination component. Be specific—write down your transition sentences word-for-word."

**Circulate and Check For:**

✅ **Explicit role assignment:**
- "Who introduces? Who presents sections 1, 2, 3? Who concludes?"
- Red flag: "We'll just see who feels like talking"

✅ **Written transition sentences:**
- "Show me your planned transition from Member B to Member C"
- Red flag: "We'll just figure it out as we go"

✅ **Time allocation calculated:**
- "You have 4 members and 3.5 minutes of content. How much time per person?"
- Red flag: "However long it takes to say what we need to say"

✅ **Support mechanisms agreed:**
- "What's your signal if someone goes 20 seconds over time?"
- "How will you handle Q&A—one person or tag-team?"

**Sample Strong Coordination Plan:**

```
ROLES:
- Intro: Lan (30 sec)
- Section 1 (Power Distance): Minh (50 sec)
- Section 2 (Uncertainty Avoidance): An (50 sec)
- Section 3 (Solutions): Binh (50 sec)
- Conclusion: Lan (30 sec)

TRANSITIONS:
- Lan → Minh: "As we'll see, power distance is the biggest challenge. Minh will explain why."
- Minh → An: "Minh showed how hierarchy creates confusion. Building on that, I'll demonstrate how Germans' need for structure amplifies this. [turn to An]"
- An → Binh: "We've identified two major challenges. Binh will now present three practical solutions."
- Binh → Lan: "These solutions address both cultural dimensions. Lan will synthesize our key takeaway."

TIME SIGNALS:
- 30 seconds left: Team member in audience taps watch
- Over time: Next speaker gently interjects "Let me build on that point..."

Q&A APPROACH:
- Person asked answers first, then invites team support: "Does anyone want to add?"
```

**Sample Weak Plan:**

```
We'll each talk about one cultural dimension.
We'll just say "next" between people.
Everyone talks for however long.
```

**Intervention Script:**

"That's too vague. You'll fail coordination if you don't plan specifics. Stop what you're doing. Right now, write down: (1) Who presents which section with exact time limits, (2) Your exact transition sentences between each speaker, (3) Your plan if someone goes over time."

### Phase 2: Content Preparation (15 min)

**Key Message to Teams:**

"Content is secondary today—this is a coordination drill, not a research assignment. Simple analysis is fine. Low-fidelity visuals are fine. What matters is smooth teamwork."

**Prevent Over-Preparation:**

If teams are spending too long researching or creating elaborate slides:

"Stop. You're over-preparing content. You have 5 minutes left. Get to basic slides and move to rehearsal. You can deliver a great presentation with flipchart bullets—you CANNOT deliver a great presentation with beautiful slides but terrible transitions."

**Suggested Content Scaffolding:**

If teams struggle with content, provide this structure:

```
SLIDE 1: Title + Team Names
SLIDE 2: 3 Cultural Dimensions (table showing Vietnam vs. [Country] scores)
SLIDE 3: Challenge 1 + Visual example
SLIDE 4: Challenge 2 + Visual example
SLIDE 5: 3 Solutions (bullet points)
SLIDE 6: Key Takeaway
```

**Watch For:**

- Teams debating content accuracy → "Good enough. Move to practice."
- One person doing all visual prep while others watch → "This is collaborative. Everyone contributes."
- Perfectionism → "Low-fidelity. Focus on coordination."

### Phase 3: Rehearsal (15 min) - MAKE IT REAL

**Critical Instruction:**

"You MUST practice your full presentation at least twice. Stand up. Speak at full volume. Use your actual transitions. Time yourselves. No exceptions."

**Circulate and Observe:**

Listen for:
- ✅ Explicit transitions with names and content connections
- ✅ Balanced speaking time (roughly equal)
- ✅ Team members making eye contact with each other
- 🚩 Long pauses between speakers
- 🚩 One person dominating (2+ minutes while others get 30 seconds)
- 🚩 Speakers reading slides instead of connecting to previous speaker

**Intervention Examples:**

**Problem:** Team sitting down, whispering through content

**Intervention:** "Stand up. Speak at presentation volume. Pretend I'm your audience. Start your introduction—go."

**Problem:** Awkward 5-second silence between speakers

**Intervention:** "Stop. That gap kills your coordination score. [Name], your last sentence was about power distance. [Next person], start your section by using those exact words: 'As [Name] explained about power distance...'"

**Problem:** Member A speaks for 90 seconds, Member B speaks for 30 seconds

**Intervention:** "Your time is badly unbalanced. Member A, cut your section in half. Member B, add one more example. Practice again with timers visible."

**Positive Reinforcement:**

When you see excellent practice:

"[Team name], freeze. Everyone watch this team's transition from [Name] to [Name]. See how she used his exact phrase and built on it? That's seamless. Copy that technique."

### Phase 4: Class Presentations & Feedback (35 min)

**Selecting Teams:**

- Aim for 3-4 teams (7-10 min per team including feedback)
- Prioritize diversity: mix of strong/weak coordination observed during rehearsal
- Give 30-second warning: "Team [X], you'll present in 2 minutes. Get ready."

**Time Management:**

- 4 min: Presentation (cut them off if over—this teaches time discipline)
- 1 min: One Q&A question
- 2-3 min: Structured feedback

**Q&A Questions to Ask:**

After each presentation, ask ONE of these:

1. "How would your recommendations change if the company was expanding from Vietnam to [different country]?"
2. "One of your challenges was [X]. Can you give a specific example of how this might play out in a real meeting?"
3. "You recommended [solution]. What's one obstacle to implementing this, and how would you overcome it?"

**Purpose:** Tests knowledge depth AND team's ability to support each other in Q&A.

**Structuring Class Feedback:**

Use this exact format after each presentation:

1. **Tutor models feedback first:** (60 seconds)
   - "One strength: Your transition at [timestamp] was seamless because [specific evidence]"
   - "One improvement: Speaking time was unbalanced—[Name] had 90 seconds, [Name] had 30. Aim for ±15 seconds."

2. **Student feedback:** (60-90 seconds)
   - "Who noticed one specific strength in their coordination? Use evidence."
   - "Who has one actionable suggestion for improvement?"

3. **Brief team response:** (30 seconds)
   - "What's one thing you'd do differently based on this feedback?"

**Sample Tutor Feedback:**

**Strong Coordination Example:**

"Excellent coordination. Your transition from Lan to Minh at 0:45 was textbook—Lan said 'power distance,' Minh started with 'As Lan explained, power distance affects hierarchy,' then built on it. Speaking time was 48, 52, 50, 50 seconds—nearly perfect balance. You appeared unified because you made eye contact with each other while listening. One suggestion: when Binh got the Q&A question, the rest of you froze—practice supporting each other verbally. Solid work."

**Weak Coordination Example:**

"Your content was strong, but coordination needs work. Three issues: (1) Awkward 6-second gap between Minh and An—you need explicit transitions. (2) Speaking time badly unbalanced—An spoke for 2 minutes, Cam spoke for 20 seconds. (3) During Q&A, you contradicted each other. For Week 12, write out your transitions word-for-word, balance your time strictly, and practice Q&A support. You have the knowledge—you need the teamwork."

### Phase 5: Team Debrief (10 min)

**Frame:**

"You've just practiced and received feedback. Now process it as a team using Meyer's Three A's framework. This is your chance to improve BEFORE Week 12."

**Guiding Questions (Write on Board):**

1. What went well in our coordination?
2. Which transition felt most awkward?
3. Did we achieve equal speaking time? (Check recordings/timers)
4. What will we do differently for Week 12?
5. Do we need to adjust our team composition or roles?

**Circulate and Listen For:**

✅ Specific, actionable feedback: "Your transition into my section could use my name—try 'As Binh explained...'"

✅ Application of Three A's:
- Ask First: "May I give you feedback on your speaking pace?"
- Aim to Assist: Genuine intention to help team succeed
- Actionable: Specific improvements, not vague criticism

🚩 Generic feedback: "Good job everyone!"

🚩 Personal attacks: "You always talk too long"

🚩 Defensiveness: "I thought my part was fine"

**Intervention if Teams Struggle:**

"I'm hearing vague feedback. Use Meyer's framework. [Name], ask [Name] permission first: 'May I give you feedback on your transition?' Then make it specific and actionable: 'Try starting with my last keyword.'"

## Vietnamese Cultural Considerations

### High Power Distance (PDI 70) Impact on Tutorial

**Challenge 1: Senior/Older Students Dominating Speaking Time**

**What you'll see:** In mixed-age teams, older students speak for 2 minutes, younger students speak for 20 seconds.

**Why:** Vietnamese PDI = deference to seniority and age

**Intervention:**

"Your speaking time is 90 seconds for [senior student], 30 seconds for [junior student]. That violates equal participation. For Week 12 grading, this costs you points. Rebalance to 60 seconds each. [Junior student], I want to hear you present a full section, not just introduce the team."

**Cultural bridge:** "In Western business presentations, junior employees often present research findings while senior employees field Q&A. Everyone contributes substantively. Practice that norm today."

### Collectivism (IDV 20) Impact on Tutorial

**Challenge 2: Harmony Over Candor in Feedback**

**What you'll see:** Phase 5 debrief consists of "Good job! We did great! No problems!"

**Why:** Vietnamese collectivism = group harmony valued over individual opinions

**Intervention:**

"If you tell each other everything was perfect, you'll make the same mistakes in Week 12. Real teamwork means honest feedback. Everyone must identify ONE thing to improve. I'll start: [Name], your transition at 1:30 had a 4-second gap. That's fixable—write out your transition sentence. Now you give one suggestion to a teammate."

**Cultural bridge:** "In Learning Zone (Edmondson's framework), high accountability requires honest feedback. You can maintain relationship AND give constructive criticism using Meyer's Three A's."

### Indirect Communication (Meyer's Evaluating Dimension)

**Challenge 3: Vague, Face-Saving Feedback**

**What you'll see:** "Maybe we could perhaps consider possibly making the transitions a little bit smoother..." (downgraders piled on)

**Why:** Vietnamese culture = indirect feedback to preserve face

**Intervention:**

"That's too indirect for your team to act on. Be more explicit: 'Our transition from section 1 to section 2 needs work. Let's write out the exact sentence [Name] will say to hand off to [Name].' You can be direct AND respectful."

**Cultural bridge:** "When giving feedback to international teammates or Western managers, increase your directness by 30%. Practice now."

### Communication Apprehension Impact

**Challenge 4: Silent Members During Presentations**

**What you'll see:** One confident member presents 4 minutes, three shy members present 20 seconds total

**Why:** Vietnamese students often have high communication apprehension + face-saving concerns

**Intervention (Private with Team):**

"[Quiet member], you need to present substantive content for Week 12's Individual Grade. Your team's job is to support you. [To team]: How can you make [quiet member] feel safe? Set the Stage (Edmondson)—tell them their input is essential, not optional."

**Coaching Quiet Member:**

"You know the content. Practice your 60-second section with me right now. [Listen.] Good. Do exactly that in the presentation. Your team will support you."

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "We can't practice because we don't have our Week 12 topic finalized"

**Response:**

"Use the scenario provided: Vietnamese company expanding to USA/Japan/Germany. The topic doesn't matter today—we're practicing COORDINATION mechanics. Smooth transitions work with any content. Pick a scenario and go."

### Issue 2: Team member absent—only 2-3 present

**Response:**

"Practice with whoever's here. For Week 12, if someone is absent, the rest of you need to adapt. Show me you can rebalance speaking time on the fly. Absent member loses participation points today."

### Issue 3: Team spends entire Phase 1 debating who should introduce vs. who should conclude

**Response:**

"You've spent 8 minutes debating 60 seconds of content. Make a decision in the next 60 seconds—flip a coin if you have to. The coordination skill isn't choosing roles perfectly, it's executing them smoothly. Move on."

### Issue 4: Team insists their bad transitions are "good enough"

**Response:**

"Watch Team [X's] transition at [timestamp]. That's the standard. Your 5-second awkward silence is not good enough for Week 12. You lose points for that. Practice it again with explicit verbal connection."

### Issue 5: Student says "I'm not good at presenting, so I'll just do the slides"

**Response:**

"Week 12 Individual Grade is 15% of your course grade and requires you to present. There's no 'just do slides' option. You're practicing today so you CAN present well in 3 weeks. Start with 30 seconds today, work up to 60 seconds. Your team will support you."

### Issue 6: International student feels excluded because team conducts planning in Vietnamese

**Response (to team):**

"Switch to English for all planning if even one member speaks English. This is professional courtesy and cross-cultural competence. You're being evaluated on leveraging diversity—excluding someone violates that."

## Timing Flexibility Strategies

### If Running Behind (>10 min)

**Priority 1:** Protect Phase 1 (Team Coordination Planning)—this is non-negotiable
**Priority 2:** Protect Phase 3 (Rehearsal)—must practice twice minimum

**Cut or Compress:**

- **Phase 2 (Content):** Reduce to 10 min; give them template structure
- **Phase 4 (Presentations):** Only 2-3 teams present; give batch feedback to all
- **Phase 5 (Debrief):** Assign as homework; teams document learnings for Moodle

**Emergency Protocol (Running 20+ min behind):**

1. Phase 1: 12 min (compressed)
2. Phase 2: 8 min (give template)
3. Phase 3: 12 min (one full practice + quick fixes)
4. Phase 4: 20 min (2 teams only, 5 min each, batch feedback at end)
5. Phase 5: Skip (assign reflection as homework)

### If Running Ahead (>10 min extra)

**Extend Phase 4:**
- Have all teams present (not just 3-4)
- Increase feedback rounds
- Add peer voting: "Which team had smoothest transitions?"

**Add Advanced Practice:**
- "Now practice handling a hostile Q&A question"
- "Practice recovering when one team member forgets their part"
- "Practice with a strict 4-minute time limit (cut off mid-sentence if needed)"

**Deepen Reflection:**
- Individual reflection: "Write 3 personal commitments for Week 12 coordination"
- Cross-team learning: Teams pair up to exchange feedback

---

## Materials Checklist

**Required Technology:**
- ✅ Projector + timer visible to all teams
- ✅ Internet access for Hofstede tool (backup: printed comparison charts)
- ✅ Recording capability (phone) to time teams during rehearsal

**Required Handouts:**
- ✅ Assessment Handbook Section 4 excerpt (Team Coordination rubric)
- ✅ Transition sentence templates (optional scaffold for weak teams)

**Recommended:**
- Stopwatch or timer for each team
- Flipchart + markers for low-fidelity visuals
- Sample video of excellent team transition (1-minute clip from past semester—anonymized)

---

## Post-Tutorial Actions

**Immediate (Today):**

1. **Note team coordination levels:** Document which teams demonstrated strong vs. weak coordination—this predicts Week 12 performance
2. **Flag at-risk teams:** If any team showed serious dysfunction (conflict, exclusion, massive imbalance), email instructor
3. **Share observation with students:** "I noticed 3 teams had seamless transitions, 2 teams had good balance but awkward handoffs, 1 team needs major coordination work. You know who you are—use the next 3 weeks to improve."

**This Week:**

1. Monitor Week 9 Quiz completion—content directly tests today's frameworks
2. If teams showed severe imbalance (one person dominating), consider private coaching: "I noticed [quiet student] barely spoke. Week 12 individual grade requires substantive participation. Let's strategize."

**Before Week 12:**

1. **Week 10 callback:** "In Week 9 you practiced transitions and balance. Are you applying those lessons to your actual presentation prep?"
2. **Week 11 reminder:** "Your Week 9 coordination practice showed me which teams are ready and which need work. If you struggled then, schedule extra rehearsal time this week."
3. **Use today's observations:** When grading Week 12, reference Week 9 performance—teams that coordinated well in practice tend to coordinate well under pressure

---

## Success Indicators

By end of tutorial, successful teams should demonstrate:

**Minimum (Satisfactory):**
- ✅ Written coordination plan with explicit roles and transitions
- ✅ Presented with all members speaking
- ✅ Attempted to balance speaking time (even if imperfect)
- ✅ Identified 1-2 improvements for Week 12

**Good:**
- ✅ Smooth transitions with explicit verbal connections
- ✅ Speaking time balanced within ±20 seconds
- ✅ Visible mutual support (eye contact, building on points)
- ✅ Constructive feedback exchanged using Three A's

**Excellent:**
- ✅ Seamless transitions with content integration
- ✅ Speaking time balanced within ±10 seconds
- ✅ Unified message throughout; team appears well-rehearsed
- ✅ Sophisticated Q&A handling with team support
- ✅ Specific action plan for Week 12 improvement

**Red Flags (Require Intervention Before Week 12):**
- 🚩 One member presented 80%+ of content
- 🚩 No explicit transitions (awkward silences throughout)
- 🚩 Team conflict during planning (not resolved by end)
- 🚩 Members not making eye contact or supporting each other
- 🚩 Refused to give constructive feedback in Phase 5

## Cultural Bridge: Making Frameworks Accessible

**Key Message Throughout Tutorial:**

"These frameworks—Hofstede, Edmondson, Meyer—are tools used by every successful multinational company. Samsung Vietnam, Intel Vietnam, Microsoft Vietnam all train managers in these frameworks. Learning them now = competitive advantage in job market."

**For Vietnamese Students Specifically:**

"You'll work in environments with:
- Korean managers (Samsung) → high PDI like Vietnam, but higher UAI
- American managers (Intel) → low PDI, high IDV
- European clients (Bosch, Siemens) → varying cultural profiles

Understanding your own Vietnamese cultural programming (high PDI, low IDV, indirect feedback) + ability to adapt = promotable skill."

**For International Students in Vietnamese Context:**

"Vietnam's high power distance means:
- Wait for senior person to speak first in meetings
- Give feedback privately, not publicly
- Use titles (Anh, Chị, Em) showing respect for hierarchy
- Understand that 'yes' might mean 'I hear you' not 'I agree'

Adapting to Vietnamese norms while working here = respect and effectiveness."
