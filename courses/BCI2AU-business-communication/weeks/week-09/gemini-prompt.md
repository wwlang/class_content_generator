# Part 1: Cultural Dimensions in Communication

**Understanding the invisible rules that shape how we communicate**

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions">

## Hofstede's Six Cultural Dimensions

**Most cited cross-cultural framework in business (33,000+ citations)**

1. **Power Distance (PDI):** Acceptance of unequal power distribution
2. **Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV):** Self-image as "I" vs. "We"
3. **Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS):** Achievement vs. relationship orientation
4. **Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI):** Discomfort with ambiguity
5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (LTO):** Future vs. present focus
6. **Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR):** Gratification vs. control

</slide>

<slide number="8" title="Power Distance in Action">

## Power Distance Index (PDI)

**Extent to which less powerful members accept unequal power distribution**

| Low PDI (Egalitarian) | High PDI (Hierarchical) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Denmark (18), Austria (11) | Malaysia (104), Philippines (94) |
| **Vietnam: 70** | United States: 40 |
| Employees expect consultation | Employees expect clear direction |
| Flat organizational structures | Centralized decision-making |
| Calling boss by first name acceptable | Formal titles and hierarchy respected |

**Communication impact:** In high PDI cultures, questioning authority is disrespectful. In low PDI cultures, challenging the boss shows critical thinking.

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Power Distance: Communication Patterns">

## How Power Distance Shapes Communication

**High PDI Communication Patterns (Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines):**
- Information flows top-down through hierarchy
- Decisions made by senior person, communicated to team
- Disagreement expressed privately, indirectly, or not at all
- Formal titles used consistently (Mr., Dr., Manager)
- Junior members wait to be called on before speaking

**Low PDI Communication Patterns (Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands):**
- Information flows freely in all directions
- Decisions made collaboratively with input from all levels
- Disagreement expressed openly in meetings
- First names used regardless of rank
- All members expected to contribute ideas proactively

**Cross-cultural challenge:** Mixed PDI teams must negotiate explicit communication norms or risk misunderstanding silence and initiative.

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Individualism vs. Collectivism">

## Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)

**Whether self-image is defined as "I" or "We"**

| High Individualism | Low Individualism (Collectivist) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| USA (91), Australia (90) | Guatemala (6), South Korea (18) |
| Netherlands (80) | **Vietnam: 20** |
| "I" identity - personal achievement | "We" identity - group harmony |
| Direct confrontation acceptable | Indirect conflict avoidance |
| Personal opinion expected | Group consensus valued |

**Communication impact:** Individualists expect personal credit and direct feedback. Collectivists prioritize group face-saving and indirect criticism.

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Individualism: Conflict and Credit">

## How Individualism Shapes Conflict and Recognition

**Individualist Cultures (USA, Australia, Germany):**
- **Conflict:** "Let's address this issue directly" - confrontation is professional
- **Credit:** "I designed this solution" - claiming personal achievement expected
- **Disagreement:** "I disagree with that approach" - direct opposition acceptable
- **Success metric:** Individual performance reviews, personal bonuses

**Collectivist Cultures (Vietnam, Japan, Thailand):**
- **Conflict:** "Perhaps there's another way to consider this" - indirect suggestion
- **Credit:** "Our team achieved this result" - attributing success to group
- **Disagreement:** Silence or changing subject - preserving harmony
- **Success metric:** Team performance, group recognition

**Cross-cultural challenge:** Individualists may see collectivists as avoiding accountability. Collectivists may see individualists as arrogant and divisive.

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Remaining Four Dimensions">

## Other Cultural Dimensions (Brief Overview)

**3. Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS):**
- High MAS (Japan=95): Achievement, competition, success
- Low MAS (Sweden=5): Cooperation, quality of life, caring
- Vietnam: 40 (moderate)

**4. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI):**
- High UAI (Greece=112): Need for rules and structure
- Low UAI (Singapore=8): Comfortable with ambiguity
- Vietnam: 30 (low - comfortable with flexibility)

**5. Long-Term Orientation (LTO):**
- High LTO (South Korea=100): Future planning, perseverance
- Low LTO (USA=26): Quick results, tradition
- Vietnam: 57 (moderate-high)

**6. Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR):**
- High Indulgence (Mexico=97): Leisure and enjoyment
- High Restraint (Pakistan=0): Strict social norms
- Vietnam: 35 (moderate restraint)

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="Culture is Relative">

## Key Insight: Culture is Relative

**What matters is the DISTANCE between cultures, not absolute scores**

**Example:**
- American manager (PDI=40) working with Danish team (PDI=18)
  - Gap: 22 points - minor adjustment needed
- American manager (PDI=40) working with Malaysian team (PDI=104)
  - Gap: 64 points - major communication challenges likely

**Practical application:** Before international collaboration, compare cultural profiles to identify largest gaps. Focus adaptation energy on the biggest differences.

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Cultural Intelligence in Practice">

## Applying Cultural Intelligence (CQ)

**Cultural Intelligence = Knowledge + Mindfulness + Behavioral Adaptation**

**1. Knowledge:** Learn the cultural dimensions (Hofstede) for countries you work with
**2. Mindfulness:** Observe actual behavior, don't assume stereotypes apply
**3. Behavioral Adaptation:** Adjust your communication style based on the gap

**Example in action:**
- **Knowledge:** My Vietnamese colleague comes from high PDI culture (70)
- **Mindfulness:** But I observe she asks questions freely in meetings - lower PDI behavior
- **Adaptation:** I treat her as an individual, not a stereotype. I ask about her preferences directly

**Key principle:** Hofstede provides the starting hypothesis. Real people provide the data. Always verify.

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Section 2">

# Part 2: Psychological Safety in Teams

**Creating environments where people can take interpersonal risks**

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="framework" title="Psychological Safety Definition">

## What is Psychological Safety?

**"A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking"**
*(Edmondson, 1999)*

**What psychological safety IS:**
- Confidence that speaking up won't be punished
- Willingness to admit mistakes without shame
- Freedom to ask questions without looking ignorant
- Trust that others won't undermine your efforts

**What psychological safety IS NOT:**
- Being nice or avoiding difficult conversations
- Lowering performance standards
- Protecting people from consequences
- Group cohesiveness (cohesive groups can be psychologically unsafe)

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="Measuring Psychological Safety">

## Edmondson's 7-Item Psychological Safety Index

Rate your team (1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree):

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you *(reverse scored)*
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different *(reverse scored)*
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help *(reverse scored)*
6. No one on this team would deliberately act to undermine my efforts
7. Working with this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized

**Scoring:** Reverse items 1, 3, 5, then average all seven. Score >5.5 = high safety; <4.5 = low safety.

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="The Four Zones Framework">

## Psychological Safety × Accountability Matrix

| | **Low Accountability** | **High Accountability** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Psychological Safety** | **Comfort Zone**<br>Safe but complacent<br>Low motivation<br>Minimal innovation | **Learning Zone**<br>**OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE**<br>High engagement<br>Continuous improvement |
| **Low Psychological Safety** | **Apathy Zone**<br>Minimal effort<br>High turnover<br>Disengagement | **Anxiety Zone**<br>Fear-driven work<br>Burnout risk<br>Covering mistakes |

**Goal:** High Safety + High Accountability = Learning Zone

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="Building Psychological Safety">

## Three Leadership Behaviors to Build Psychological Safety

**1. Set the Stage:**
- Frame work as a learning problem, not execution problem
- Acknowledge your own fallibility: "I don't have all the answers"
- Emphasize the need for everyone's voice

**2. Invite Participation:**
- Proactive inquiry: Ask "What are we missing?"
- Create structures for input (anonymous surveys, round-robin sharing)
- Model good listening without defensiveness

**3. Respond Productively:**
- Express appreciation for contributions ("Thank you for raising that")
- Destigmatize failure ("What did we learn from this?")
- Offer help and resources to solve problems

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Psychological Safety Across Cultures">

## How Culture Shapes Psychological Safety

**High Power Distance + Collectivism (Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia):**
- Safety requires explicit permission from authority to speak
- Mistakes are private matters, not public learning moments
- Younger/junior members need active invitation to contribute
- Challenging ideas may feel like challenging people

**Low Power Distance + Individualism (USA, Netherlands, Australia):**
- Safety means freedom to speak without invitation
- Mistakes are shared openly as team learning opportunities
- All members expected to contribute proactively
- Challenging ideas is separate from challenging people

**Implication:** Teams with cultural diversity must explicitly define what "safe" means for their context.

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="section-break" title="Section 3">

# Part 3: Cross-Cultural Feedback

**Adapting your message to your audience's cultural context**

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="framework" title="The Three A's of Feedback">

## Meyer's Three A's Framework for Cross-Cultural Feedback

**1. Aim to Assist:**
- Give feedback ONLY with genuine intention to help
- Never to vent frustration or assert dominance
- Ask: "Will this feedback help them improve?"

**2. Actionable:**
- Include clear actions the recipient can take
- If no action is possible, withhold the feedback
- Vague feedback ("be more professional") doesn't help

**3. Ask First:**
- Request feedback on your own work before giving to others
- Balances power dynamics and models openness
- Especially important across status differences

**Application:** Use all three A's to avoid feedback backfiring

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Case Study: Unsolicited Feedback">

## Case Study: Cassandra and Miles

**Situation:**
Cassandra (software VP) delivers a presentation at a company meeting. Afterward, her colleague Miles sends a detailed email with "tips for improving" her delivery, slide design, and content.

**The problem:**
- Cassandra found the feedback "hijacked her self-confidence"
- She didn't ask for Miles's opinion
- The power imbalance (unrequested advice) felt condescending
- Meyer's research: 90%+ of women report receiving unrequested feedback from male colleagues

**What went wrong:**
Miles violated "Ask First" - he gave feedback without being invited. Even if his tips were useful, the unsolicited nature created resentment.

**Better approach:**
Miles: "I thought your presentation was strong. If you're interested, I have a couple thoughts on slide design from my experience. Would you like to hear them?"
Cassandra now has the power to accept or decline.

</slide>

<slide number="24" title="Upgraders and Downgraders">

## Upgraders vs. Downgraders in Feedback

**Direct Cultures (use UPGRADERS):**
- Germany, Netherlands, Russia, Israel
- Language: "absolutely," "totally," "completely"
- Feedback: "This is completely wrong and needs to be redone"
- Rationale: Clarity prevents misunderstanding

**Indirect Cultures (use DOWNGRADERS):**
- Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam
- Language: "kind of," "a little," "maybe," "perhaps"
- Feedback: "Maybe we could consider adjusting this slightly"
- Rationale: Preserves relationship and face

**Counterintuitive finding:**
Americans are LOW-context (direct communication) but INDIRECT with negative feedback
French are HIGH-context (indirect communication) but DIRECT with criticism

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Case Study: Direct Feedback Clash">

## Case Study: Jethro in Thailand

**Situation:**
Jethro (American VP) gives performance feedback to Thai employee via video call: "Your presentation skills need improvement. You need to make more eye contact and speak more confidently."

**The result:**
Thai HR team accuses Jethro of "bullying." The employee felt personally attacked and humiliated.

**What went wrong:**
- American direct style ("needs improvement") perceived as harsh in Thai indirect culture
- Explicit criticism (even mild by US standards) violates Thai face-saving norms
- Video call made it feel public, increasing embarrassment

**Cultural adaptation:**
Thai indirect approach: "Your presentation was good. Perhaps if you made a bit more eye contact, it could be even stronger." (Praise what's good, gently suggest what could be better)

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="The Feedback Equation">

## Combining the Three A's with Upgraders/Downgraders

**Effective cross-cultural feedback formula:**

1. **Ask First** → Establish permission and mutual exchange
2. **Assess culture** → Determine if recipient expects upgraders or downgraders
3. **Aim to Assist** → Ensure genuine helpful intent
4. **Make it Actionable** → Provide specific, doable next steps
5. **Match directness level** → Use upgraders for direct cultures, downgraders for indirect

**Example - Feedback to Vietnamese teammate:**
❌ **Wrong:** "Your analysis is completely off-base. You need to redo this."
✓ **Right:** "I'd love your feedback on my section first. [After receiving] Thanks! On your analysis, I wonder if we could perhaps consider including customer data to strengthen the argument? Would that be helpful?"

# Part 4: Global Virtual Team Dynamics

**What research tells us about distributed collaboration**

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="framework" title="Personal vs Contextual Diversity">

## Personal vs. Contextual Diversity Framework

| Type | Definition | Examples | Primary Impact |
|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Personal** | Individual demographic characteristics | Age, gender, race, ethnicity | **Psychological outcomes** - Satisfaction, cohesion, turnover |
| **Contextual** | Background and experience | Country, industry, function, education | **Task outcomes** - Quality, creativity, innovation |

**Key Finding:**
Teams with higher contextual diversity produced higher-quality work and more creative solutions. The benefits of diverse backgrounds outweighed the psychological challenges.

**Implication:**
Don't avoid diversity - manage the people-side challenges while leveraging the task-side benefits.

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Cultural Dimensions That Matter Most">

## Which Cultural Dimensions Most Impact Virtual Team Performance?

**Taras et al. (2021) findings from 804 global virtual teams:**

**Most Important Positive Factors:**
1. **Gender Egalitarianism:** Cultures that value equal rights and opportunities for all genders produce more effective virtual teams
2. **Low Power Distance:** Flat hierarchies enable better virtual collaboration than strict hierarchies

**Why these matter:**
- Virtual communication removes visual status cues (office size, clothing, body language)
- Text-based communication (email, Slack) is inherently egalitarian
- High Power Distance cultures struggle when hierarchy is invisible in virtual contexts

**Implication:**
Virtual teams should explicitly negotiate communication norms, especially around hierarchy and participation equality.

</slide>

<slide number="30" title="Managing Global Virtual Teams">

## Practical Strategies for Global Virtual Teams

**From Taras et al. (2021) research:**

**1. Leverage Contextual Diversity:**
- Assign tasks that benefit from different perspectives
- Actively seek input from members with different functional backgrounds
- Value country-specific knowledge as expertise

**2. Proactively Manage Personal Diversity:**
- Build informal connection time (not just task focus)
- Rotate meeting times to share time zone burden
- Establish explicit communication norms in writing

**3. Create Positive Team Climate:**
- Psychological safety practices from Edmondson
- Cross-cultural feedback using Meyer's Three A's
- Regular check-ins on team dynamics, not just task progress

</slide>

<slide number="31" title="Virtual Team Success Factors">

## Research-Validated Success Factors for Virtual Teams

**Taras et al. (2021) identified these factors correlate with higher performance:**

**Communication practices:**
- Regular synchronous meetings (video > audio > text)
- Established response time expectations
- Multiple communication channels for different purposes
- Explicit norms about when to use which channel

**Relationship building:**
- Initial face-to-face meeting if possible (or extended video kickoff)
- Informal social time built into meetings
- Celebration of milestones and wins
- Recognition of individual contributions

**Conflict management:**
- Early intervention when tensions emerge
- Distinguish task conflict (healthy) from relationship conflict (destructive)
- Use structured processes for difficult conversations
- Leverage cultural differences as asset, not obstacle

# Synthesis & Takeaways

**Bringing the frameworks together**

</slide>

<slide number="33" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

**1. Culture is relative:**
What matters is the DISTANCE between cultures, not absolute scores. Adapt based on the gap between you and your communication partner.

**2. Psychological safety enables performance:**
High Safety + High Accountability = Learning Zone. Teams that feel safe to take risks outperform teams that don't, regardless of talent.

**3. Adapt feedback to culture:**
Use Meyer's Three A's (Aim to Assist, Actionable, Ask First) and match upgrader/downgrader style to your recipient's culture.

**4. Leverage diversity as strength:**
Contextual diversity improves outcomes if you manage personal diversity challenges through explicit norms and psychological safety.

</slide>

<slide number="34" title="Assessment Preview">

## Group Presentation (Week 12)

**How today's frameworks help your team succeed:**

✓ **Hofstede's dimensions:** Identify cultural gaps in your team, adapt communication styles
✓ **Psychological safety:** Create climate where all members contribute ideas without fear
✓ **Three A's feedback:** Give each other helpful criticism without damaging relationships
✓ **Diversity leverage:** Use different backgrounds as strength, not obstacle

**Between now and Week 12:**
