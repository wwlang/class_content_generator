## Questions

### Q1: Hofstede's Six Cultural Dimensions
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

What are the six cultural dimensions in Hofstede's framework?

A) Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, Indulgence
B) Power Distance, Collectivism, Femininity, Risk Avoidance, Short-Term Orientation, Restraint
C) Hierarchy, Independence, Achievement, Certainty, Future Focus, Freedom
D) Authority, Identity, Values, Structure, Adaptation, Gratification

**Answer:** A

**Feedback:**
- **A) Correct!** Hofstede's six dimensions are: Power Distance (PDI), Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV), Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI), Long-Term Orientation (LTO), and Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR). These dimensions emerged from research with 117,000+ IBM employees across 76 countries and help explain systematic differences in how cultures approach hierarchy, identity, values, ambiguity, time, and gratification.
- **B) Incorrect.** While these capture the opposite ends of some dimensions, Hofstede uses specific terminology. The dimensions are named for one end of the scale (e.g., "Individualism" not "Collectivism" as the dimension name), and the actual terms are Power Distance, Masculinity (not Femininity), Uncertainty Avoidance (not Risk Avoidance), Long-Term Orientation (not Short-Term), and Indulgence (not Restraint).
- **C) Incorrect.** These are conceptual paraphrases but not the official dimension names from Hofstede's framework. Using standardized terminology is important for comparing cultures across the research literature and using tools like hofstede-insights.com.
- **D) Incorrect.** These terms capture some underlying concepts but aren't Hofstede's dimension names. Authority relates to Power Distance, and Identity relates to Individualism, but the framework uses specific labels that are standard across cross-cultural business research.

### Q2: Psychological Safety Definition
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Amy Edmondson (1999), what is psychological safety?

A) A team climate where members trust each other to keep commitments
B) A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking
C) A leadership style that avoids giving negative feedback
D) A team norm where everyone is nice and avoids disagreement

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This describes trust, not psychological safety. Edmondson explicitly distinguishes psychological safety from trust—trust is about expectations regarding others' future actions ("I believe you'll keep your word"), while safety is about the team climate being open to candor. You can have high trust but low psychological safety if the team punishes speaking up.
- **B) Correct!** Edmondson defines psychological safety as "a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking." This means people feel comfortable asking questions, admitting mistakes, challenging the status quo, and offering wild ideas without fear of punishment, humiliation, or negative consequences to their status or career. It's about the overall team climate, not individual relationships.
- **C) Incorrect.** Psychological safety is not the same as "being nice" or avoiding critical feedback. In fact, high psychological safety enables the candid, direct feedback that niceness often avoids. Safety means you can give and receive honest feedback without fear—it's about creating conditions for productive disagreement, not eliminating disagreement.
- **D) Incorrect.** Group cohesiveness (everyone being nice, getting along) can actually reduce psychological safety because cohesive teams sometimes avoid challenging each other to preserve harmony (groupthink). Psychological safety requires comfort with disagreement and debate—it's about enabling voice, not enforcing niceness.

### Q3: Vietnam's Power Distance Score
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

What is Vietnam's score on Hofstede's Power Distance dimension, and what does this indicate?

A) 20 (Low) – Hierarchy exists for convenience; flat organizational structures
B) 40 (Moderate) – Balance between hierarchy and equality
C) 70 (High) – Hierarchical society; managers expect obedience
D) 91 (Very High) – Extreme hierarchy; junior members never question seniors

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** A score of 20 represents LOW power distance (like Denmark at 18), where hierarchy is minimal and all team members feel comfortable challenging authority. Vietnam's actual score is 70, indicating HIGH power distance where hierarchy is respected and expected.
- **B) Incorrect.** Vietnam doesn't fall in the moderate range on this dimension. With a score of 70, Vietnam has HIGH power distance, meaning hierarchical relationships are deeply embedded—managers lead decisively, subordinates show respect, and indirect disagreement preserves harmony.
- **C) Correct!** Vietnam scores 70 on Power Distance, which is HIGH. This means Vietnamese culture accepts and expects hierarchical relationships where power is distributed unequally. In practice: managers expect to be obeyed, junior staff wait for senior approval before acting, speaking order respects seniority, and challenging authority directly would be seen as disrespectful. This affects communication through indirect disagreement and emphasis on face-saving.
- **D) Incorrect.** While 91 would represent extremely high power distance (like some Middle Eastern countries), Vietnam's score is 70—high but not extreme. The score of 70 does indicate strong respect for hierarchy, but Vietnamese culture also has moderate uncertainty avoidance (30), meaning some flexibility exists within hierarchical structures.

### Q4: Meyer's Three A's of Feedback
**Type:** Matching
**Category:** Remembering

Match each of Meyer's Three A's to its definition:

**Principles:**
1. Aim to Assist
2. Actionable
3. Ask First

**Definitions:**
A) Feedback must include clear actions the recipient can take
B) Give feedback only with genuine intention to help, never to vent or assert dominance
C) Request feedback on your own work before giving feedback to others

**Answers:**
1 → B
2 → A
3 → C

**Feedback:**
- **If all correct:** Perfect! Meyer's Three A's provide a framework for effective cross-cultural feedback: (1) Aim to Assist means checking your motivation—feedback should help the recipient, not serve your ego; (2) Actionable means including specific steps they can take (vague criticism helps no one); (3) Ask First means requesting feedback reciprocally before giving it, which balances power dynamics and creates a feedback culture. Following all three prevents 90% of cross-cultural feedback disasters.
- **If incorrect:** Review the Three A's from the lecture. The Golden Rule Revised: "Do unto others as THEY would have done unto themselves"—not as you would want it. All three principles work together: good intent (Aim to Assist) + specific guidance (Actionable) + respectful process (Ask First) = effective feedback across cultures. Remember Cassandra's case: Miles violated "Ask First" by sending unrequested presentation tips.

### Q5: The Four Zones Framework
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In Edmondson's Four Zones framework, which zone represents HIGH psychological safety and HIGH accountability?

A) Comfort Zone
B) Learning Zone
C) Anxiety Zone
D) Apathy Zone

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The Comfort Zone has HIGH psychological safety but LOW accountability—teams are safe and comfortable, but there's no pressure to perform. This results in complacency with no growth. Common in student projects where everyone is friends but nobody pushes for excellence.
- **B) Correct!** The Learning Zone combines HIGH psychological safety + HIGH accountability, which is the optimal state for team performance. People can challenge each other's ideas (safety enables candor) AND everyone delivers on commitments (accountability drives execution). This is your goal for group presentations—create conditions where team members feel safe speaking up while also holding each other to high standards.
- **C) Incorrect.** The Anxiety Zone has LOW psychological safety but HIGH accountability—there are high standards but people fear speaking up. This leads to fear-driven work, burnout, and organizational politics. Common in high-pressure corporate cultures where mistakes are punished. Vietnamese teams sometimes start here due to high power distance creating fear of challenging seniors.
- **D) Incorrect.** The Apathy Zone has LOW psychological safety and LOW accountability—nobody cares about quality or climate. This is the worst outcome, characterized by minimal effort and "why bother?" attitudes. Teams reach this state when there are neither standards nor safety to improve them.

### Q6: Upgraders vs. Downgraders Language
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

True or False: Vietnamese business culture typically uses "downgrader" language (kind of, maybe, sort of) when giving negative feedback to maintain harmony and preserve face.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **True (Correct):** Yes! Vietnamese culture, like other high-context Asian cultures (Thailand, Japan, Indonesia), uses downgrader language to soften criticism. The philosophy is "say the good, leave out the bad" or use hedging words to preserve relationships and prevent loss of face—both critical values in collectivist, high power distance cultures. Meyer positions Vietnam at the most indirect end (position 7) on the Evaluating dimension. When working with more direct cultures (USA, Australia, Germany), Vietnamese professionals need to adapt by being more explicit.
- **False (Incorrect):** Actually, Vietnamese culture does use downgraders, not upgraders. Upgrader cultures (Germany, Netherlands, Russia, Israel) use intensifying language like "absolutely," "totally," "completely wrong" because they view directness as professional and respectful. Vietnamese speakers soften criticism because maintaining harmony and face-saving takes priority over blunt clarity. This is why the same feedback can feel helpful to Germans but devastating to Vietnamese recipients.

### Q7: Contextual vs. Personal Diversity
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to Taras et al. (2021), what is the PRIMARY impact of contextual diversity (different educational backgrounds, industries, countries) on team performance?

A) It primarily affects psychological outcomes like satisfaction and cohesion
B) It primarily improves task outcomes like quality and creativity
C) It primarily increases conflict and requires active management
D) It primarily reduces team efficiency due to communication barriers

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This describes the impact of PERSONAL diversity (age, gender, race, personality), not contextual diversity. Personal diversity primarily affects psychological outcomes—team climate, satisfaction, trust—and requires active management to prevent negative effects. Contextual diversity works differently.
- **B) Correct!** Taras et al.'s research with 5,728 individuals in 804 teams across 90 countries found that "teams with higher contextual diversity produced higher-quality consulting reports, and their solutions were more creative and innovative." Contextual diversity (different educational backgrounds, functional expertise, industries, countries) improves task outcomes because diverse perspectives identify blind spots and generate better solutions. This is your competitive advantage in group projects—leverage different majors, work experiences, and international exposure.
- **C) Incorrect.** While contextual diversity can create communication challenges, the research shows its primary impact is POSITIVE—improved work quality and innovation. The benefits typically outweigh coordination costs. It's personal diversity that more often requires active management due to trust and cohesion challenges.
- **D) Incorrect.** The opposite is true—contextual diversity improves outcomes. While there may be initial coordination costs (different vocabularies, work styles), teams that leverage contextual diversity produce higher-quality, more creative solutions. The key is managing the process through psychological safety and explicit team norms.

### Q8: Gender Egalitarianism and Power Distance
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

Why are Gender Egalitarianism (high) and Absence of Power Distance (low PDI) the two most important cultural factors for positive team outcomes?

A) Because they are the easiest cultural dimensions to measure objectively
B) Because they both enable psychological safety, the #1 predictor of team effectiveness
C) Because they reduce contextual diversity, making teams more homogeneous
D) Because they eliminate the need for explicit team communication protocols

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While measurement validity matters for research, that's not why these dimensions predict team success. The reason is functional—both dimensions create conditions where team members feel safe speaking up: gender egalitarianism ensures equal voice regardless of gender, and low power distance ensures junior members can challenge seniors. This psychological safety drives performance.
- **B) Correct!** Both Gender Egalitarianism and low Power Distance enable psychological safety—the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. When everyone's ideas are valued equally (regardless of gender) and hierarchy is flat (junior members can challenge seniors), people feel comfortable asking questions, admitting mistakes, and offering creative ideas. Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the #1 factor distinguishing high-performing teams. These two dimensions create the conditions for that safety.
- **C) Incorrect.** These dimensions don't reduce diversity—they manage how teams work WITH diversity. In fact, they help teams leverage contextual diversity (different backgrounds) by ensuring all perspectives are heard. High power distance and low gender egalitarianism SUPPRESS diverse voices; low PDI and high gender egalitarianism ENABLE them.
- **D) Incorrect.** Even teams from egalitarian, low-PDI cultures benefit from explicit team protocols. These cultural factors create favorable baseline conditions, but teams still need to actively establish norms, invite participation, and respond productively to build psychological safety. Vietnamese teams face structural challenges (high PDI culture) but can create low-PDI environments within their project teams through explicit protocols.

### Q9: Edmondson's Set the Stage Principle
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

True or False: According to Edmondson's "Set the Stage" principle, leaders should acknowledge their own fallibility and frame work as a learning problem rather than an execution problem.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **True (Correct):** Exactly! "Set the Stage" is the first of Edmondson's three leadership practices for building psychological safety. Leaders should explicitly frame work as a learning problem ("We're navigating uncertain territory and I need everyone's input") rather than an execution problem ("I have the answer, just do what I say"). Acknowledging fallibility ("I don't have all the answers") gives permission for others to speak up, ask questions, and challenge ideas. This is especially important in high power distance cultures like Vietnam, where extra emphasis on "Set the Stage" helps overcome cultural norms that discourage questioning authority.
- **False (Incorrect):** Actually, acknowledging fallibility is central to "Set the Stage." When leaders admit they don't have all answers, it signals that the team needs everyone's input and that speaking up is expected, not just tolerated. This is counterintuitive for Vietnamese students from high PDI backgrounds, where leaders are expected to have answers, but research shows it's critical for creating the Learning Zone (high safety + high accountability) needed for optimal team performance.

### Q10: Direct vs. Indirect Feedback Cultures
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Meyer's Culture Map, where does Vietnam fall on the scale of direct vs. indirect negative feedback?

A) Position 1-2: Most direct (like Germany, Netherlands)
B) Position 3-4: Moderately direct (like USA, Australia)
C) Position 5-6: Moderately indirect (like Brazil, India)
D) Position 7: Most indirect (like Thailand, Japan, Vietnam)

**Answer:** D

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Germany and Netherlands are at the MOST DIRECT end of Meyer's scale—they use upgrader language ("absolutely," "completely wrong") and state criticism plainly because they view directness as professional. Vietnam is at the opposite end of this spectrum.
- **B) Incorrect.** USA and Australia fall in the middle-to-moderately-direct range (position 4). They're more direct than Vietnam but much less direct than Germany. Interestingly, Americans are LOW-context communicators but INDIRECT with negative feedback—they use the "sandwich method" (positive-negative-positive).
- **C) Incorrect.** Brazil, Mexico, and India are moderately indirect but not at the extreme end. They fall around position 6. Vietnam, along with Thailand and Japan, clusters at the MOST indirect end (position 7) due to high-context communication, collectivism, and emphasis on face-saving.
- **D) Correct!** Meyer positions Vietnam at position 7—the most indirect end of the Evaluating dimension, alongside Thailand and Japan. Vietnamese culture uses "say the good, leave out the bad" or heavy downgrader language to preserve harmony and prevent loss of face. When working with Western colleagues (positions 1-5), Vietnamese professionals need to adapt by being more explicit: add clarity, state concerns directly (but respectfully), and don't assume indirectness will be understood.
