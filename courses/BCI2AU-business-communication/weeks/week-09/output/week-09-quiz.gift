// ==================== REMEMBERING QUESTIONS ====================

// Q1: Hofstede's Six Cultural Dimensions (MC - Remembering)
::W9-Q1-Hofstede-Six-Dimensions::What are the six cultural dimensions in Hofstede's framework?{
=Hofstede's six dimensions are\: Power Distance (PDI), Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV), Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI), Long-Term Orientation (LTO), and Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR). These dimensions emerged from research with 117,000+ IBM employees across 76 countries and help explain systematic differences in how cultures approach hierarchy, identity, values, ambiguity, time, and gratification.#Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, Indulgence
~While these capture the opposite ends of some dimensions, Hofstede uses specific terminology. The dimensions are named for one end of the scale (e.g., "Individualism" not "Collectivism" as the dimension name), and the actual terms are Power Distance, Masculinity (not Femininity), Uncertainty Avoidance (not Risk Avoidance), Long-Term Orientation (not Short-Term), and Indulgence (not Restraint).#Power Distance, Collectivism, Femininity, Risk Avoidance, Short-Term Orientation, Restraint
~These are conceptual paraphrases but not the official dimension names from Hofstede's framework. Using standardized terminology is important for comparing cultures across the research literature and using tools like hofstede-insights.com.#Hierarchy, Independence, Achievement, Certainty, Future Focus, Freedom
~These terms capture some underlying concepts but aren't Hofstede's dimension names. Authority relates to Power Distance, and Identity relates to Individualism, but the framework uses specific labels that are standard across cross-cultural business research.#Authority, Identity, Values, Structure, Adaptation, Gratification
}

// Q2: Psychological Safety Definition (MC - Remembering)
::W9-Q2-Psychological-Safety-Definition::According to Amy Edmondson (1999), what is psychological safety?{
~This describes trust, not psychological safety. Edmondson explicitly distinguishes psychological safety from trust—trust is about expectations regarding others' future actions ("I believe you'll keep your word"), while safety is about the team climate being open to candor. You can have high trust but low psychological safety if the team punishes speaking up.#A team climate where members trust each other to keep commitments
=Edmondson defines psychological safety as "a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking." This means people feel comfortable asking questions, admitting mistakes, challenging the status quo, and offering wild ideas without fear of punishment, humiliation, or negative consequences to their status or career. It's about the overall team climate, not individual relationships.#A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking
~Psychological safety is not the same as "being nice" or avoiding critical feedback. In fact, high psychological safety enables the candid, direct feedback that niceness often avoids. Safety means you can give and receive honest feedback without fear—it's about creating conditions for productive disagreement, not eliminating disagreement.#A leadership style that avoids giving negative feedback
~Group cohesiveness (everyone being nice, getting along) can actually reduce psychological safety because cohesive teams sometimes avoid challenging each other to preserve harmony (groupthink). Psychological safety requires comfort with disagreement and debate—it's about enabling voice, not enforcing niceness.#A team norm where everyone is nice and avoids disagreement
}

// Q3: Vietnam's Power Distance Score (MC - Remembering)
::W9-Q3-Vietnam-Power-Distance-Score::What is Vietnam's score on Hofstede's Power Distance dimension, and what does this indicate?{
~A score of 20 represents LOW power distance (like Denmark at 18), where hierarchy is minimal and all team members feel comfortable challenging authority. Vietnam's actual score is 70, indicating HIGH power distance where hierarchy is respected and expected.#20 (Low) – Hierarchy exists for convenience; flat organizational structures
~Vietnam doesn't fall in the moderate range on this dimension. With a score of 70, Vietnam has HIGH power distance, meaning hierarchical relationships are deeply embedded—managers lead decisively, subordinates show respect, and indirect disagreement preserves harmony.#40 (Moderate) – Balance between hierarchy and equality
=Vietnam scores 70 on Power Distance, which is HIGH. This means Vietnamese culture accepts and expects hierarchical relationships where power is distributed unequally. In practice\: managers expect to be obeyed, junior staff wait for senior approval before acting, speaking order respects seniority, and challenging authority directly would be seen as disrespectful. This affects communication through indirect disagreement and emphasis on face-saving.#70 (High) – Hierarchical society; managers expect obedience
~While 91 would represent extremely high power distance (like some Middle Eastern countries), Vietnam's score is 70—high but not extreme. The score of 70 does indicate strong respect for hierarchy, but Vietnamese culture also has moderate uncertainty avoidance (30), meaning some flexibility exists within hierarchical structures.#91 (Very High) – Extreme hierarchy; junior members never question seniors

// Q4: Meyer's Three A's of Feedback (Matching - Remembering)
::W9-Q4-Three-As-Matching::Match each of Meyer's Three A's to its definition\:
1. Aim to Assist
2. Actionable
3. Ask First

A) Feedback must include clear actions the recipient can take
B) Give feedback only with genuine intention to help, never to vent or assert dominance
C) Request feedback on your own work before giving feedback to others
{
=1-B, 2-A, 3-C#Perfect! Meyer's Three A's provide a framework for effective cross-cultural feedback\: (1) Aim to Assist means checking your motivation—feedback should help the recipient, not serve your ego; (2) Actionable means including specific steps they can take (vague criticism helps no one); (3) Ask First means requesting feedback reciprocally before giving it, which balances power dynamics and creates a feedback culture. Following all three prevents 90% of cross-cultural feedback disasters.
~Review the Three A's from the lecture. The Golden Rule Revised\: "Do unto others as THEY would have done unto themselves"—not as you would want it. All three principles work together\: good intent (Aim to Assist) + specific guidance (Actionable) + respectful process (Ask First) \= effective feedback across cultures. Remember Cassandra's case\: Miles violated "Ask First" by sending unrequested presentation tips.#Any other combination
}

// Q5: The Four Zones Framework (MC - Remembering)
::W9-Q5-Four-Zones-Learning-Zone::In Edmondson's Four Zones framework, which zone represents HIGH psychological safety and HIGH accountability?{
~The Comfort Zone has HIGH psychological safety but LOW accountability—teams are safe and comfortable, but there's no pressure to perform. This results in complacency with no growth. Common in student projects where everyone is friends but nobody pushes for excellence.#Comfort Zone
=The Learning Zone combines HIGH psychological safety + HIGH accountability, which is the optimal state for team performance. People can challenge each other's ideas (safety enables candor) AND everyone delivers on commitments (accountability drives execution). This is your goal for group presentations—create conditions where team members feel safe speaking up while also holding each other to high standards.#Learning Zone
~The Anxiety Zone has LOW psychological safety but HIGH accountability—there are high standards but people fear speaking up. This leads to fear-driven work, burnout, and organizational politics. Common in high-pressure corporate cultures where mistakes are punished. Vietnamese teams sometimes start here due to high power distance creating fear of challenging seniors.#Anxiety Zone
~The Apathy Zone has LOW psychological safety and LOW accountability—nobody cares about quality or climate. This is the worst outcome, characterized by minimal effort and "why bother?" attitudes. Teams reach this state when there are neither standards nor safety to improve them.#Apathy Zone

// ==================== UNDERSTANDING QUESTIONS ====================

// Q6: Upgraders vs. Downgraders Language (T/F - Understanding)
::W9-Q6-Upgraders-Downgraders-TF::Vietnamese business culture typically uses "downgrader" language (kind of, maybe, sort of) when giving negative feedback to maintain harmony and preserve face.{
TRUE#Yes! Vietnamese culture, like other high-context Asian cultures (Thailand, Japan, Indonesia), uses downgrader language to soften criticism. The philosophy is "say the good, leave out the bad" or use hedging words to preserve relationships and prevent loss of face—both critical values in collectivist, high power distance cultures. Meyer positions Vietnam at the most indirect end (position 7) on the Evaluating dimension. When working with more direct cultures (USA, Australia, Germany), Vietnamese professionals need to adapt by being more explicit.#Actually, Vietnamese culture does use downgraders, not upgraders. Upgrader cultures (Germany, Netherlands, Russia, Israel) use intensifying language like "absolutely," "totally," "completely wrong" because they view directness as professional and respectful. Vietnamese speakers soften criticism because maintaining harmony and face-saving takes priority over blunt clarity. This is why the same feedback can feel helpful to Germans but devastating to Vietnamese recipients.

// Q7: Contextual vs. Personal Diversity (MC - Understanding)
::W9-Q7-Contextual-Diversity-Impact::According to Taras et al. (2021), what is the PRIMARY impact of contextual diversity (different educational backgrounds, industries, countries) on team performance?{
~This describes the impact of PERSONAL diversity (age, gender, race, personality), not contextual diversity. Personal diversity primarily affects psychological outcomes—team climate, satisfaction, trust—and requires active management to prevent negative effects. Contextual diversity works differently.#It primarily affects psychological outcomes like satisfaction and cohesion
=Taras et al.'s research with 5,728 individuals in 804 teams across 90 countries found that "teams with higher contextual diversity produced higher-quality consulting reports, and their solutions were more creative and innovative." Contextual diversity (different educational backgrounds, functional expertise, industries, countries) improves task outcomes because diverse perspectives identify blind spots and generate better solutions. This is your competitive advantage in group projects—leverage different majors, work experiences, and international exposure.#It primarily improves task outcomes like quality and creativity
~While contextual diversity can create communication challenges, the research shows its primary impact is POSITIVE—improved work quality and innovation. The benefits typically outweigh coordination costs. It's personal diversity that more often requires active management due to trust and cohesion challenges.#It primarily increases conflict and requires active management
~The opposite is true—contextual diversity improves outcomes. While there may be initial coordination costs (different vocabularies, work styles), teams that leverage contextual diversity produce higher-quality, more creative solutions. The key is managing the process through psychological safety and explicit team norms.#It primarily reduces team efficiency due to communication barriers
}

// Q8: Gender Egalitarianism and Power Distance (MC - Understanding)
::W9-Q8-Gender-PDI-Psychological-Safety::Why are Gender Egalitarianism (high) and Absence of Power Distance (low PDI) the two most important cultural factors for positive team outcomes?{
~While measurement validity matters for research, that's not why these dimensions predict team success. The reason is functional—both dimensions create conditions where team members feel safe speaking up\: gender egalitarianism ensures equal voice regardless of gender, and low power distance ensures junior members can challenge seniors. This psychological safety drives performance.#Because they are the easiest cultural dimensions to measure objectively
=Both Gender Egalitarianism and low Power Distance enable psychological safety—the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. When everyone's ideas are valued equally (regardless of gender) and hierarchy is flat (junior members can challenge seniors), people feel comfortable asking questions, admitting mistakes, and offering creative ideas. Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the \#1 factor distinguishing high-performing teams. These two dimensions create the conditions for that safety.#Because they both enable psychological safety, the \#1 predictor of team effectiveness
~These dimensions don't reduce diversity—they manage how teams work WITH diversity. In fact, they help teams leverage contextual diversity (different backgrounds) by ensuring all perspectives are heard. High power distance and low gender egalitarianism SUPPRESS diverse voices; low PDI and high gender egalitarianism ENABLE them.#Because they reduce contextual diversity, making teams more homogeneous
~Even teams from egalitarian, low-PDI cultures benefit from explicit team protocols. These cultural factors create favorable baseline conditions, but teams still need to actively establish norms, invite participation, and respond productively to build psychological safety. Vietnamese teams face structural challenges (high PDI culture) but can create low-PDI environments within their project teams through explicit protocols.#Because they eliminate the need for explicit team communication protocols
}

// Q9: Edmondson's Set the Stage Principle (T/F - Understanding)
::W9-Q9-Set-Stage-Fallibility-TF::According to Edmondson's "Set the Stage" principle, leaders should acknowledge their own fallibility and frame work as a learning problem rather than an execution problem.{
TRUE#Exactly! "Set the Stage" is the first of Edmondson's three leadership practices for building psychological safety. Leaders should explicitly frame work as a learning problem ("We're navigating uncertain territory and I need everyone's input") rather than an execution problem ("I have the answer, just do what I say"). Acknowledging fallibility ("I don't have all the answers") gives permission for others to speak up, ask questions, and challenge ideas. This is especially important in high power distance cultures like Vietnam, where extra emphasis on "Set the Stage" helps overcome cultural norms that discourage questioning authority.#Actually, acknowledging fallibility is central to "Set the Stage." When leaders admit they don't have all answers, it signals that the team needs everyone's input and that speaking up is expected, not just tolerated. This is counterintuitive for Vietnamese students from high PDI backgrounds, where leaders are expected to have answers, but research shows it's critical for creating the Learning Zone (high safety + high accountability) needed for optimal team performance.

// Q10: Direct vs. Indirect Feedback Cultures (MC - Remembering)
::W9-Q10-Vietnam-Culture-Map-Position::According to Meyer's Culture Map, where does Vietnam fall on the scale of direct vs. indirect negative feedback?{
~Germany and Netherlands are at the MOST DIRECT end of Meyer's scale—they use upgrader language ("absolutely," "completely wrong") and state criticism plainly because they view directness as professional. Vietnam is at the opposite end of this spectrum.#Position 1-2\: Most direct (like Germany, Netherlands)
~USA and Australia fall in the middle-to-moderately-direct range (position 4). They're more direct than Vietnam but much less direct than Germany. Interestingly, Americans are LOW-context communicators but INDIRECT with negative feedback—they use the "sandwich method" (positive-negative-positive).#Position 3-4\: Moderately direct (like USA, Australia)
~Brazil, Mexico, and India are moderately indirect but not at the extreme end. They fall around position 6. Vietnam, along with Thailand and Japan, clusters at the MOST indirect end (position 7) due to high-context communication, collectivism, and emphasis on face-saving.#Position 5-6\: Moderately indirect (like Brazil, India)
=Meyer positions Vietnam at position 7—the most indirect end of the Evaluating dimension, alongside Thailand and Japan. Vietnamese culture uses "say the good, leave out the bad" or heavy downgrader language to preserve harmony and prevent loss of face. When working with Western colleagues (positions 1-5), Vietnamese professionals need to adapt by being more explicit\: add clarity, state concerns directly (but respectfully), and don't assume indirectness will be understood.#Position 7\: Most indirect (like Thailand, Japan, Vietnam)
