$CATEGORY: Week 9: Cross-Cultural & Team Communication

::Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions::What are the six dimensions in Hofstede's cultural framework?
{
=Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, Indulgence
~Communication, Leadership, Teamwork, Ethics, Innovation, Quality
~Trust, Safety, Accountability, Diversity, Feedback, Collaboration
~Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling, Evaluating, Adapting
####Hofstede's six cultural dimensions\: (1) Power Distance—acceptance of unequal power distribution; (2) Individualism vs. Collectivism—degree of group integration; (3) Masculinity vs. Femininity—achievement versus caring values; (4) Uncertainty Avoidance—tolerance for ambiguity; (5) Long-Term Orientation—future versus past/present focus; (6) Indulgence vs. Restraint—freedom to enjoy life. These <b>systematically</b> (in a regular, organized way across all cases) explain differences in how cultures approach communication, decision-making, and team dynamics. Each dimension operates as a <b>sliding scale</b> (a range from one extreme to another, not a binary choice). See Week 9 slides 5-9.}

::Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions::How do high and low power distance cultures differ in their relationship with authority?
{
=High PDI accepts hierarchical authority and expects obedience; Low PDI questions authority and prefers equality
~High PDI values individual achievement; Low PDI values group harmony
~High PDI avoids uncertainty; Low PDI embraces it
~High PDI focuses on tradition; Low PDI focuses on the future
####Power Distance (PDI) measures acceptance of unequal power distribution. High PDI cultures (e.g., Vietnam 70, Thailand 64) accept <b>centralized</b> (concentrated at top levels) authority, formal hierarchy, and respect for seniority. Managers expect obedience; subordinates don't challenge decisions. Low PDI cultures (e.g., Denmark 18, Australia 40) question authority, prefer flat structures, and expect <b>consultation</b> (asking for opinions before deciding). Both approaches are <b>legitimate</b> (valid, justified, acceptable). Affects communication style, decision-making, feedback approaches, and team dynamics. See Week 9 slides 6-10.}

::Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions::What is the key difference between Vietnam (Individualism score 20) and the USA (Individualism score 91) on Hofstede's Individualism dimension?
{
=Vietnam prioritizes group identity and harmony; USA prioritizes individual identity and autonomy
~Vietnam values achievement while USA values relationships
~Vietnam is more structured while USA is more flexible
~Vietnam has no hierarchies while USA has strict hierarchies
####Individualism measures integration into groups. <b>Collectivist</b> (group-focused, emphasizing "we") cultures (Vietnam 20, Indonesia 14) emphasize "we" identity, group consensus, and collective responsibility. <b>Individualist</b> (person-focused, emphasizing "I") cultures (USA 91, Australia 90) emphasize "I" identity, personal responsibility, and individual achievement. In Vietnamese culture, decisions emerge from group discussion and harmony; in American culture, individuals voice positions and compete for best idea. Neither is superior—both have strengths. Affects how employees approach decision-making, speak up in meetings, and take individual initiative. See Week 9 slides 7-10.}

::Edmondson's Psychological Safety Framework::What is psychological safety in Edmondson's framework?
{
=A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking
~A legal guarantee that team members have secure employment
~The same as trust—believing others will keep their word
~Being nice to everyone and avoiding disagreement
####Psychological safety is a <b>shared belief</b> (common understanding held by all team members) that members can take <b>interpersonal risks</b> (speak up, admit mistakes, propose ideas, challenge decisions) without fear of punishment. Differs from trust (beliefs about others' actions), niceness (avoiding conflict), and low standards (safety works WITH accountability). Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the \#1 predictor of team effectiveness. Edmondson's <b>longitudinal</b> (over time, multiple observations) research shows safety predicts innovation, learning, and performance. See Week 9 slides 10-14.}

::Edmondson's Psychological Safety Framework::What distinguishes Edmondson's Learning Zone from the Comfort Zone?
{
=Learning Zone combines high safety with high accountability; Comfort Zone has high safety but low accountability
~Learning Zone is relaxed; Comfort Zone is stressful
~Learning Zone applies to virtual teams; Comfort Zone applies to in-person teams
~Learning Zone has trust; Comfort Zone lacks trust
####Edmondson's Four Zones map team environments on Psychological Safety (Y-axis) × <b>Accountability</b> (responsibility for delivering results) (X-axis). Learning Zone (high/high) \= optimal\: people speak up AND execute. Comfort Zone (high/low) \= safe but <b>complacent</b> (satisfied without effort to improve). Anxiety Zone (low/high) \= fear-driven work and burnout. Apathy Zone (low/low) \= disengagement. For team presentations, move toward Learning Zone by establishing both psychological safety (explicit invitation to speak up) and clear deadlines with consequences. See Week 9 slides 11-14.}

::Edmondson's Psychological Safety Framework::What are the three leadership practices Edmondson identifies for building psychological safety?
{
=Set the Stage, Invite Participation, Respond Productively
~Define goals, assign tasks, monitor progress
~Build trust, encourage cohesion, celebrate wins
~Establish rules, enforce standards, reward performance
####Edmondson's three practices\: (1) Set the Stage—frame work as learning problem requiring diverse input, acknowledge leader doesn't have all answers; (2) Invite Participation—ask <b>proactive</b> (taking initiative before being asked) questions ("What are we missing?"), create structures for quiet voices; (3) Respond Productively—express appreciation even for critical feedback, <b>destigmatize</b> (remove shame or negative association from) failure ("What did we learn?"), offer help not blame. For high power distance cultures like Vietnam, "Set the Stage" is critical—leaders must <b>explicitly</b> (clearly and directly stated) give permission to speak up by saying "I need everyone's input" or "Please question my decisions." Without this, Vietnamese team members remain silent even with valuable ideas. See Week 9 slides 15-18.}

::Meyer's Three A's of Feedback::What are Erin Meyer's Three A's of effective cross-cultural feedback?
{
=Aim to Assist, Actionable, Ask First
~Analyze, Apply, Assess
~Acknowledge, Appreciate, Act
~Attention, Accuracy, Accountability
####Meyer's Three A's\: (1) Aim to Assist—give feedback ONLY with genuine <b>intent</b> (purpose or intention) to help, never to vent frustration or assert dominance; (2) Actionable—include clear, specific actions recipient can take (if no action exists, withhold the feedback); (3) Ask First—request permission before giving feedback to balance power dynamics and create <b>reciprocal</b> (mutual, each party doing the same for the other) culture. Based on Meyer's 20+ years consulting global companies. While feedback STYLE varies (direct cultures like Germany versus indirect cultures like Vietnam), these three principles apply <b>universally</b> (in all cases, across all cultures). See Week 9 slides 19-22.}

::Meyer's Three A's of Feedback::What is the purpose of Meyer's "Ask First" principle in cross-cultural feedback?
{
=To request permission before giving feedback, balancing power dynamics and creating reciprocal culture
~To ensure feedback is grammatically correct before sharing
~To determine if the recipient is in a good mood
~To find out which culture the recipient comes from
####"Ask First" solves a fundamental power problem\: unrequested feedback assumes the giver has authority to judge. Research shows men give unrequested advice to women peers 5× more than to other men—<b>undermining</b> (weakening, damaging) safety and performance. Asking permission creates equality by letting recipient choose whether to receive feedback. Framing\: "I'm working on my presentation skills—would you exchange feedback?" invites participation rather than imposing judgment. This is especially important in <b>cross-cultural</b> (involving multiple cultures) contexts where <b>implicit</b> (unstated, assumed) power assumptions differ. Vietnamese culture (high PDI) makes unsolicited feedback especially problematic—it violates hierarchy respect. See Week 9 slides 20-22.}

::Meyer's Three A's of Feedback::How do "Aim to Assist" and "Actionable" differ in Meyer's Three A's framework?
{
='Aim to Assist' concerns motivation; 'Actionable' concerns what actions the recipient can take
~'Aim to Assist' is for Western cultures; 'Actionable' is for Asian cultures
~'Aim to Assist' is for leaders; 'Actionable' is for peers
~'Aim to Assist' means be friendly; 'Actionable' means be harsh
####Meyer's Three A's have distinct purposes\: (1) Aim to Assist—YOUR <b>motivation</b> (the reason you're giving feedback) is genuine helping (not venting, showing off, or asserting dominance); (2) Actionable—THEIR ACTIONS are clear (not vague criticism like "Your slides are bad"—instead\: "Add pauses after key points"). Example\: "Your section needs restructuring" (violates Actionable). Better\: "I'd suggest moving your conclusion to paragraph one so readers know your main point <b>immediately</b> (right away, as the first thing)" (satisfies Actionable). Both principles must be satisfied for feedback to be effective. If motivation is wrong OR actions <b>ambiguous</b> (unclear, open to multiple interpretations), feedback fails—even if permission was asked (Ask First). See Week 9 slides 19-22.}

::Personal vs. Contextual Diversity::What is the main difference between personal diversity and contextual diversity?
{
=Personal diversity \= demographic characteristics (age, gender, race); Contextual diversity \= background factors (education, expertise, industry)
~Personal diversity affects task outcomes; Contextual diversity affects psychological outcomes
~Personal diversity is positive; Contextual diversity is negative
~They are the same concept with different names
####<b>Personal Diversity</b>—individual <b>demographic</b> (relating to population characteristics like age, gender, race) characteristics (nationality, personality)—impacts <b>psychological</b> (mental, emotional, relating to how people think and feel) outcomes (satisfaction, cohesion, conflict). Requires active management. <b>Contextual Diversity</b>—background factors (country origin, education, functional expertise, industry experience, work history)—impacts task outcomes (quality, creativity, innovation). Consistently produces better work. Research with 5,728 individuals across 804 teams shows contextual diversity produces "higher-quality, more creative, more innovative solutions." Distinction is critical\: LEVERAGE contextual diversity as competitive advantage; MANAGE personal diversity challenges through psychological safety. See Week 9 slides 23-28.}

::Personal vs. Contextual Diversity::Why does contextual diversity improve team performance, and how does it differ from personal diversity's effects?
{
=Contextual diversity brings different perspectives that improve task quality; Personal diversity increases psychological outcomes like cohesion but requires management
~Both types of diversity improve performance equally
~Contextual diversity improves relationships; Personal diversity improves work quality
~Diversity in general decreases team effectiveness
####Contextual diversity (different educational backgrounds, functional expertise, work experience, industry knowledge) improves task outcomes because different perspectives <b>systematically</b> (in an organized way) identify problems, generate solutions, and catch blind spots <b>homogeneous</b> (all the same, lacking diversity) teams miss. Research\: "Teams with higher contextual diversity produced higher-quality consulting reports with more creative and innovative solutions." Personal diversity (demographic differences) affects team climate—can increase conflict or cohesion depending on whether psychological safety exists. Without safety\: personal diversity increases tension. With safety\: personal diversity becomes irrelevant to performance. Strategy\: LEVERAGE contextual diversity as advantage by assigning roles based on expertise; MANAGE personal diversity by building psychological safety and <b>explicit</b> (clearly stated, not assumed) team norms. See Week 9 slides 23-28.}

::Personal vs. Contextual Diversity::According to Taras et al. (2021) research, which two cultural factors predict positive team outcomes by enabling psychological safety?
{
=High Gender Egalitarianism and Low Power Distance—both enable psychological safety
~High Uncertainty Avoidance and High Masculinity—create clear structure
~High Individualism and High Indulgence—encourage personal expression
~High Long-Term Orientation and High Collectivism—build loyalty
####Research by Taras et al. (2021) identifies two critical factors\: (1) High Gender <b>Egalitarianism</b> (equal treatment regardless of gender)—men give unrequested advice to women 5× more, <b>undermining</b> (weakening, damaging) safety; solution\: establish "Ask First" norm. (2) Low Power Distance—junior members feel safe <b>challenging</b> (questioning) seniors; solution\: <b>explicitly</b> (clearly, directly) invite junior members to speak first. Both enable psychological safety (\#1 predictor of team effectiveness). Without these, members <b>self-censor</b> (keep quiet) ideas, leading to poor decisions and reduced innovation. Teams can deliberately create <b>egalitarian</b> (equal, fair) environments using Edmondson's leadership practices. See Week 9 slides 29-32.}
