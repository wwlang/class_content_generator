$CATEGORY: Week 7: Persuasive Presentations

::Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals::Which of Aristotle's three rhetorical appeals focuses on establishing speaker credibility and trustworthiness?
{
=Ethos - credibility and character
~Pathos - emotional appeals
~Logos - logical reasoning
~Kairos - timing and context
####Aristotle identified three appeals in persuasive communication\: <b>Ethos</b> (establishing credibility and trustworthiness of the speaker), <b>Pathos</b> (appealing to audience emotions), and <b>Logos</b> (using logical reasoning and evidence). All three appeals work together in effective persuasion. See Week 7 slides 7-9.}

::Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals::How do ethos and logos differ as persuasive appeals?
{
=Ethos builds credibility and trust; Logos provides logical evidence and reasoning
~Ethos appeals to emotion; Logos appeals to credibility
~Both focus on emotional connection; they differ only in intensity
~Ethos uses statistics; Logos uses personal stories
####Ethos establishes why the audience should trust you (credentials, character, sources). Logos provides logical reasoning with evidence (data, research, <b>structured</b> (organized, methodical) arguments). Both are essential but serve different purposes in persuasion. See Week 7 slides 7-9.}

::Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals::What is the main problem with presentations that rely too heavily on logos (data and logic) while neglecting pathos (emotion)?
{
=They convince intellectually but don't inspire action
~They are too short and lack sufficient detail
~They establish too much credibility with the audience
~They use too many personal stories instead of evidence
####Duarte's research shows that presentations need balance\: too much logos (data) without pathos (emotion) leads to audiences who intellectually agree but don't take action. While logical arguments convince the mind, emotional resonance <b>spurs</b> (triggers, motivates) people into action. See Week 7 slide 8.}

::Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion::How many principles of persuasion did Cialdini identify in his research?
{
=Seven principles
~Three principles
~Six principles
~Five principles
####Cialdini's <b>Influence</b> (book title) framework identifies seven psychological principles that activate automatic compliance responses\: Reciprocity, Commitment/Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity, and Unity (added in 2021). These principles are hardwired mental shortcuts that bypass <b>analytical</b> (logical, reasoning-based) thinking. See Week 7 slide 11.}

::Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion::What distinguishes the reciprocity principle from other persuasion techniques?
{
=People feel obligated to return favors, even small unsolicited ones
~People value items that are rare or in limited supply
~People follow what similar others are doing
~People defer to credible experts and authority figures
####The Reciprocity principle works because humans feel obligated to return favors. Research shows that even small, unsolicited gifts create a sense of <b>obligation</b> (duty, responsibility to repay). The restaurant mint study found tips increased 23% when servers gave personalized extra mints. The key is that the favor comes FIRST and feels genuine, not transactional. See Week 7 slide 12.}

::Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion::Why is social proof especially powerful when people are uncertain about what to do?
{
=People assume others have information they don't and follow their lead
~Uncertainty makes people more sensitive to price discounts
~Uncertain people are more likely to trust authority figures
~People under uncertainty prefer to make independent decisions
####Social Proof is powerful under uncertainty because people assume others possess knowledge they lack. The hotel towel study showed that "75% of guests in this room reused towels" increased compliance by 33% over generic environmental appeals. When we don't know what to do, following what similar others do is an efficient <b>heuristic</b> (mental shortcut) for decision-making. See Week 7 slide 13.}

::Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion::What psychological concept underlies the Scarcity principle?
{
=Loss aversion - fear of losing feels stronger than desire for gaining
~Cognitive dissonance - inconsistency between beliefs and actions
~Social comparison - evaluating ourselves against others
~Confirmation bias - seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
####The Scarcity principle is based on <b>loss aversion</b> (stronger negative reaction to losses than positive reaction to gains), documented by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. Psychologically, losing $100 feels roughly twice as bad as gaining $100 feels good. This <b>asymmetry</b> (imbalance, unequal weighting) makes "last chance" framing incredibly powerful, explaining why British Airways Concorde sales surged after discontinuation was announced. See Week 7 slide 14.}

::Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion::How does Cialdini's Authority principle relate to Aristotle's rhetorical appeals?
{
=Authority is the modern psychological validation of Ethos (credibility)
~Authority contradicts Ethos by focusing on emotion instead of credibility
~Authority replaces Logos as the primary logical appeal
~Authority and Ethos are opposing concepts that cannot be used together
####Cialdini's Authority principle is essentially modern psychological validation of Aristotle's Ethos appeal. Both establish credibility through expert sources, credentials, and trustworthiness. Research shows citing authoritative sources increases persuasiveness by 40%. Petty & Cacioppo's <b>Elaboration Likelihood Model</b> (theory about how people process persuasive messages) found people assume cited claims are more truthful. See Week 7 slide 15.}

::SUCCESs Framework::What do the letters in the SUCCESs framework stand for?
{
=Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories
~Strategy, Unity, Commitment, Credibility, Empathy, Structure
~Simple, Universal, Clear, Credible, Engaging, Strong
~Strategic, Unexpected, Clear, Compelling, Emotional, Short
####The SUCCESs framework by Chip and Dan Heath identifies six principles for making ideas <b>sticky</b> (memorable, easy to recall)\: Simple (strip to core), Unexpected (violate expectations), Concrete (vivid details), Credible (build trust), Emotional (connect to identity), and Stories (narratives drive action). Each principle addresses a barrier to communication - attention, memory, or action. See Week 7 slide 17.}

::SUCCESs Framework::What is the main purpose of the Simple principle in the SUCCESs framework?
{
=Strip message to single most important element so people remember the core
~Reduce vocabulary to elementary school level for all audiences
~Create curiosity gaps that violate audience expectations
~Use concrete details instead of abstract concepts
####The Simple principle strips messages to their core - the "Commander's Intent." Military doctrine teaches that when plans fail, soldiers need to know the ONE essential objective. Southwest Airlines demonstrates this\: "We are THE low-fare airline" - a simple principle that guides all decisions. As the Heath brothers say\: "Simplicity isn't about dumbing down, it's about prioritizing." See Week 7 slide 18.}

::SUCCESs Framework::Why does concrete language create more persuasive messages than abstract language?
{
=Our brains remember sensory details better than abstract concepts
~Concrete language uses simpler words that are easier to spell
~Abstract language is always more professional than concrete examples
~Concrete language requires fewer words than abstract descriptions
####Concrete language works because our brains evolved to process sensory information (sights, sounds, physical objects), not abstractions like "optimize operational efficiency." When you say "4 hours every Friday," people can visualize it. The CSPI movie popcorn campaign made abstract nutrition data concrete and memorable\: "More fat than bacon-and-eggs breakfast, Big Mac lunch, AND steak dinner combined." See Week 7 slide 19.}

::Ethical Persuasion Framework::What is the key difference between ethical persuasion and manipulation?
{
=Ethical persuasion uses truthful claims toward mutual benefit; manipulation uses deception for one-sided gain
~Ethical persuasion uses only logical appeals; manipulation uses emotional appeals
~Ethical persuasion never uses psychological principles; manipulation always does
~There is no difference - all persuasion is manipulation
####The Ethical Persuasion Test asks three questions\: (1) Truth - Are claims factually accurate? (2) Transparency - Would this work if the audience knew your techniques? (3) Benefit - Are they better off if they say yes? Ethical persuasion passes all three tests; manipulation fails at least one. Cialdini calls this the "grandmother test"\: Would you persuade your grandmother to do this? See Week 7 slide 23.}
