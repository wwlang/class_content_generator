**Course:** BCI2AU Business Communication
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12, 25%) - this activity practices oral storytelling and persuasive appeals for final presentation

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Cialdini's Six Principles:** Reciprocity (give first), Commitment (start small), Social Proof (show what others do), Authority (cite experts), Liking (build rapport), Scarcity (genuine urgency). Apply at least 2 in any persuasive communication.

- **Three Story Plots:** Challenge (overcoming obstacles - inspiring), Connection (bridging gaps - heartwarming), Creativity (new approach succeeding - innovative). Choose the plot that fits your message.

- **Story Structure:** Hook (grab attention) → Conflict/Problem (create tension) → Resolution (show outcome). Classic arc that humans are wired to remember.

- **Ethos/Pathos/Logos Balance:** Stories carry pathos (emotion), but need logos (evidence) and ethos (credibility) to persuade business audiences.

**What good work looks like:**

- Story has clear hook, conflict, and resolution within 3 minutes
- At least 2 Cialdini principles demonstrably applied in the narrative
- Concrete details (names, numbers, sensory information) not abstractions
- Persuasive appeal evident - story drives toward specific takeaway
- Delivery is confident with natural eye contact and vocal variety

## Main Activity: Craft a 3-Minute Persuasive Story

**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12) - this activity practices storytelling techniques and oral persuasion skills you'll use in your final 15-minute team presentation. The Group Presentation rubric rewards "compelling evidence" and "exceptional depth" (Content & Analysis, 30%) - storytelling is how you achieve both.

**The Task:**

Develop and deliver a 3-minute persuasive story that demonstrates both storytelling craft and Cialdini's principles. This is oral communication practice - you'll tell your story aloud, not write it. Your story should persuade the audience toward a specific belief or action.

Choose ONE story type:

**Option A: Professional Challenge Story**
Tell a story about overcoming a workplace or academic challenge. Use the Challenge plot (obstacles → struggle → triumph). Apply 2+ Cialdini principles to make the story persuasive about why that approach works.

**Option B: Change Advocacy Story**
Tell a story advocating for a specific change (in your workplace, university, community). Use any plot type. Apply 2+ Cialdini principles to persuade listeners the change is necessary.

**Option C: Customer/Stakeholder Impact Story**
Tell a story about how a product, service, or decision affected a real person. Use Connection plot (before state → intervention → after state). Apply 2+ Cialdini principles to persuade about the value of that solution.

**Deliverable:**

A 3-minute oral story that includes:

1. **Clear Story Arc:**
   - Hook: Compelling opening that grabs attention (first 20 seconds)
   - Conflict: The problem, challenge, or tension (middle 2 minutes)
   - Resolution: The outcome or lesson (final 40 seconds)

2. **Persuasive Elements:**
   - At least 2 Cialdini principles demonstrably woven into narrative
   - Concrete details: Names, numbers, sensory information (not "someone" or "a company")
   - Clear takeaway: What should audience believe or do after hearing this?

3. **Oral Delivery:**
   - Practiced and timed (exactly 3 minutes ± 15 seconds)
   - Natural eye contact, vocal variety, confident presence
   - No reading from notes (outline or bullet points okay, no full script)

**Success Criteria:** (from Group Presentation Rubric - Content & Analysis 30%)

- Compelling evidence through concrete story details and specific examples
- Exceptional depth demonstrated through meaningful insights, not surface-level description
- Clear application of at least 2 Cialdini principles (must be identifiable by listeners)
- Story structure evident: distinct hook, conflict, and resolution phases
- Persuasive purpose achieved: audience understands what you want them to think/do

**Work Process:**

**Phase 1 - Story Development (35 min):**
- Choose your story option and topic (5 min)
- Outline story arc: Write hook, conflict, resolution bullet points (15 min)
- Identify which 2 Cialdini principles you'll apply and where in the story (10 min)
- Practice telling story aloud to yourself, refine for 3-minute target (5 min)

**Phase 2 - Peer Rehearsal in Triads (40 min):**
- Form groups of 3 students
- Each person delivers their 3-minute story to the triad
- After each story, 5 minutes structured feedback:
  - Listener 1: Identify the story arc - where was hook, conflict, resolution?
  - Listener 2: Identify which Cialdini principles you heard and where
  - Both listeners: What was most persuasive? What would strengthen it?
- Storyteller takes notes on feedback
- Rotate until all 3 have presented and received feedback

**Phase 3 - Revision & Re-practice (10 min):**
- Individually refine story based on feedback received
- Practice revised version aloud at least twice
- Focus on: Clearer Cialdini applications, stronger hook, tighter timing

**Class Showcase:**

At the end of the session, 3-4 students will perform their stories for the full class (time permitting). Volunteers go first. Be prepared to:

- Deliver your 3-minute story with confidence
- Afterward, briefly state (30 seconds): Which 2 Cialdini principles you used and which story plot you chose
- Answer one question from peers: "What was your biggest challenge in developing this story?"

All students should be ready to share - this is low-stakes practice for your Week 12 high-stakes presentation.

⚠️ **Participation:** Active engagement in peer rehearsal is required. Delivering your story to your triad and providing thoughtful feedback to others contributes to your participation grade (10% of course total). Come prepared to share.
