### Slide 1: Hook
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

## 33% Increase in Hotel Towel Reuse

**Just by changing one word on the sign**

"Most guests in this room reuse their towels" vs. "Please reuse your towels"

(Goldstein, Cialdini & Griskevicius, 2008)

**The power of persuasive language in business**

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome to Week 7, where we explore how small changes in communication create massive shifts in behavior
- This hotel study represents millions of dollars in cost savings—all from understanding persuasion psychology

**Key Points:**
- This isn't manipulation—it's understanding how people naturally make decisions
- The difference: social proof (what others do) vs. generic request
- Today you'll learn the scientific principles behind persuasive communication
- This applies to proposals, presentations, negotiations, leadership

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Grab/Shopee use these principles constantly—countdown timers, "X people bought this," limited seats
- You're already experiencing persuasion daily; today you become intentional users

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick question: When was the last time you made a purchase because 'only 3 left' or 'sale ends tonight'? Be honest!"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see what you'll master today to create this kind of influence ethically..."

---

### Slide 2: Learning Objectives

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Aristotle's three rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos) to business presentations
2. **Identify** and **use** Cialdini's seven principles of persuasion in professional communication
3. **Construct** persuasive narratives using the SUCCESs storytelling framework
4. **Design** calls to action that drive specific audience behaviors
5. **Evaluate** ethical boundaries between influence and manipulation

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These aren't just theoretical—each objective connects directly to your Persuasive Proposal due this week"

**Key Points:**
- Aristotle's appeals = the foundation (2,300 years old, still the best framework)
- Cialdini's principles = the psychology (backed by 35+ years of research)
- SUCCESs = the structure (how to make your message stick)
- Call to action = the outcome (get people to do what you propose)
- Ethics = the boundary (persuasion vs. manipulation)

**Example:**
- Your Persuasive Proposal needs all five: credibility (ethos), emotion (pathos), logic (logos), persuasive techniques (Cialdini), memorable structure (SUCCESs), clear next step (CTA)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Look at objective 5—why do you think we emphasize ethics in persuasion? Turn to your neighbor and discuss for 30 seconds."

**Transition:**
- "Before we dive in, let's connect this to your assessment..."

### Slide 3: Assessment Connection - PROPOSAL DUE THIS WEEK
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## How This Prepares You

**Persuasive Proposal (15%) - DUE THIS WEEK**

| Component | Today's Content | Tutorial Practice |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Opening hook** | SUCCESs: Unexpected principle | Draft 3 opening options |
| **Credibility building** | Ethos + Authority principle | Identify expertise signals |
| **Logical argument** | Logos + structured reasoning | SCQA framework application |
| **Emotional appeal** | Pathos + Stories principle | Personal stakeholder story |
| **Call to action** | Commitment principle + clear ask | Specific, measurable request |

**Also builds toward:** Group Presentation (Week 12, 40% total)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is an assessment week—your Persuasive Proposal is due. Today gives you the frameworks to finalize it."
- "Every concept we cover today should appear in your proposal"

**Key Points:**
- Opening hook: Use "Unexpected" from SUCCESs—surprise your reader to create curiosity
- Credibility: Establish ethos through research, expertise, track record
- Logical argument: Use SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) from Week 3
- Emotional appeal: Tell a story about a real person affected by your proposal
- Call to action: Be specific ("Approve $5,000 budget by Friday") not vague ("Consider this")

**Example:**
- Vietnamese student example: Proposal to implement flex work policy
  - Hook: "Our competitor gained 40% more job applicants after one policy change"
  - Ethos: Cite HR research from top universities
  - Logos: Cost-benefit analysis with data
  - Pathos: Story of working parent's daily commute struggle
  - CTA: "Approve 6-month pilot starting next quarter"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which component of your proposal feels weakest right now? We'll strengthen that today."

**Transition:**
- "Let's look at our roadmap for the next two hours..."

## PART 1: THE CLASSICAL FOUNDATION (5 slides)

### Slide 5: Part 1 Introduction
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## PART 1

# The Classical Foundation

**Aristotle's Three Rhetorical Appeals**

*Ethos • Pathos • Logos*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "In 350 BCE, Aristotle wrote 'Rhetoric'—it's still the most-cited work on persuasion today"
- "Every business school teaches this. Why? Because it works."

**Key Points:**
- Rhetorical appeals = the three ways humans are persuaded
- Aristotle observed these patterns in Athens' marketplace and political forums
- 2,300+ years later, neuroscience confirms he was right
- Modern applications: TED talks, sales pitches, political campaigns, your proposal

**Example:**
- Steve Jobs' iPhone launch (2007): Ethos (Apple's track record), Pathos (emotional product videos), Logos (technical specs)
- Every successful pitch uses all three

**Check Understanding:**
- "Who here has heard of ethos, pathos, logos before?" (show of hands)
- "Good—let's go deeper than definitions into practical application"

**Transition:**
- "First appeal: establishing credibility before you say anything..."

---

### Slide 6: Ethos - Credibility and Character
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Ethos: Establishing Credibility

**Definition:** Your credibility as a speaker—why should the audience trust you?

**Built through:**
- **Expertise** - Demonstrating knowledge and experience
- **Common ground** - Showing you understand the audience
- **Character** - Displaying honesty, fairness, goodwill
- **Appropriate balance** - Matching tone to audience expectations

**In business presentations:**
- Citing reputable sources and research
- Sharing relevant credentials or experience
- Acknowledging counterarguments fairly
- Understanding audience's values and concerns

**Example:** "As someone who's managed remote teams for 5 years, I've seen firsthand..." (expertise + experience)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Ethos comes before you even open your mouth—it's the credibility you bring into the room"
- "Without ethos, your audience won't listen. With it, they lean in."

**Key Points:**
- Expertise: You don't need to be the world's top expert, just knowledgeable enough to be credible
- Common ground: "I understand your concerns about budget because I manage one too"
- Character: Honesty matters—admit limitations, acknowledge opposing views
- Appropriate balance: Don't oversell or undersell your expertise

**Example:**
- Nancy Duarte's article (MIT Sloan 2024): "If you don't understand your audience, you risk creating an imbalance—it hurts your credibility"
- Vietnamese context: In proposals to senior leaders, establish ethos by referencing their previous initiatives—shows you've done homework
- Bad ethos: "Trust me, this will work" (no evidence)
- Good ethos: "This approach succeeded at Samsung Vietnam and Vingroup—here's the data"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about a time someone lost credibility with you. What did they do?" (pair-share 30 seconds)

**Transition:**
- "Ethos gets you in the door. Pathos keeps them listening..."

---

### Slide 7: Pathos - Emotional Connection
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Pathos: Engaging Emotions

**Definition:** Appealing to the audience's emotions, values, and beliefs

**Created through:**
- **Stories and anecdotes** - Personal narratives that resonate
- **Vivid imagery** - Concrete, sensory details
- **Metaphors and analogies** - Making abstract concepts relatable
- **Value alignment** - Connecting to what the audience cares about

**In business presentations:**
- Customer success stories
- "Imagine if..." scenarios
- Photos and videos of real people
- Connecting proposal to company mission/values

**Example:** "Imagine the frustration of a customer waiting 3 days for a response that takes 3 minutes to send."

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Pathos isn't about manipulation—it's about making your logical argument feel real and relevant"
- "Nancy Duarte: 'While logical arguments can lead to intellectual agreement, emotional resonance is often what spurs action'"

**Key Points:**
- Stories are the most powerful pathos tool—humans are wired for narrative
- Vivid imagery: Don't say "inefficient," say "employees spending 2 hours daily on manual data entry"
- Metaphors: Complex ideas become simple (e.g., "Our system is a bridge between departments")
- Value alignment: If company values innovation, frame proposal as innovative

**Example:**
- Bad pathos: "This is really important and you should care"
- Good pathos: "Meet Linh, a customer service rep who receives 200 emails daily. She works overtime every week just to keep up. Our solution gives her 10 hours back per week—time she can spend solving complex customer problems instead of sorting messages."
- Vietnamese context: Family-oriented culture values work-life balance—use stories about employees spending more time with family

**Check Understanding:**
- "Duarte warns about being 'too emotional or too analytical.' What happens if a presentation is ALL pathos, no logos?"
- Expected answer: "Sounds manipulative, lacks substance, audience questions credibility"

**Transition:**
- "Pathos engages the heart. Now we need the head..."

---

### Slide 8: Logos - Logic and Evidence
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Logos: Reasoning with Evidence

**Definition:** Using logic, data, and structured reasoning to support your argument

**Demonstrated through:**
- **Statistics and data** - Quantitative evidence
- **Research citations** - Expert testimony and studies
- **Logical structure** - Clear cause-effect relationships
- **Visual evidence** - Charts, graphs, diagrams

**In business presentations:**
- ROI calculations and financial projections
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Process diagrams and timelines
- Case study results with metrics

**Example:** "Companies using this system reduced customer response time by 47% and increased satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.5 out of 5."

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Logos is what business audiences expect—they want to see the numbers, the logic, the proof"
- "But logos alone is dry. It needs ethos and pathos to drive action."

**Key Points:**
- Statistics: Use specific numbers (47%) not vague terms (almost half)
- Research citations: "According to MIT Sloan research..." beats "Studies show..."
- Logical structure: If A, then B, therefore C—make reasoning transparent
- Visual evidence: A well-designed chart communicates faster than a paragraph of numbers

**Example:**
- Vietnamese business context: Data-driven decision making is highly valued
- Logos framework for proposals: Current state (data) → Problem (data) → Solution (data) → Expected outcome (projected data)
- Bad logos: "This will probably save money"
- Good logos: "Based on our 3-month pilot, we project 23% cost reduction ($45,000 annually) with 95% confidence interval"

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's the risk of a presentation that's ALL logos, no pathos or ethos?"
- Expected answer: "Boring, doesn't inspire action, audience forgets it, feels like reading a spreadsheet"

**Transition:**
- "Duarte's research shows the best presentations balance all three. Let's see how..."

---

### Slide 9: Balancing the Three Appeals
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Case Study: Balancing Ethos, Pathos, Logos

**Scenario:** Proposing remote work policy to conservative management

**Too much logos (analytical):**
"Remote work increases productivity 13% (Stanford study), reduces office costs $10,000/employee/year, decreases turnover 50%..."
*Result:* Feels like a spreadsheet. No emotional connection.

**Too much pathos (emotional):**
"Employees are exhausted from commutes. Imagine the joy of working from home! Think of the work-life balance!"
*Result:* Sounds idealistic. Where's the business case?

**Balanced approach:**
- **Ethos:** "I've researched 15 companies who implemented this, including Vingroup..."
- **Logos:** "Stanford study shows 13% productivity gain, $10K/employee savings..."
- **Pathos:** "Our employee survey shows 78% would stay longer if we offered flexibility. Meet Tuan, who spends 3 hours daily commuting..."
- **Result:** Credible, logical, AND emotionally resonant

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is from Nancy Duarte's 2024 article—real scenario showing imbalance dangers"
- "Imbalance hurts credibility and reduces persuasive impact"

**Key Points:**
- Too much logos: Common mistake in Vietnamese business culture (very data-driven)—but data doesn't inspire
- Too much pathos: Seen as emotional, unprofessional, lacking rigor
- Balance: Start with ethos (why trust you), support with logos (the data), humanize with pathos (the story)
- Duarte's advice: Do a "slide inventory"—count logos slides vs. pathos slides, aim for balance

**Example:**
- For your Persuasive Proposal: Include data tables (logos), customer testimonials (pathos), and cite research (ethos)
- Sequence matters: Hook with pathos → establish ethos → build case with logos → close with pathos call to action
- Vietnamese management often wants logos first—adapt sequence for your audience

**Check Understanding:**
- "Look at your current proposal draft. Quick self-assessment: Is it logos-heavy, pathos-heavy, or balanced?"
- "No judgment—just awareness. You can adjust in tutorial today."

**Transition:**
- "Aristotle gave us the foundation. Now let's add modern psychology..."

## PART 2: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF YES (6 slides)

### Slide 10: Part 2 Introduction
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## PART 2

# The Psychology of Yes

**Cialdini's Seven Principles of Persuasion**

*The science behind why people say yes*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Robert Cialdini spent 35+ years studying persuasion—going undercover in car dealerships, fundraising organizations, sales training programs"
- "His book 'Influence' has 7+ million copies sold, cited 56,000+ times, assigned at Stanford GSB for 25+ years"
- "Warren Buffett called it 'one of the best business books of all time'"

**Key Points:**
- These aren't theories—they're proven psychological principles backed by hundreds of studies
- Each principle activates automatic compliance responses (mental shortcuts)
- You experience these daily: Shopee flash sales, Grab surge pricing, "limited seats" on flights
- Today you learn to use them intentionally and ethically

**Example:**
- Cialdini's restaurant study: Tips increased 3% with one mint, 14% with two, 23% when waiter brought one mint, walked away, then "returned" with a second "just for you"
- Same product, different persuasion technique = 23% difference

**Check Understanding:**
- "Before we begin: persuasion vs. manipulation. What's the difference?" (quick discussion)
- "Key distinction: Persuasion respects autonomy; manipulation deceives or coerces"

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with the most powerful principle..."

---

### Slide 11: Principle 1 - Reciprocity
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Reciprocity: The Power of Giving First

**Definition:** People feel obligated to return favors and concessions

**How it works:**
- Receiving creates psychological debt
- We're culturally conditioned to reciprocate
- Even small gifts trigger the obligation

**Business applications:**
- Free samples, trials, consultations
- Giving valuable content before asking for sale
- Making concessions in negotiation to encourage reciprocation
- Providing help before requesting assistance

**Example:** Software companies offering free trials → users feel obligated to consider purchase

**Key stat:** Restaurant tips increased 23% when mints were given as "personalized gifts" vs. standard service

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Reciprocity is hardwired—across all cultures, receiving creates obligation to give back"
- "It's why free samples work so well"

**Key Points:**
- The gift must come first, with no strings attached (perceived)
- Personalization amplifies effect (restaurant mint study)
- Reciprocity works even when gift is unsolicited
- Vietnamese culture particularly values reciprocity (social harmony)

**Example:**
- Vietnamese business: Giving small gift at first meeting (tea, local product) before discussing business
- Bad reciprocity: "I'm giving you this so you'll buy" (too obvious)
- Good reciprocity: "Here's a free guide to help with your problem. If you want more support, we also offer..."
- Proposal application: Give reader valuable research/insights in proposal before asking for approval
- Shopee/Lazada: Free shipping voucher before asking you to shop

**Check Understanding:**
- "Where have you experienced reciprocity this week? Grab voucher? Free coffee sample at Highlands?"

**Transition:**
- "Reciprocity gets attention. The next principle locks in commitment..."

---

### Slide 12: Principles 2-3 - Commitment and Social Proof
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Commitment & Consistency + Social Proof

**Commitment & Consistency:**
People align future behavior with past commitments (especially public ones)

- Start with small commitments → build to larger
- Written commitments more powerful than verbal
- Public commitments harder to break

**Example:** Health clinic reduced no-shows 18% by having patients write their own appointment cards

**Social Proof:**
People look to others' actions to guide their own, especially under uncertainty

- Testimonials and case studies
- "X customers already using this"
- "Most popular choice" labels

**Example:** Hotel towel reuse increased 33% with "Most guests in this room reuse towels" messaging

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Two principles that work powerfully together"

**Key Points - Commitment:**
- Small commitments lead to big ones: "Would you consider?" → "Can we schedule 15 min?" → "Here's the contract"
- Written is powerful: Sign petition → more likely to donate later
- Public is binding: Announce goal to team → more likely to achieve it
- Proposal application: Get stakeholder to agree to small step ("Can I present to your team?") before asking for full approval

**Key Points - Social Proof:**
- We follow the herd, especially when uncertain
- "Similar others" most persuasive (hotel example: "guests in THIS room")
- Vietnamese culture: Group harmony valued, social proof particularly effective
- Numbers matter: "Join 10,000 users" beats "Join our growing community"

**Example:**
- Commitment: "Before I ask you to approve this proposal, can you review this 2-page summary?" (small commitment first)
- Social proof: "Three other departments have piloted this successfully" (similar others)
- Shopee: "X people bought in last hour" (social proof) + "Only 3 left" (scarcity, next principle)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why is social proof more effective when it's 'similar others'?" (pair discussion)
- Answer: We look to people like us for guidance

**Transition:**
- "Social proof shows what others do. The next two show who to listen to..."

---

### Slide 13: Principles 4-5 - Authority and Liking
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Authority + Liking

**Authority:**
People defer to credible experts and legitimate authorities

- Credentials, titles, uniforms
- Expert testimony and endorsements
- Demonstrating expertise through content

**Example:** "9 out of 10 dentists recommend..." (expert authority)

**Liking:**
People say yes to those they like, trust, and feel similar to

- Finding commonalities
- Genuine compliments
- Collaboration and rapport-building
- Physical attractiveness (yes, it matters)

**Example:** MBA negotiations study - Exchanging personal information first led to 90% agreement vs. 55% without rapport

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Authority = Ethos from Aristotle. Cialdini added the psychology of how it works."

**Key Points - Authority:**
- Credentials matter: PhD, CEO title, university affiliation
- Content marketing = demonstrating authority (giving expertise before asking for sale)
- Vietnamese culture: High respect for authority (hierarchical society)
- Proposal application: Cite experts—"According to Harvard Business Review..." or "Dr. Nguyen from VNU recommends..."
- Warning: False authority backfires catastrophically

**Key Points - Liking:**
- Similarity: "I'm also from Hanoi," "I also studied at NEU"
- Compliments: Must be genuine, specific ("I really admire your team's customer service approach")
- Collaboration: Working together creates liking (Tupperware party model)
- Vietnamese business: Building personal relationships before business discussions (coffee, meals)

**Example:**
- Authority: Proposal cites research from Stanford, MIT, local universities
- Liking: Reference shared experience—"As fellow BBA graduates, we understand the pressure to demonstrate ROI..."
- Combined: "Professor Tran from NEU, who you mentioned admiring, recommends this approach..." (authority + liking through connection)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about someone who persuaded you recently. Did you like them? Did they seem like an authority? Usually both, right?"

**Transition:**
- "Two more principles—these create urgency..."

---

### Slide 14: Principles 6-7 - Scarcity and Unity
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Scarcity + Unity

**Scarcity:**
People value what's rare or diminishing; fear of missing out drives action

- Limited time ("Sale ends Friday")
- Limited quantity ("Only 3 seats left")
- Exclusive access ("Members only")
- Loss framing ("Don't miss out" vs. "Gain benefits")

**Example:** British Airways Concorde sales surged after discontinuation announcement

**Unity (Added 2021):**
People influenced by shared group identity and belonging

- "We" language vs. "you" language
- Shared experiences and identities
- Common goals and values

**Example:** "Don't Mess with Texas" campaign reduced litter 72% by appealing to Texan identity

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Scarcity is everywhere in Vietnamese e-commerce—you can't escape it!"
- "Unity is Cialdini's newest addition (2021 expanded edition)"

**Key Points - Scarcity:**
- Loss aversion is powerful: We fear losing more than we desire gaining
- Countdown timers, "only X left," "limited time"
- Must be genuine—fake scarcity destroys trust
- Proposal application: "Competitor is launching similar initiative next quarter" or "Budget window closes in 3 weeks"
- Vietnamese e-commerce masters: Shopee/Lazada flash sales, Grab surge pricing

**Key Points - Unity:**
- "We" creates belonging: "We, as a team..." vs. "You should..."
- Shared identity: Company values, department goals, national pride
- Vietnamese culture: Strong in-group orientation (family, company, nation)
- More powerful than liking—it's about shared essence, not just affinity

**Example:**
- Scarcity: "This budget allocation is available only this fiscal year—next year's priorities will shift"
- Unity: "As a company committed to innovation [shared value], this proposal aligns with our mission..."
- Combined: "We [unity] have a brief window [scarcity] to establish market leadership"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Grab shows 'High demand - prices higher than usual.' Which principles? Social proof + scarcity!"

**Transition:**
- "Seven principles. Now let's learn how to structure persuasive messages..."

---

### Slide 15: Applying Cialdini's Principles Ethically
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "In the increasingly overloaded lives we lead, more than ever we need shortcuts or rules of thumb to guide our decision-making."
> — Robert Cialdini

**The ethical standard:**
- ✅ Highlight genuine benefits (persuasion)
- ❌ Fabricate scarcity or social proof (manipulation)

**Use principles to:**
- Make good decisions easier
- Reduce friction for mutually beneficial outcomes
- Help audiences see value they might miss

**Don't use to:**
- Deceive or coerce
- Create false urgency
- Exploit vulnerabilities

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Cialdini's quote reminds us: These principles exist because humans use mental shortcuts"
- "Persuasion helps people make good decisions faster. Manipulation exploits shortcuts for selfish gain."

**Key Points:**
- Ethical persuasion: Your proposal genuinely benefits the organization → Use principles to overcome natural resistance to change
- Manipulation: Your proposal mainly benefits you → Use principles to trick decision-makers
- Truth test: Would you be comfortable if audience knew your persuasion techniques?
- Vietnamese business ethics: Trust and long-term relationships valued—manipulation damages both

**Example:**
- Ethical scarcity: "Budget really does close Friday" ✅
- Unethical scarcity: "I'm telling everyone it closes Friday but it doesn't" ❌
- Ethical social proof: "Other teams using this successfully" (true) ✅
- Unethical social proof: "Everyone is doing this" (false) ❌

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you're using scarcity in your proposal, ask: Is this genuinely time-sensitive, or am I creating fake urgency?"
- "Honest reflection now saves your credibility later"

**Transition:**
- "We have the psychology. Now we need structure to make messages memorable..."

**[5-MINUTE BREAK]**

## PART 3: MAKING IDEAS STICK (5 slides)

### Slide 16: Part 3 Introduction
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## PART 3

# Making Ideas Stick

**Heath & Heath's SUCCESs Framework**

*Why some ideas survive and others die*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Welcome back! We've covered why people say yes (Cialdini). Now we learn how to make your message memorable."
- "Chip Heath is Stanford GSB professor. His book 'Made to Stick' has sold 2+ million copies, translated into 33 languages"
- "Required reading at Wharton, Harvard, Cornell"

**Key Points:**
- Problem: You spend hours crafting proposal/presentation → Audience forgets it in 24 hours
- Solution: SUCCESs principles make ideas "sticky"—memorable and actionable
- Each letter represents one principle that addresses a barrier to communication
- These work together, but even using 2-3 makes dramatic difference

**Example:**
- "Don't Mess with Texas" campaign: 73% recall months later, 72% litter reduction in 5 years
- Used multiple SUCCESs principles—we'll analyze which ones

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think of a presentation you heard last month. Can you remember the main point?" (usually no)
- "Now think of a great story someone told. Can you remember it?" (usually yes)
- "That's the power of sticky ideas"

**Transition:**
- "Let's decode the formula..."

---

### Slide 17: SUCCESs Framework Overview
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## The SUCCESs Model

**S - Simple:** Strip to core; find single most important element
"Simplicity isn't dumbing down, it's prioritizing"

**U - Unexpected:** Violate expectations; create curiosity gaps
"The most basic way to get attention is to break a pattern"

**C - Concrete:** Use vivid, tangible details vs. abstractions
"Abstraction makes it harder to understand and remember"

**C - Credible:** Build trust through sources, details, or testable claims
"Statistics are rarely meaningful in and of themselves"

**E - Emotional:** Connect to personal identity and self-interest
"We are wired to feel things for people, not abstractions"

**S - Stories:** Narratives as vicarious experience that drive action
"Stories are like flight simulators for the brain"

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Six principles, each addressing a different barrier: attention, memory, action"

**Key Points - Quick Overview:**
- **Simple:** If you say three things, you say nothing. Find the core.
- **Unexpected:** Humans pay attention to surprises, not the expected
- **Concrete:** "Avoid office jargon" is abstract. "Cut PowerPoint slides in half" is concrete.
- **Credible:** Not just expert sources—vivid details and testable claims work too
- **Emotional:** "30% cost reduction" is boring. "You'll work 2 fewer weekends monthly" is emotional.
- **Stories:** We remember stories 22x more than facts alone (Stanford study)

**Example:**
- JFK Moon Speech (1962): "We choose to go to the moon in this decade" = Simple + Concrete + Emotional
- Subway's Jared: Lost 245 pounds eating Subway = Concrete + Credible (verifiable) + Stories
- Your proposal: Which principles could you apply?

**Check Understanding:**
- "Look at your proposal opening paragraph. Which SUCCESs principles does it use?"
- "Most drafts use 1-2 at most. Goal: Use 3-4."

**Transition:**
- "Let's go deeper into the most powerful ones for business..."

---

### Slide 18: Simple + Unexpected - Getting Attention
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## S + U: Simple + Unexpected

**Simple: Find the Core**
- Southwest Airlines: "We are THE low-fare airline"
- Everything else flows from that one core idea
- Test: Would you sacrifice this for anything?

**Unexpected: Break the Pattern**
- Create curiosity gaps: open questions before answers
- Start with surprising statistics
- Use mystery: "What if I told you..."

**Case Study: "Don't Mess with Texas"**
- **Context:** Texas had massive littering problem
- **Simple:** One phrase, one action (don't litter)
- **Unexpected:** Used tough, masculine appeal (unexpected for environmental campaign)
- **Result:** 73% recall, 72% litter reduction in 5 years

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "First two principles work together: Simplicity makes it memorable, Unexpectedness makes people pay attention"

**Key Points - Simple:**
- "Don't Mess with Texas" = 4 words. Could've been "Please Practice Environmental Stewardship" (boring, forgettable)
- For your proposal: What's the ONE idea? "Remote work increases productivity"? "This tool saves money"?
- Commander's Intent (military): If soldiers remember only one thing, what is it?
- Proverbs are simple: "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" (not "Always prioritize certain small gains over uncertain larger ones")

**Key Points - Unexpected:**
- Curiosity gap: "Our competitor made one change and gained 40% more applicants. What was it?" (now they're curious)
- Vietnamese proposal context: Start with surprising local statistic
- Don't just inform—surprise, then explain
- Your hotel towel statistic from Slide 1 = Unexpected

**Example:**
- Bad opening: "I propose we implement a new software system"
- Good opening: "Our customer service team spends 100 hours weekly on a task that should take 15. Here's how we fix it."

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's the core idea of your proposal? Can you say it in one sentence?"

**Transition:**
- "Attention grabbed. Now make it real and believable..."

### Slide 19: Concrete + Credible - Making It Real
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## C + C: Concrete + Credible

**Concrete: Vivid, Tangible Details**
- Use sensory language and specific examples
- "White Ford truck" beats "vehicle"
- "2 hours daily" beats "significant time"

**Credible: Build Trust**
- Anti-authority credibility: "I used this myself"
- Vivid details that ring true
- Testable claims: "Try it yourself"

**Case Study: Movie Popcorn Campaign**
- **Abstract:** "Movie popcorn is unhealthy"
- **Concrete:** "A medium popcorn has more fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, Big Mac lunch, and steak dinner combined"
- **Result:** National media coverage, behavior change

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Concrete and Credible work together to overcome skepticism"
- "People dismiss abstractions but can't ignore vivid, specific details"

**Key Points - Concrete:**
- Movie popcorn example: Made abstract "unhealthy" into concrete "more than 3 full meals"
- Asian proverb: "Tap water from the well of truth" beats "Communicate honestly"
- For proposals: Don't say "improve efficiency"—say "reduce report generation from 4 hours to 20 minutes"
- Vietnamese context: Use local examples, Vietnamese companies, specific HCMC/Hanoi situations

**Key Points - Credible:**
- You don't always need PhDs—vivid details create credibility
- "Sinatra Test": If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere (one proof covers all)
- Testable: "Ask any employee about current wait times"
- For proposals: Include specific data from your organization, not just external research

**Example:**
- Abstract: "This will save money"
- Concrete: "This eliminates 847 manual reports monthly—each taking 45 minutes"
- Credible: "I tested this in my department for 2 months. Here's the data."

**Check Understanding:**
- "Find an abstract claim in your proposal. How can you make it concrete with specific numbers or examples?"

**Transition:**
- "They understand and believe you. Now make them care..."

---

### Slide 20: Emotional + Stories - Driving Action
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## E + S: Emotional + Stories

**Emotional: Make Them Care**
- Appeal to identity and self-interest
- "Mother Teresa Effect": People give to one person, not millions
- WIIFM: What's In It For Me (or people like me)?

**Stories: Action Through Narrative**
- Challenge plot: Overcoming obstacles (inspiring)
- Connection plot: Bridging gaps (heartwarming)
- Creativity plot: New approach succeeding (innovative)

**Case Study: Jared from Subway**
- **Emotional:** Personal transformation, relatable struggle
- **Stories:** Specific journey (245 lbs → healthy)
- **Challenge plot:** Overcame obesity through determination + Subway
- **Result:** Subway sales increased $2.3M in first year of campaign

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Logic makes people think. Emotion makes people act."
- "Heath brothers: 'Stories are flight simulators for the brain'—we experience them vicariously"

**Key Points - Emotional:**
- Mother Teresa: "If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will."
- Statistics are abstract; individual stories are emotional
- Identity appeal: "Don't Mess with Texas" worked because it appealed to Texan identity
- Vietnamese culture: Family, community, national pride are strong emotional triggers
- WIIFM: Don't say "company benefits"—say "you'll leave work 1 hour earlier daily"

**Key Points - Stories:**
- Three plots: Challenge (David vs. Goliath), Connection (Good Samaritan), Creativity (Newton's apple)
- Stories provide context, make messages memorable, inspire action
- For proposals: Tell story of one affected person, not just statistics
- Vietnamese business: Customer/employee stories with real names create trust

**Example:**
- No emotion: "Proposal will increase employee satisfaction 15%"
- With emotion: "Meet Trang, who misses her daughter's bedtime 4 nights weekly due to overtime. This proposal gives her those evenings back."
- Story structure: Trang's current struggle (Challenge) → Solution → Trang's new reality

**Check Understanding:**
- "Does your proposal include a story about a real person? If not, add one in tutorial."

**Transition:**
- "SUCCESs makes ideas stick. Now let's apply this to organizational change..."

## PART 4: FROM STORIES TO ACTION (6 slides)

### Slide 21: Part 4 Introduction
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## PART 4

# From Stories to Action

**Change Narratives + Ethical Boundaries**

*Bringing it all together*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Final section: Applying everything to high-stakes persuasion—driving organizational change"
- "We'll learn the 4-step change storytelling framework from Harvard Business School faculty"
- "Then close with ethical boundaries and call-to-action design"

**Key Points:**
- Why change communication? Because proposals often ask for change (new process, new tool, new policy)
- Change is hard—people resist even beneficial changes
- Storytelling helps overcome resistance by making change feel necessary and achievable
- This synthesizes everything: Aristotle + Cialdini + SUCCESs

**Example:**
- Your Persuasive Proposal likely requests some kind of change
- Could be small (new software) or large (policy shift)
- This framework helps structure your narrative for maximum buy-in

**Check Understanding:**
- "How many of you are proposing some kind of change? New process, tool, policy?" (show of hands)
- "This framework is for you"

**Transition:**
- "Let's learn from HBS professors who advised Uber's transformation..."

### Slide 22: Four Steps for Change-Driving Stories
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Four-Step Change Storytelling Framework

**Source:** Frei & Morriss (2023), Harvard Business Review

1. **Understand deeply, describe simply**
   Distill complex change into clear, memorable terms

2. **Honor the past**
   Acknowledge organizational history to build credibility and reduce resistance

3. **Articulate a persuasive mandate**
   Build urgency—explain why change is necessary NOW

4. **Lay out a rigorous and optimistic path forward**
   Provide clear roadmap that inspires confidence

**Key insight:** "A simple, often-repeated story is more effective than complex explanations at aligning organizational energy"

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Written by Frances Frei (HBS, advised Uber) and Anne Morriss in HBR 2023"
- "Based on real organizational transformations—tested under pressure"

**Key Points - Four Steps:**
- **Step 1 - Simple:** Connects to SUCCESs Simple principle. Don't say "digital transformation roadmap initiative"—say "We're moving sales online"
- **Step 2 - Honor past:** Reduces resistance. "Our in-person sales built this company AND customer behavior has changed"
- **Step 3 - Mandate:** Urgency without panic. "Why now? Competitor launched online, we're losing market share"
- **Step 4 - Path forward:** Combines optimism (we can do this) with rigor (here's exactly how)

**Example:**
- For your proposal:
  - Step 1: "We're eliminating manual reporting"
  - Step 2: "Manual reporting served us well when we had 20 employees. At 200, it doesn't scale."
  - Step 3: "Each month we delay costs $5K in wasted hours"
  - Step 4: "6-month implementation: Month 1-2 pilot, Month 3-4 training, Month 5-6 full rollout"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which step do proposals typically skip? Usually step 2 (honoring past)—they jump straight to 'old way is bad, new way is good' and create resistance"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see this framework in action with a famous case..."

### Slide 23: Case Study - Domino's "We Make Bad Pizza"
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Case Study: Domino's Transformation

**Context (2009):**
Domino's delivered pizza in 30 minutes but quality was terrible

**The Challenge:**
Create urgency when operational metrics looked good

**The Story CEO Patrick Doyle Told:**

1. **Simple:** "Our pizza tastes like cardboard. We're going to make great pizza."
2. **Honor the past:** "We built this company on speed and value—that was right for the time."
3. **Mandate:** "But taste matters more now. Customers are choosing competitors."
4. **Path forward:** "We're reformulating every recipe. We'll be transparent about our mistakes."

**The Result:**
- Stock price: $8 (2009) → $460 (2023)
- Employee buy-in through honest acknowledgment
- Created permission to transform

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "One of the most famous corporate turnarounds in business history"
- "Doyle's honesty was radical—most CEOs hide problems"

**Key Points:**
- Step 1 - Simple: Didn't say "enhance product quality metrics"—said "our pizza is bad"
- Step 2 - Honor past: Acknowledged speed/value strategy was historically right (reduced defensiveness from employees who'd worked there for years)
- Step 3 - Mandate: Customer preferences changed (external pressure, not just internal decision)
- Step 4 - Path forward: Specific action (reformulate) + transparent process (admit mistakes publicly)
- Result: Built credibility (Ethos) through vulnerability

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Admitting problems is culturally challenging (face-saving important)
- But Doyle showed: Honesty → Trust → Permission to change
- For your proposal: Don't hide current problems. "Our current process works, but customer expectations have evolved..."
- Authority principle (Cialdini): Admitting weakness paradoxically builds credibility when followed by solution

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why did honoring the past (Step 2) matter? Because long-time employees built that system—dismissing it dismisses them"

**Transition:**
- "Story structure done. Now let's talk about the ending: call to action..."

---

### Slide 24: Designing Effective Calls to Action
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## The Call to Action

**Definition:** The specific behavior you want your audience to perform

**Characteristics of strong CTAs:**
- **Specific:** "Approve $15K budget" not "Consider this proposal"
- **Measurable:** Clear success criteria
- **Time-bound:** "By Friday EOD" not "soon"
- **Single action:** One clear next step, not multiple options
- **Easy to execute:** Remove friction

**Persuasion principles to use:**
- **Commitment:** Start with small ask, build to bigger
- **Scarcity:** Genuine time constraints
- **Authority:** Include endorsements or precedents

**Example CTA:** "Please approve Phase 1 pilot budget ($5,000) by Friday so we can begin testing with Marketing department next week."

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Your entire presentation builds to this moment—don't waste it with vague language"
- "Specific CTAs are 3x more likely to generate action (Columbia research)"

**Key Points:**
- Specific: "Consider implementing" = no action. "Sign approval form" = action.
- Measurable: How will you know they said yes?
- Time-bound: Creates urgency (Scarcity principle). Must be genuine.
- Single action: Don't give 5 options—decision fatigue kills action
- Easy: Include approval form, draft email, calendar link—remove all friction

**Example - Bad CTAs:**
- "I hope you'll think about this proposal" (no action)
- "Let me know if you have questions" (puts burden on them)
- "We should implement this at some point" (no timeline)

**Example - Good CTAs:**
- "Please review and sign the attached approval form by Friday 5 PM"
- "Reply 'approved' to this email to initiate Phase 1"
- "Join our 30-minute demo next Tuesday at 2 PM [calendar link attached]"

**Vietnamese context:**
- May need softer language for hierarchy: "I respectfully request approval..." but still be specific
- Follow-up is culturally appropriate: "I'll follow up Thursday if you need any additional information"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Look at your proposal's current CTA. Is it specific, measurable, and time-bound? If not, revise now."

**Transition:**
- "Strong CTAs drive action. But only if you stay ethical..."

### Slide 25: Ethical Persuasion - Drawing the Line
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

## Persuasion vs. Manipulation

| Persuasion (Ethical) | Manipulation (Unethical) |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Highlights genuine benefits | Fabricates or exaggerates benefits |
| Discloses relevant information | Withholds critical information |
| Respects autonomy and choice | Coerces or deceives |
| Mutually beneficial outcome | One-sided benefit |
| Transparent techniques | Hidden agenda |
| Long-term relationship focus | Short-term transaction |

**Test your communication:**
- Would you be comfortable if the audience knew your persuasion techniques?
- Are you helping them make a good decision or tricking them into a bad one?
- Will this decision benefit them, or only you?
- Are you disclosing all relevant information?

**Bottom line:** Persuasion is helping people say yes to what's good for them. Manipulation is making them say yes to what's good for you.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "You now have powerful tools. Use them responsibly."
- "Cialdini: 'With great power comes great responsibility' (yes, he actually quotes Spider-Man)"

**Key Points:**
- Persuasion helps audiences overcome irrational resistance to beneficial changes
- Manipulation exploits psychological vulnerabilities for selfish gain
- Vietnamese business culture: Trust and relationships are long-term—manipulation destroys both
- Transparency test: If you had to explain your persuasion techniques, would you be proud or ashamed?

**Example - Ethical:**
- Using Scarcity because budget really does close Friday ✅
- Using Social Proof because other teams genuinely succeeded ✅
- Using Authority by citing real research ✅

**Example - Unethical:**
- Creating fake scarcity ("I'm telling you budget closes but it doesn't") ❌
- Fabricating social proof ("Everyone is doing this" when they're not) ❌
- Cherry-picking data to hide problems ❌

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about your proposal. Honest question: Are you highlighting genuine benefits or overselling?"
- "If overselling, your credibility is at risk. Be honest now, persuasive always."

**Transition:**
- "Let's wrap up with your key takeaways..."

## WRAP-UP SECTION (5 slides)

### Slide 26: Key Takeaways
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Key Takeaways

**1. Balance Aristotle's Three Appeals**
Ethos (credibility) + Pathos (emotion) + Logos (logic) = Persuasive foundation

**2. Apply Cialdini's Principles Intentionally**
Reciprocity, Commitment, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity, Unity—use ethically

**3. Make Ideas Stick with SUCCESs**
Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories—3+ principles per message

**4. Structure Change Narratives**
Understand simply → Honor past → Articulate mandate → Rigorous optimistic path

**5. Design Specific CTAs**
Specific, measurable, time-bound, single action, easy to execute

**6. Stay Ethical**
Persuasion helps; manipulation harms. Choose long-term credibility over short-term wins.

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Six takeaways—each one should appear in your Persuasive Proposal"

**Key Points:**
- Review each takeaway briefly (don't repeat full content, just reinforce)
- Emphasize integration: These frameworks work together, not in isolation
- Proposal checklist: Ethos/pathos/logos balanced? 2+ Cialdini principles? 3+ SUCCESs principles? Clear CTA?

**Example:**
- Excellent proposals use all 6: Credible author (Ethos), emotional story (Pathos), data-backed (Logos), social proof (Cialdini), simple concrete message (SUCCESs), specific ask (CTA)
- Weak proposals: Just logos (data dump) with vague ending

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which takeaway feels newest or most useful to you?"
- "Which one will you apply first in your proposal revision?"

**Transition:**
- "Speaking of your proposal—let's preview what's due..."

---

- Opening hook: Use Unexpected or Concrete from SUCCESs
- Balanced appeals: Don't be all logos—include story (pathos) and citations (ethos)
- Cialdini principles: Must be identifiable—if grader can't spot them, you didn't use them clearly
- SCQA structure: Situation → Complication → Question → Answer (from Week 3)
- Story: Real person affected by problem/solution
- CTA: Specific action, deadline, easy to execute

**Example:**
- "Approve implementation of FlexWork policy for Product Development team (30 employees) by November 30, with pilot starting January 2026"
- NOT: "I hope you'll consider implementing flexible work"

**Check Understanding:**
