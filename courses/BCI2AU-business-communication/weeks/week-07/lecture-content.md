# Persuasive Presentations

**Inspiring Action Through Storytelling**

<speaker-notes>
Welcome to Week 7. Today we explore how to move audiences from passive listening to active commitment through evidence-based persuasion techniques. This week connects directly to your Persuasive Proposal due this week - the frameworks we study today apply equally to written and oral communication.

# 73%

**of employees don't trust their manager's communication**

*(Edelman Trust Barometer, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
This statistic typically surprises students - in an era of constant communication, why is trust declining? The answer lies in how we communicate, not just what we say. Common student questions: "Is this global?" (Yes, across 28 markets) and "What industries are worst?" (Technology and financial services show lowest trust scores).

The implication: Persuasion without credibility is manipulation. Today we learn frameworks that build genuine influence through ethical persuasion.

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** Aristotle's three rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos) to analyze and construct persuasive messages
2. **Identify** Cialdini's seven principles of persuasion in business communication contexts
3. **Construct** persuasive narratives using the SUCCESs framework for memorable, actionable messages
4. **Evaluate** the ethical boundaries between influence and manipulation

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are directly testable on the Week 11 quiz and immediately applicable to your Persuasive Proposal due this week. Connect each objective to the assessment:

- Objective 1 helps you balance credibility, emotion, and logic in your proposal
- Objective 2 provides specific persuasion techniques for your argument
- Objective 3 ensures your message sticks with decision-makers
- Objective 4 maintains professional integrity in your persuasive writing

Tutorial today: You'll apply these frameworks to draft your proposal opening paragraph.

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You

**Persuasive Proposal (Due Week 7 - Sunday 11:59 PM):** 1000-1500 word formal proposal applying persuasion frameworks

**Today's frameworks → Your proposal:**
- **Aristotle's Appeals:** Balance ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), logos (data) in your argument
- **Cialdini's Principles:** Apply 3+ principles explicitly in your proposal
- **SUCCESs Model:** Make your message memorable and actionable

**Tutorial this week:** Draft your opening paragraph using ethos-pathos-logos balance and at least 2 Cialdini principles

<speaker-notes>
Students appreciate seeing the direct connection between lecture and assessment. Emphasize that the assessment rubric specifically asks for "application of at least 3 Cialdini principles (explicitly identified)" - so today's lecture teaches exactly what's being graded.

Remind students: Proposals are due Sunday night this week. Tutorial today gives them structured time to work on the opening with peer feedback before final submission.

# Part 1: Classical Rhetoric

**The Foundation of Persuasion**

<speaker-notes>
Transition from roadmap: "Let's begin with the oldest persuasion framework in Western thought - and still the most useful. Aristotle identified three appeals in 350 BCE, and every effective presentation you've ever seen uses all three."

Preview: We'll see how ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic) work together, and why imbalance hurts your message.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Aristotle's Three Appeals">

## Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals

| Appeal | Definition | Presentation Elements | Example |
|--------|------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Ethos** | Speaker credibility and trustworthiness | Credentials, audience understanding, appropriate tone | "As MIT research shows..." |
| **Pathos** | Emotional resonance with audience | Stories, images, metaphors, vivid language | "Imagine your team with 3 extra hours per week..." |
| **Logos** | Logical evidence and reasoning | Statistics, charts, research citations, diagrams | "30% efficiency gain = $2.4M annual savings" |

**Key insight:** All three are required. Overuse any single appeal and you lose credibility.

<speaker-notes>
This table is the foundation for analyzing any persuasive message - written or oral. Nancy Duarte (presentation expert who created Al Gore's slides) says: "Being too geeky or too expressive creates a chasm between you and the audience."

Ethos answers: "Why should I trust you?" - Establish this first or audience won't engage.
Pathos answers: "Why should I care?" - Logic convinces intellectually; emotion spurs action.
Logos answers: "Is this argument sound?" - Without logic, you're seen as manipulative.

Common mistake: Business students over-rely on logos (data dumps) and ignore pathos. Engineers do the opposite. Great communicators balance all three strategically based on audience analysis.

You could draw three overlapping circles on a whiteboard labeled Ethos, Pathos, Logos with "Persuasion" in the center where all three intersect - this visual shows they work together.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" title="Balancing Appeals">

## The Credibility Gap: Too Analytical or Too Emotional

**Too analytical (all logos):**
- Drowns audience in data without connection
- "Here are 47 charts showing productivity metrics..."
- Intellectually convincing but doesn't inspire action

**Too emotional (all pathos):**
- Feels manipulative without evidence
- "This will transform everything! Trust me!"
- Generates skepticism: "Where's the proof?"

**Balanced approach:**
- Lead with ethos (establish credibility)
- Support with logos (data and logic)
- Connect with pathos (why it matters to them)
- Close with logos + pathos (specific next step)

<speaker-notes>
This is where Nancy Duarte's 2024 MIT Sloan article provides practical guidance: "If you don't take time to understand your audience, you risk creating an imbalance that hurts your credibility."

Exercise for students to try mentally: Think of the worst presentation you've ever seen. Was it too many bullet points with no story (all logos)? Or all inspirational quotes with no substance (all pathos)? Most bad presentations are unbalanced.

Practical application for proposals: Your opening paragraph should establish ethos ("I've researched this thoroughly"), your body should be mostly logos ("Here's the evidence"), but your conclusion needs pathos ("Here's what this means for our team's future").

Vietnamese cultural note: Vietnamese business culture tends toward formal, data-heavy presentations (logos-heavy). Adding appropriate pathos - stories about people, impact on teams - can differentiate your communication.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Ethos-Pathos-Logos in Action">

## Example: Budget Proposal Opening

**Weak (Logos only):**
> "I request $15,000 for training. Industry data shows 200% ROI on leadership development."

**Strong (Balanced):**
> "Last quarter, we lost two high-potential managers to competitors offering leadership development (Pathos - emotional impact). Industry research shows leadership training delivers 200% ROI within 18 months (Logos - evidence). I've researched three proven programs from top business schools (Ethos - credibility) and recommend a $15,000 investment that will pay for itself by Q4 2026."

**What changed:**
- Added human impact (why we should care)
- Established speaker credibility (thorough research)
- Kept the data but contextualized it

<speaker-notes>
Walk through the balanced example sentence by sentence, labeling each appeal:

"Last quarter we lost two managers..." = Pathos (you can feel the loss, it's concrete)
"Industry research shows 200% ROI..." = Logos (data backs the claim)
"I've researched three proven programs..." = Ethos (I'm credible; I've done the homework)
"$15,000 investment that pays for itself..." = Logos + Pathos (logical calculation + positive framing)

Key teaching point: The weak version has good data but doesn't connect emotionally. The strong version uses the same data but wraps it in human context and demonstrates speaker preparation.

Ask students: "Which version would you approve if you were the CFO?" Most will choose the balanced version because it gives them both rational justification (logos) and emotional motivation (pathos) while trusting the speaker (ethos).

Connection to Persuasive Proposal: Your executive summary should follow this exact pattern - problem with human impact, data supporting solution, your credibility as proposer.

# Part 2: Psychology of Persuasion

**The Science of Influence**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "Aristotle gave us the foundation 2,300 years ago. Now let's add modern psychological research. Robert Cialdini spent 35 years studying why people say 'yes' - and identified seven automatic triggers that bypass analytical thinking."

These aren't manipulation tricks - they're hardwired psychological patterns. Understanding them helps you persuade ethically AND defend yourself against unethical influence.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="Cialdini's Seven Principles">

## Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion

Seven psychological triggers that activate automatic compliance:

1. **Reciprocity** - People feel obligated to return favors
2. **Commitment/Consistency** - People align behavior with past commitments
3. **Social Proof** - People follow what similar others do
4. **Authority** - People defer to credible experts
5. **Liking** - People say yes to those they like
6. **Scarcity** - People value what's rare or diminishing
7. **Unity** - People influenced by shared group identity

**Why they work:** Each principle activates mental shortcuts that bypass analytical thinking in increasingly overloaded lives.

<speaker-notes>
These seven principles are THE most cited persuasion framework in business. *Influence* has sold 7+ million copies and has 56,000+ academic citations. Assigned at Stanford GSB for 25+ years.

Key Cialdini quote to share: "In the increasingly overloaded lives we lead, more than ever we need shortcuts or rules of thumb to guide our decision-making." These principles ARE those shortcuts - they're automatic responses our brains developed to save cognitive energy.

IMPORTANT: All seven work cross-culturally, but their relative strength varies. Social Proof and Authority are particularly strong in Vietnamese culture (collectivist, high power distance). Scarcity works universally.

Unity is Cialdini's newest addition (2021 edition) - the "us vs. them" trigger. Especially relevant in team communication and organizational change.

Students often ask: "Is this manipulation?" Answer: Not if you're persuading people toward genuine benefits. These principles explain HOW persuasion works - ethics depends on WHAT you're persuading them to do and WHY.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Reciprocity in Practice">

## Principle 1: Reciprocity

**Definition:** People feel obligated to return favors - even small, unsolicited ones.

**Research evidence:**
- Restaurant study: Tips increased 3% with one mint, 14% with two mints
- Most powerful: 23% increase with personalized delivery ("These are for you")
- MBA negotiations: Exchanging personal information first → 90% agreement vs. 55% without rapport

**Business applications:**
- Free trials, samples, consultations before asking for business
- Sharing valuable insights before requesting meeting
- Offering help to colleagues before asking for assistance

**Ethical use:** Provide genuine value, not manipulative "gifts"

<speaker-notes>
Reciprocity is Cialdini's most powerful principle - it's universal across all cultures studied. The key is that the favor comes FIRST and feels genuine, not transactional.

The mint study is fascinating: One mint = 3% increase (small reciprocity). Two mints = 14% increase (bigger favor, bigger obligation). But the 23% increase came from personalized delivery - the server walked away, came back, said "For you nice people, here's an extra mint." The personalization made it feel like a personal favor, triggering stronger reciprocity.

Vietnamese business culture note: Gift-giving is deeply embedded in Vietnamese business relationships. This is reciprocity at work culturally - relationships are built through exchange. However, Western readers might misinterpret this as bribery, so be careful how you frame reciprocity in international contexts.

For Persuasive Proposal: You could use reciprocity by demonstrating the research you've already done (giving value upfront) before asking for budget approval. "I've already analyzed three vendors and negotiated preliminary quotes" shows you've invested effort before asking for investment.

Warning: Manipulative reciprocity feels icky and backfires. Example: "I sent you this unrequested gift, now buy my product" creates resentment, not obligation. Genuine reciprocity builds relationships; transactional reciprocity damages them.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" title="Commitment and Consistency">

## Principle 2: Commitment and Consistency

**Definition:** People align future behavior with past commitments, especially public or written ones.

**Research evidence:**
- Written commitments: Medical appointment no-shows dropped 18% when patients wrote appointment on card themselves vs. receptionist writing it
- Public commitments: Weight loss groups with public goals lost 3x more weight than private goal groups
- Small commitments lead to larger ones (foot-in-the-door technique)

**Business applications:**
- "Can you commit to trying this for 30 days?"
- Getting verbal agreement to principles before proposing solution
- Asking for small initial commitment that leads to larger ones
- Referencing past decisions: "As we agreed in Q1..."

**Ethical use:** Commitments must be voluntary and aligned with genuine interests

<speaker-notes>
Consistency is deeply psychological - we want to see ourselves as consistent because inconsistency feels uncomfortable (cognitive dissonance). Once we commit to something, especially publicly or in writing, we feel internal pressure to follow through.

The medical appointment study demonstrates this brilliantly: When the receptionist filled out the appointment card, patients felt no ownership. When patients wrote their own appointment time, they'd made a micro-commitment in writing - no-shows dropped 18%. Same information, different commitment level.

Vietnamese cultural context: "Saving face" (thể diện) makes public commitments particularly powerful in Vietnamese culture. Once someone has publicly committed, breaking that commitment creates stronger social shame than in individualistic cultures.

Business application: In negotiations, get agreement on principles first ("We both want a solution that's fair to both parties, correct?"). Once they've committed to fairness, they'll feel pressure to be consistent with that commitment when you propose specific terms.

For Persuasive Proposal: Reference past organizational commitments. "Our 2025 strategic plan committed to developing internal talent. This training program aligns with that commitment." You're holding the organization accountable to its own stated values.

Warning: Exploiting consistency through bait-and-switch (getting small commitment then demanding larger one) is manipulation. Example: "Just sign here to get information" → "Now you've signed, you owe us X." Ethical use requires genuine alignment between initial and subsequent commitments.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="Social Proof in Practice">

## Principle 3: Social Proof

**Definition:** People follow what similar others do, especially under uncertainty.

**Research evidence:**
- Hotel towel reuse: Standard sign = 35% compliance
- "75% of guests in this room reused towels" = 49% compliance (+33% increase)
- Most powerful when the "proof" comes from similar others

**Business applications:**
- "Join 50,000+ companies using our platform"
- Customer testimonials from similar industries
- "Your competitors are already implementing this"
- Case studies from peer organizations

**Ethical boundary:** Truthful social proof only - fabricated testimonials are manipulation

<speaker-notes>
Social Proof is especially powerful in Vietnamese culture (collectivist society, high on Hofstede's Collectivism dimension). "What are others doing?" is a natural decision-making question in group-oriented cultures.

The hotel towel study is brilliant experimental design: Same hotel, same rooms, only changed the wording on the card. Standard environmental message ("Help save the planet") = 35% reuse. Specific social proof ("75% of guests in THIS room reused") = 49% reuse. The specificity matters - "this room" makes the comparison group more similar to you.

Why it works psychologically: Under uncertainty, we assume others know something we don't. If everyone else is doing it, it must be safe/correct. This is efficient decision-making most of the time, but can lead us astray (example: financial bubbles, where "everyone's buying" drives irrational behavior).

For Persuasive Proposal: Include evidence that similar companies/departments have successfully implemented your idea. "Three departments at [competitor company] implemented this system with 25% productivity gains" is more persuasive than abstract benefits.

Vietnamese e-commerce example: Shopee and Lazada heavily use social proof - "X people bought this today," "Y% positive reviews," countdown timers showing demand. These platforms understand that Vietnamese consumers are strongly influenced by what others are buying.

Caution: Fake reviews, fabricated testimonials, inflated numbers = manipulation and illegal in many jurisdictions. Social proof must be truthful to be ethical.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="Authority in Practice">

## Principle 4: Authority

**Definition:** People defer to credible experts and legitimate authority figures.

**Research evidence:**
- Milgram experiments: 65% followed researcher instructions (ethically problematic study)
- Hospital study: Nurses followed doctor's orders even when medically inappropriate
- Modern research: Citing sources increases persuasiveness by 40%

**Business applications:**
- "Harvard research shows..."
- Expert credentials and certifications
- Third-party endorsements
- Data from authoritative sources

**Authority = Aristotle's Ethos:** This is where psychology validates classical rhetoric

<speaker-notes>
Authority is essentially modern psychological validation of Aristotle's ethos (credibility appeal). Cialdini's research shows we're hardwired to defer to experts - it's usually adaptive (doctors know medicine better than we do), but can be exploited.

The Milgram experiments (1961) are one of the most famous and controversial psychology studies ever conducted. Participants were told by a researcher in a white coat to administer electric shocks to another person. 65% continued to maximum voltage despite hearing screams of pain - because an authority figure told them to. (Note: The shocks were fake, but participants believed they were real. This study would never pass modern ethics review.) The lesson: We're shockingly obedient to perceived authority.

Vietnamese cultural dimension: Vietnam scores high on Hofstede's Power Distance Index (score of 70), meaning Vietnamese culture has strong respect for hierarchy and authority. Quoting senior leaders, established experts, or prestigious institutions (Harvard, MIT, WHO) carries extra weight in Vietnamese business contexts compared to low-power-distance cultures like Denmark (18).

For Persuasive Proposal: Cite authoritative sources throughout. "According to McKinsey research..." or "MIT Sloan Management Review found..." adds weight to your arguments. Your credibility increases when you demonstrate you've consulted credible experts.

Modern research on source citation: Petty & Cacioppo's Elaboration Likelihood Model research found that citing sources increases message persuasiveness by approximately 40% - people assume cited claims are more truthful even when they don't verify the sources.

Ethical use: Cite real experts accurately. Misrepresenting credentials ("As a Harvard study shows..." when it's actually a blog post) or fake experts (Dr. Oz selling miracle supplements) is manipulation. Authority should be legitimate and relevant to the claim.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Liking in Practice">

## Principle 5: Liking

**Definition:** People say yes to those they like - based on similarity, compliments, cooperation, and attractiveness.

**Research evidence:**
- Sales negotiations: Finding common ground before negotiating increased agreement rates by 90%
- MBA study: Participants who spent 5 minutes finding similarities before negotiating reached 90% agreement vs. 55% for those who negotiated immediately
- Compliments increase compliance even when obviously self-serving

**Business applications:**
- Finding common ground before making requests
- Building rapport through genuine compliments
- Cooperative framing: "Let's solve this together"
- Physical attractiveness in customer-facing roles (ethical concerns)

**Four pathways to liking:**
1. **Similarity:** "We're both from the same industry"
2. **Compliments:** "Your presentation last week was insightful"
3. **Cooperation:** "Let's work together on this"
4. **Association:** Linking yourself to positive things

**Ethical use:** Genuine connection, not fake flattery

<speaker-notes>
Liking seems obvious - of course we say yes to people we like - but the research shows how powerful and automatic this principle is. Even obvious flattery works if it's not insultingly transparent.

The MBA negotiation study is remarkable: Same negotiation scenario, same stakes, same information. Only difference - one group spent 5 minutes chatting informally to find commonalities ("Where are you from?" "What did you study?" "What are your hobbies?") before negotiating. That 5-minute investment in rapport building nearly doubled the agreement rate from 55% to 90%.

The four pathways work differently across cultures:
- **Similarity:** Universal - we trust people like us
- **Compliments:** Very powerful in Vietnamese culture (showing respect, but must be genuine to avoid losing face)
- **Cooperation:** Especially effective in collectivist cultures
- **Association:** Works everywhere (celebrity endorsements, prestige brands)

Vietnamese business context: Relationship-building (quan hệ) is essential in Vietnamese business culture. Western executives often make the mistake of "getting down to business" immediately. Vietnamese culture expects relationship-building first - meals together, learning about families, finding connections. This is the Liking principle embedded culturally.

For Persuasive Proposal: Acknowledge contributions of stakeholders genuinely. "The finance team's cost analysis last quarter highlighted this opportunity" shows you've paid attention and creates goodwill. Find common ground with decision-makers.

Warning: Fake rapport destroys trust. Insincere compliments, manufactured similarity, surface-level schmoozing - people detect these quickly and become more resistant. Liking must be authentic to work ethically and sustainably.

Quick teaching moment: "How many of you have bought something from a salesperson you liked, even though a competitor had a better product or price?" Most hands go up. That's Liking at work.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="Scarcity in Practice">

## Principle 6: Scarcity

**Definition:** People value what's rare or diminishing - loss aversion drives urgency.

**Research evidence:**
- British Airways Concorde: Sales surged AFTER discontinuation announced
- Job applicants: 3-day response deadline doubled acceptance rates vs. open deadline
- Based on Kahneman's loss aversion: Fear of losing > Desire for gaining

**Business applications:**
- Limited-time offers with specific deadlines
- "Only 3 spots remaining in the program"
- Exclusive access for early adopters
- Discontinuation announcements drive demand

**Ethical use:** Real scarcity only - artificial urgency is manipulation

<speaker-notes>
Scarcity taps into loss aversion, one of the most powerful psychological biases documented by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. Psychologically, losing $100 feels roughly twice as bad as gaining $100 feels good. This asymmetry makes "last chance" framing incredibly powerful.

The British Airways Concorde case is the classic example: When BA announced Concorde would be discontinued, sales went from weak to sold out overnight. People who had no interest in flying Concorde suddenly desperately wanted it because it was going away. This is pure scarcity psychology - we want what we can't have.

Vietnamese e-commerce aggressively uses scarcity: Countdown timers on Shopee flash sales, "only 5 left in stock" warnings on Lazada, limited-edition product releases. These platforms understand that scarcity drives immediate action in ways that static "good price" messaging cannot.

For Persuasive Proposal: Frame your request with genuine scarcity - "If we don't act by Q2, we'll miss the annual vendor discount window" or "Our top competitor just announced they're implementing this system - we have a 6-month window to catch up." Real deadlines create urgency; fake ones create resentment.

Ethical boundary: Real scarcity is persuasive. Artificial scarcity is manipulation. Example: "Sale ends tonight!" (but the same sale runs every week) trains customers to distrust you. Example: "Limited edition" products that get re-released constantly. These tactics work short-term but destroy credibility long-term.

Quick engagement question: "Show of hands - who's bought something because of a countdown timer or 'limited stock' warning?" Most students will raise hands, validating how powerful scarcity is in real-world purchasing decisions.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Unity in Practice">

## Principle 7: Unity

**Definition:** People are influenced by shared identity - "us" vs. "them" thinking drives cooperation and loyalty.

**Research evidence:**
- Team identity manipulation: Participants 50% more likely to help someone wearing same-colored wristband
- Charity donations: Appeals emphasizing "we're all human" vs. specific identity ("we're all parents") - specific identity increased donations by 35%
- Unity > Similarity: Shared identity ("we ARE the same") stronger than similarity ("we're LIKE each other")

**Business applications:**
- "As members of this department..."
- "We're all invested in this company's success"
- Team identity language: "Our team," "We believe," "Together we"
- Emphasizing shared goals, values, or challenges

**Two types of unity:**
1. **Acting together:** Shared experiences (same team, same company, same project)
2. **Being together:** Shared identity (same profession, same nationality, same values)

**Ethical use:** Build genuine communities, not manipulate tribal instincts

<speaker-notes>
Unity is Cialdini's newest principle, added in the 2021 7th edition of *Influence*. It goes beyond Liking - Liking is "I like you because we're similar," Unity is "You are one of us."

The distinction matters: Similarity = "We both play tennis" (we have things in common). Unity = "We're both tennis players" (we share an identity). The identity framing creates stronger bonds and compliance.

The wristband study demonstrates how trivial shared markers can create powerful in-group loyalty. Researchers randomly assigned colored wristbands (red or blue) and told participants they were on the "red team" or "blue team." When later asked to help another participant, they were 50% more likely to help someone with the same colored wristband. The groups were completely random and meaningless, yet "us vs. them" thinking activated immediately.

Vietnamese cultural context: Collectivist cultures like Vietnam have strong in-group/out-group distinctions. Family (gia đình), hometown (quê hương), school connections (cựu học sinh) create powerful unity bonds. Establishing shared identity opens doors in Vietnamese business contexts.

For Persuasive Proposal: Use inclusive language throughout. Not "I propose we implement..." but "As a department committed to innovation, we have an opportunity to..." Frame your proposal as an extension of shared identity and values.

Business application examples:
- Apple's "Think Different" campaign - created identity-based community, not just product features
- Harley-Davidson - sells identity ("I'm a Harley rider"), not just motorcycles
- Patagonia - environmental identity drives extreme customer loyalty

Warning: Unity can be manipulated for harmful purposes - nationalism, tribalism, cult behavior. Ethical use builds genuine communities around shared positive values. Unethical use exploits tribal instincts to create division and conformity.

The "we're all in this together" language during COVID-19 was Unity messaging - effective for compliance with public health measures when used honestly, manipulative when used to excuse poor policies.

# Part 3: Sticky Storytelling

**Making Ideas Memorable and Actionable**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "We've covered what makes messages credible and persuasive. Now the final piece: How do you make your message stick? You can have perfect ethos-pathos-logos balance and all seven Cialdini principles, but if your audience forgets your message by tomorrow, you've failed."

Enter Chip and Dan Heath's SUCCESs framework - why some ideas survive and others die. Chip Heath is a Stanford GSB professor, and this framework is assigned at Harvard, Wharton, and Cornell business schools.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="framework" title="SUCCESs Framework">

## Made to Stick: The SUCCESs Model

Six principles that make ideas "sticky" - memorable and actionable:

- **S - Simple:** Strip to core; find single most important element
- **U - Unexpected:** Violate expectations; create "curiosity gaps"
- **C - Concrete:** Use vivid, tangible details vs. abstractions
- **C - Credible:** Build trust through sources, details, or testable claims
- **E - Emotional:** Connect to personal identity and self-interest
- **S - Stories:** Narratives as vicarious experience that drive action

**Why it works:** Each principle addresses a barrier to communication - attention, memory, or action.

<speaker-notes>
The SUCCESs acronym is itself an example of the Simple principle - easy to remember. This framework explains why some messages go viral while others are forgotten immediately.

Each principle solves a specific problem:
- Simple = fights information overload ("What's the ONE thing?")
- Unexpected = grabs attention (our brains notice violations of patterns)
- Concrete = aids memory (abstract concepts fade; vivid details stick)
- Credible = overcomes skepticism (we need reasons to believe)
- Emotional = drives action (logic convinces head; emotion moves feet)
- Stories = provide context (narratives are "flight simulators for the brain")

The Heath brothers spent years studying "sticky" ideas - urban legends, conspiracy theories, advertising slogans, successful change campaigns. What made some ideas spread while others died? These six principles appeared consistently.

Example of all six working together: "Don't Mess with Texas" anti-litter campaign achieved 73% awareness and 72% litter reduction. Simple (3-word slogan), Unexpected (anti-litter campaign using tough language), Concrete (specific behavior - don't litter), Credible (Texas celebrities in ads), Emotional (Texas pride identity), Stories (ads showed real Texans).

For Persuasive Proposal: Your executive summary should be Simple (one clear recommendation), your problem statement should be Concrete (specific examples, not abstract problems), your solution should include Stories (case studies of success elsewhere).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="Simple: The Commander's Intent">

## S - Simple: Finding the Core

**Principle:** Strip message to single most important element - the "Commander's Intent"

**Military example:**
- Bad mission brief: "Execute coordinated multi-phase operation leveraging combined arms doctrine..."
- Good Commander's Intent: "Take the bridge. Hold it until relieved."
- Why it works: When plans fail, soldiers still know the ONE thing that matters

**Business applications:**
- Southwest Airlines: "We are THE low-fare airline"
- Your proposal: What's the single sentence version?

**Key insight:** "Simplicity isn't about dumbing down, it's about prioritizing" - Heath & Heath

<speaker-notes>
Commander's Intent is a U.S. military doctrine specifically designed to combat information overload in combat. Plans never survive contact with the enemy, so commanders learned to communicate the ONE essential objective. Everything else is tactics that can adapt, but the core intent must remain clear.

The brilliance: When radio communications fail, when the situation changes, soldiers can make autonomous decisions because they know the core objective. "Take the bridge and hold it" is simple enough to remember under extreme stress and clear enough to guide improvisation.

Business parallel: Southwest Airlines has maintained "We are THE low-fare airline" as their core identity for 50+ years. Every decision - which routes to fly, whether to serve meals, which planes to buy - filters through this simple principle. Herb Kelleher (founder) said: "I can teach you the Southwest strategy in 30 seconds: We are the low-fare airline. Period."

For Persuasive Proposal: Before you write 1,000 words, write the one-sentence version. "We should invest $30,000 in leadership training to retain high-potential managers." That's your Commander's Intent - everything else supports that core.

Vietnamese business context: Vietnamese business communication often values comprehensive detail and formal documentation. The Simple principle might feel uncomfortably blunt. However, decision-makers universally appreciate knowing the bottom line quickly. Lead with the simple core, THEN provide supporting detail.

Common student question: "But my idea is complex - I can't simplify it to one sentence!" Answer: If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Einstein supposedly said: "If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand it yourself."

<slide number="22" title="Unexpected: Breaking Patterns">

## U - Unexpected: Creating Curiosity Gaps

**Principle:** Violate expectations to grab attention and create curiosity gaps

**The curiosity gap formula:**
1. Identify what audience assumes
2. Violate that assumption with surprising fact
3. Answer the question: "Why?" or "How?"

**Examples:**
- **Expected:** "Our industry is growing"
- **Unexpected:** "Our industry is growing - but our competitors are shrinking. Here's why."

- **Expected:** "This software increases productivity"
- **Unexpected:** "This software will make you work LESS - and accomplish MORE. Here's how."

**Research evidence:**
- Headlines with curiosity gaps had 3x higher click-through rates
- "Mystery" creates knowledge gap that brain craves to fill

**Ethical use:** Deliver on the promise - don't create false curiosity

<speaker-notes>
Unexpected is about pattern violation. Our brains are prediction machines - we notice when reality violates our predictions. That violation grabs attention and creates a knowledge gap we feel compelled to fill.

The curiosity gap concept comes from George Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory: When we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know, we feel psychological tension. The only way to relieve that tension is to fill the gap - we MUST find out the answer.

Classic example: "Doctors hate this one weird trick..." (clickbait headlines). Why does it work? It violates expectations (doctors should like helpful health tips, not hate them) and creates curiosity gap (what's the trick?). The formula is manipulative when it doesn't deliver value, but the psychological mechanism is sound.

Better business example: Our opening statistic today - "73% of employees don't trust their manager's communication." This likely violated your expectation - in an age of communication training and awareness, trust should be high, not low. That violation grabbed attention and created the question: "Why?"

For Persuasive Proposal: Don't open with expected statements ("Our industry faces challenges"). Open with pattern violation: "While our competitors are cutting R&D budgets by 20%, we have an opportunity to increase ours by 15% - here's why this is the right move." The unexpected framing creates attention and curiosity.

Vietnamese cultural note: Vietnamese communication style tends toward indirect, harmonious messaging. Unexpected can feel too direct or confrontational. However, in written business proposals (not public speaking), pattern violation can differentiate your message from dozens of similar proposals. Use unexpected opening, then provide thorough explanation.

Warning: Unexpected without delivery = manipulation. If you create curiosity gap but don't actually have a satisfying answer, you lose trust permanently. Example: "You won't believe what happened next!" (but what happened next is boring). Don't be clickbait.

<slide number="23" title="Concrete: The Power of Vivid Detail">

## C - Concrete: Making Abstractions Tangible

**Abstract (forgettable):**
> "Our proposal will optimize operational efficiency through integrated process improvement."

**Concrete (memorable):**
> "Your team currently spends 4 hours every Friday manually compiling reports. Our system automates this, giving you 200 hours back per year - nearly 5 work weeks."

**Why concrete works:**
- Our brains remember sensory details, not abstractions
- Concrete language creates shared understanding
- Specific numbers are more credible than vague claims

**CSPI example:** "Movie theater popcorn has more fat than a full day's worth of unhealthy eating" - made abstract nutrition data concrete and memorable

<speaker-notes>
This slide demonstrates the principle by showing it - the abstract version sounds like corporate jargon, the concrete version creates a mental picture you can see and feel.

The CSPI (Center for Science in the Public Interest) movie popcorn campaign is one of the best examples of making abstract data concrete. They could have said "Movie popcorn contains 37 grams of saturated fat" - technically accurate but meaningless to most people. Instead: "A medium movie popcorn has more artery-clogging fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, Big Mac and fries for lunch, and steak dinner with all the trimmings COMBINED." Suddenly you can visualize it - and it's disgusting. This is the Concrete principle at work.

Psychology of concrete language: Our brains evolved to process sensory information (sights, sounds, physical objects), not abstractions (efficiency, optimization, synergy). When you say "4 hours every Friday," I can picture someone sitting at their desk on Friday afternoon. When you say "optimize operational efficiency," my brain has nothing to latch onto.

For Persuasive Proposal: Replace every abstraction with a concrete detail:
- Not "improve communication" → "reduce email response time from 48 hours to 4 hours"
- Not "enhance productivity" → "complete month-end reports in 2 days instead of 5"
- Not "significant savings" → "$47,000 annual cost reduction"

Vietnamese business communication often uses formal, abstract language to sound professional. Fight this instinct - concrete details increase credibility and memory in every culture. You can be both professional AND concrete.

Quick check: Read your proposal aloud. Can you visualize what you're describing? If not, add concrete details.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" title="Credible: Building Believability">

## C - Credible: Sources of Trust

**Five credibility sources (when you lack authority):**

1. **Authority credentials:** "According to Stanford research..."
2. **Anti-authority credentials:** "I used to be a skeptic until..."
3. **Vivid details:** Specific details signal insider knowledge
4. **Statistics:** But make them human-scale, not abstract
5. **Testable claims:** "Try it yourself and see"

**The Sinatra Test:** "If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere"
- One impressive credential proves all: If you catered the White House, you can cater my wedding
- Find your "Sinatra credential" - the one thing that proves everything

**Human-scale statistics:**
- **Abstract:** "1 in 1,000,000 people"
- **Human-scale:** "In a city the size of Hanoi (8M people), that's 8 people"

<speaker-notes>
Credible addresses the fundamental question: "Why should I believe you?" Even if you're not an expert, these five sources build credibility.

**Anti-authority credentials** are particularly powerful: "I used to think this was nonsense too, until..." This works because it shows you overcame the exact skepticism your audience feels. Ronald Reagan's conversion from Democrat to Republican made his conservative credentials stronger - he'd seen both sides.

**Vivid details** signal insider knowledge. When someone says "The restaurant has a blue door on the left side, ring twice, and ask for Mario," those specific details signal they've actually been there. Apply this to proposals: "The system requires 3-4 hours initial setup on a Tuesday afternoon when traffic is lowest, then runs automatically on weekends." Specificity = credibility.

**Human-scale statistics** make big numbers meaningful. Bill Gates used this beautifully: Instead of "40 million people lack access to banking," he said "That's more than the entire population of California." Suddenly the number has meaning.

The **Sinatra Test** (named after the song "New York, New York") means one credential that's SO impressive it proves everything else. Examples:
- "We've designed systems for NASA" (if you can handle NASA requirements, you can handle mine)
- "We trained executives at Google, Amazon, and Microsoft" (if they trust you, I should too)

For Persuasive Proposal: Find your Sinatra credential. What's the ONE thing you can cite that proves your proposal is credible? A competitor who succeeded with similar approach? A prestigious institution's research? A successful pilot program?

Vietnamese business context: Authority credentials (prestigious universities, well-known companies) carry significant weight in Vietnamese culture. If you have them, use them upfront. If you don't, use testable claims ("The pilot program is running in Department X - visit and see results yourself").

Testable claims are powerful because they shift burden of proof: "Don't take my word for it - try it for 30 days and measure results yourself." You're inviting verification, which builds trust.

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Emotional: Beyond Self-Interest">

## E - Emotional: Making People Care

**Beyond features and benefits - connect to identity and values**

**Three emotional appeals:**
1. **Self-interest:** "What's in it for ME?"
2. **Identity:** "What does this say about who I AM?"
3. **Collective good:** "What does this mean for US?"

**The "semantic stretch" problem:**
- Telling people "malaria kills millions" doesn't drive action
- Telling people "this ONE child has malaria" does drive action
- Psychology: We feel individuals, not statistics

**Mother Teresa:** "If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will."

**For business:** Connect your proposal to personal values and team identity, not just ROI

<speaker-notes>
Emotional is where many business communicators fail - they think emotion has no place in professional communication. Wrong. Emotion drives action; logic justifies it after the fact.

The key insight: Move beyond self-interest (WIIFM - What's In It For Me) to identity (What does this say about who I am?) and collective good (What does this mean for us?).

Example:
- Self-interest appeal: "This training will make you more promotable"
- Identity appeal: "This training develops you into the leader you want to become"
- Collective good appeal: "This training strengthens our team's capability to tackle bigger challenges"

All three are about the same training program, but they connect to different motivations. Identity and collective good are often MORE powerful than self-interest, especially in collectivist cultures like Vietnam.

The "semantic stretch" problem comes from psychologist Paul Slovic's research on charity donations. Statistics about millions suffering don't drive action - they're too abstract. But a story about ONE person with a name, face, and specific situation drives massive action. Why? Our empathy systems evolved to respond to individuals, not masses.

Mother Teresa understood this: "If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will." She built her entire organization around this principle - help one person at a time, tell individual stories, make suffering concrete and personal.

For Persuasive Proposal: Don't just cite ROI statistics. Tell the story of ONE employee who struggled with the problem you're solving. "Sarah in accounting spends 6 hours every month manually reconciling reports - time she could spend on analysis." Sarah becomes real; 6 hours becomes meaningful.

Vietnamese cultural context: Collective good appeals are particularly powerful in Vietnamese culture. "This benefits our department's reputation" or "This strengthens our competitive position" resonates more than pure individual benefit.

The Texas pride example from "Don't Mess with Texas" - they didn't appeal to self-interest ("littering might cause a fine") or logic ("littering harms the environment"). They appealed to identity: "Real Texans don't litter. Don't mess with Texas." Identity drove 72% litter reduction.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="Stories: The Flight Simulator">

## S - Stories: Narratives Drive Action

**Why stories work:**
- "Stories are flight simulators for the brain" - let people experience vicariously
- Narratives activate more brain regions than facts alone
- Stories provide context for applying knowledge

**Three plot types that inspire action:**
1. **Challenge:** Overcoming obstacles (David vs. Goliath)
2. **Connection:** Bridging differences (Good Samaritan)
3. **Creativity:** Solving problems in novel ways (MacGyver)

**Business storytelling:** Case studies, customer success stories, transformation narratives

**Example:** Subway's Jared story (man loses 245 pounds eating Subway) - made weight loss concrete and believable through personal narrative

<speaker-notes>
"Stories are flight simulators for the brain" is one of the Heath brothers' most powerful metaphors. Pilots use flight simulators to practice emergency scenarios without crashing real planes. Stories do the same for decision-making - they let us experience situations vicariously and learn from them.

Neuroscience research (Uri Hasson, Princeton) shows that stories activate the listener's brain in the same patterns as the storyteller's brain - "neural coupling." When I tell you about my experience, your brain simulates having that experience yourself. Facts and statistics don't create this coupling - only narratives do.

The three plot types work because they're universal human stories:
- Challenge = "Can we overcome this obstacle?" (inspires courage and persistence)
- Connection = "Can we bridge this difference?" (inspires empathy and collaboration)
- Creativity = "Can we solve this in a new way?" (inspires innovation)

Subway's Jared story (1999-2015) is a perfect example of all SUCCESs principles working together:
- Simple: Lost weight eating Subway
- Unexpected: Fast food helping weight loss?
- Concrete: 245 pounds lost, size 60 to size 34 jeans
- Credible: Real person, documented journey
- Emotional: Personal transformation anyone can relate to
- Story: Clear before/after narrative arc

For Persuasive Proposal: Include a brief case study or customer story. Not just "Company X implemented this with good results" but "Company X was facing [problem similar to ours]. They implemented [solution]. Within 6 months, [specific outcome]. Their COO said: '[quote about impact]'." This narrative structure makes your proposal memorable and provides a mental model for success.

Vietnamese business culture note: Storytelling is deeply valued in Vietnamese culture (oral tradition, proverbs, historical narratives). However, business presentations often default to data-heavy slides. You can differentiate yourself by weaving narratives into your business communication while maintaining professional credibility.

Warning: Stories must be truthful. Fabricated case studies or embellished results destroy credibility permanently. The story of Jared ended badly (legal issues unrelated to weight loss) which damaged Subway's campaign, but the storytelling technique itself remains valid.

<slide number="27" title="SUCCESs in Action">

## Case Study: "Don't Mess with Texas"

**Challenge:** Reduce highway litter in Texas (70% of litter from young men who didn't respond to environmental appeals)

**Campaign strategy applying SUCCESs:**
- **Simple:** 3-word slogan
- **Unexpected:** Anti-litter using tough, masculine language (not typical environmental messaging)
- **Concrete:** Specific behavior - don't throw trash out car window
- **Credible:** Texas celebrities (Cowboys players, Willie Nelson) in ads
- **Emotional:** Texas pride identity - "Real Texans don't litter"
- **Stories:** Ads showed real Texans picking up litter, confronting litterers

**Results:**
- 73% awareness within 6 months
- 72% litter reduction over 5 years
- Still running 40 years later

<speaker-notes>
"Don't Mess with Texas" is the gold standard for applying the SUCCESs framework to create behavior change. It demonstrates how all six principles work together synergistically.

The background: Texas spent decades trying to reduce highway litter with typical environmental messaging - "Give a hoot, don't pollute" type campaigns. None worked. Research showed 70% of litter came from young men aged 18-35 who didn't identify with environmental appeals. The Texas Department of Transportation needed a new approach.

The insight: Young Texas men DO care about Texas pride and masculinity. So reframe littering as unpatriotic and unmanly. "Don't Mess with Texas" sounds like a threat, not a lecture. It appeals to Texas identity, not environmental consciousness.

Breaking down the SUCCESs elements:
- **Simple:** Can't get simpler than 3 words. Anyone can remember it.
- **Unexpected:** Anti-litter campaigns usually feature crying Native Americans or cute animals. This one features tough guys saying "Don't mess with us."
- **Concrete:** Not abstract "help the environment" - specific "don't throw trash out your car window on Texas highways"
- **Credible:** Real Texas celebrities (Dallas Cowboys, Willie Nelson, Stevie Ray Vaughan) created authenticity
- **Emotional:** Tapped into powerful Texas pride identity (very strong in-group identity in Texas culture)
- **Stories:** TV ads showed narratives of Texans protecting their state, not just slogans

Results speak for themselves: 73% of Texans recognized the slogan within 6 months. Highway litter dropped 72% over 5 years. The campaign is still running 40 years later and has become a Texas cultural icon.

For Persuasive Proposal: You can apply the same framework. Make your recommendation Simple (one clear ask), make your problem statement Concrete (specific data), include a Story (case study), appeal to Emotion (what this means for team identity), make it Credible (cite authoritative sources), and make it Unexpected (frame in novel way that violates expectations).

The lesson: When environmental appeals failed, identity appeals succeeded. Know your audience and frame your message to connect with what they actually care about.

# Bringing It All Together

**Ethical Persuasion Framework**

<speaker-notes>
Transition: "We've covered three major frameworks - Aristotle's classical rhetoric, Cialdini's psychological principles, and Heath's sticky storytelling. Now the critical question: How do you use these ethically? And how do they work together?"

This final section addresses the most important question: the difference between persuasion and manipulation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="29" layout="framework" title="Ethical Framework">

## The Ethical Persuasion Test

**Ask yourself three questions before using any persuasion technique:**

1. **Truth:** Are my claims factually accurate and fully contextualized?
   - Ethos requires genuine credibility
   - Social proof must be real, not fabricated
   - Stories must be truthful, not embellished

2. **Transparency:** Would this work if the audience knew my techniques?
   - Ethical persuasion survives disclosure
   - Manipulation requires hiding intent

3. **Benefit:** Am I persuading them toward genuine value?
   - Are they better off if they say yes?
   - Would I make this decision for a family member?

**If you answer "no" to any question, you're manipulating, not persuading.**

<speaker-notes>
This ethical framework comes from Cialdini's own writing - he's deeply concerned that his principles are used ethically. He distinguishes "influence" (ethical persuasion toward mutual benefit) from "manipulation" (deceptive persuasion toward one-sided benefit).

Question 1 - Truth: This is foundational. Fabricated social proof, fake scarcity, misleading statistics = manipulation, full stop. Example: "9 out of 10 dentists recommend" (but you surveyed only 10 dentists and cherry-picked the question). Example: "Limited edition" product that gets re-released constantly. These tactics work short-term but destroy trust permanently.

Question 2 - Transparency: This is Cialdini's "disclosure test." Would the technique still work if you told them what you're doing? Ethical persuasion: Yes. "I'm going to cite research because evidence persuades people" - still works when disclosed. Manipulation: No. "I'm creating fake urgency to pressure you" - stops working when disclosed.

Real-world example of transparency: Some sales negotiators openly say "I'm going to use the reciprocity principle by offering you something valuable upfront." This disclosure doesn't diminish the technique's effectiveness because the value is real and mutual.

Question 3 - Benefit: This is the "grandmother test." Would you persuade your grandmother to do this? If you're selling a product you know is inferior, or persuading someone to take an action that benefits you but hurts them, you're manipulating. Ethical persuasion aligns interests - both parties are better off.

Vietnamese business context: Some students may have experienced aggressive sales tactics in Vietnamese markets (fake scarcity, pressure tactics, misleading claims). These techniques work short-term but destroy long-term business relationships. Professional business communication requires trust, which requires ethical persuasion.

For Persuasive Proposal: Your proposal should pass all three tests. Are your claims accurate? Would you still be persuasive if you disclosed your persuasion techniques? Is your proposal genuinely beneficial to the organization, or just to you? If you can't answer yes to all three, revise your approach.

Class discussion prompt: "Can you think of a time someone tried to persuade you and it felt manipulative? Which of these three tests did they fail?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="30" title="Integration Example">

## Example: Persuasive Proposal Opening (All Frameworks Combined)

> "Last year, we lost three senior engineers to competitors offering leadership development programs (Pathos - emotional impact). According to MIT research, companies with structured leadership pipelines have 40% lower voluntary turnover (Logos - credible authority). I've researched five programs used by our industry peers - Google, Microsoft, and Apple all invest $5,000-$8,000 per high-potential employee annually (Social Proof). Our engineering team includes 12 high-potential employees. Investing $60,000 now (Scarcity - limited window before next budget cycle) will save us an estimated $240,000 in replacement costs over two years (Concrete - specific savings). This is our last chance to include this in the current fiscal year budget (Scarcity - genuine deadline)."

**Frameworks applied:**
- Ethos/Pathos/Logos: Balanced credibility, emotion, logic
- Cialdini: Authority (MIT), Social Proof (Google/Microsoft/Apple), Scarcity (budget deadline)
- SUCCESs: Concrete (specific numbers), Simple (clear ask), Credible (MIT + industry peers)

<speaker-notes>
This example demonstrates how all three frameworks work together in a single paragraph. Let's break it down technique by technique:

Sentence 1: "Last year we lost three senior engineers..." = Pathos (emotional impact - we can feel the loss) + Concrete (specific number, not vague "we lost some people"). This opens with human impact, not data.

Sentence 2: "According to MIT research..." = Logos (statistical evidence) + Authority principle (credible source) + Credible (SUCCESs - MIT is credible institution). Notice the specific statistic - "40% lower turnover" is concrete.

Sentence 3: "I've researched five programs..." = Ethos (demonstrates speaker preparation and credibility) + Social Proof (Google, Microsoft, Apple - if they're doing it, it must be valuable) + Concrete (specific companies and dollar amounts).

Sentence 4: "Our engineering team includes 12 high-potential employees..." = Logos (the math: 12 employees × $5,000 = $60,000) + Concrete (specific calculation anyone can verify).

Sentence 5: "...will save us $240,000..." = Logos (ROI calculation) + Concrete (specific savings over specific timeframe). Notice this makes the investment feel small compared to the cost of doing nothing.

Sentence 6: "This is our last chance..." = Scarcity (genuine deadline - current fiscal year budget cycle) + Simple (clear consequence of waiting).

Ethical check:
- Truth? All claims must be verifiable - lost employees, MIT research, competitor programs, replacement cost calculation
- Transparency? Yes - if you explained "I'm using social proof by showing competitors do this," it would still be persuasive
- Benefit? Yes - if leadership development genuinely reduces turnover and develops talent, the organization benefits

What makes this persuasive:
- Opens with emotion (lost engineers) not data
- Balances ethos-pathos-logos throughout
- Uses multiple Cialdini principles layered together
- Extremely concrete (12 employees, $60,000, $240,000, 40%, five programs, three companies)
- Simple bottom line (invest $60K, save $240K)

For your Persuasive Proposal: You should aim for this level of integration. Don't just list Cialdini principles mechanically ("First I'll use reciprocity, then social proof..."). Weave them naturally into compelling narrative that balances all three rhetorical appeals with concrete details.

Common student mistake: Trying to use ALL seven Cialdini principles in every paragraph. That's overkill and feels forced. Choose 2-3 that naturally fit your argument and apply them authentically.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="31" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

**Classical Rhetoric:**
- Balance ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), logos (logic) - imbalance hurts persuasiveness
- Too analytical = convinces but doesn't inspire; Too emotional = inspires but lacks credibility

**Psychological Persuasion:**
- Cialdini's 7 principles are hardwired mental shortcuts - use ethically
- Most powerful: Reciprocity, Social Proof, Scarcity, Unity
- Authority principle = Ethos in modern form

**Sticky Storytelling:**
- SUCCESs framework makes ideas memorable and actionable
- Concrete details stick; abstractions fade
- Stories create vicarious experience that drives action

**Ethics:**
- Truth + Transparency + Benefit = Ethical Persuasion
- If it wouldn't work when disclosed, it's manipulation

<speaker-notes>
Summary of the three major frameworks we've covered today. Emphasize that these aren't separate techniques - they work together synergistically.

Connection to assessment: "Your Persuasive Proposal due Sunday must demonstrate at least 3 Cialdini principles (explicitly identified in your submission), balance rhetorical appeals, and use concrete language throughout. The rubric specifically assesses 'Effective use of Cialdini principles and rhetorical appeals' at 30% of your grade."

Remind students: Tutorial today gives you structured time to apply these frameworks to your proposal opening paragraph with peer feedback. Come prepared to work - bring your proposal scenario and be ready to draft.

Preview next week: Week 8 we move to high-stakes communication and executive presence - how to maintain persuasive communication under pressure, handle difficult questions, and project confidence when the stakes are highest. Today's persuasion frameworks apply there too, but with added challenge of real-time delivery.

Final thought: "Persuasion is a skill that improves with practice. The more you consciously apply these frameworks, the more natural they become. In 5 years, you won't think 'Now I'll use the reciprocity principle' - you'll intuitively balance credibility, emotion, and logic because you've practiced it hundreds of times."

<slide number="32" title="Assessment Reminders">

## This Week's Deliverables

**Due Sunday, Week 7 (11:59 PM):**
- **Persuasive Proposal** (1000-1500 words)
- Must apply 3+ Cialdini principles (explicitly identified)
- Balance ethos-pathos-logos throughout
- Use concrete language and specific examples
- Full requirements: Assessment Handbook, Section 2

**Tutorial Today:**
- Draft opening paragraph (150 words)
- Apply frameworks from today's lecture
- Receive peer feedback before final submission

**Week 7 Quiz:**
- Opens Monday, due Friday 11:59 PM
- Covers today's frameworks: Aristotle, Cialdini, SUCCESs
- 12 questions, 15 minutes

<speaker-notes>
Critical reminders for this week:

Persuasive Proposal is due Sunday - this is one of your highest-weighted portfolio pieces at 15% of final grade. The rubric specifically looks for:
- "Application of at least 3 Cialdini principles (explicitly identified)" - so you must name which principles you're using and where
- "Balanced use of rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos)" - don't be all data or all emotion
- "Concrete, specific examples with evidence" - no vague claims

Tutorial structure today: You'll have 60 minutes to draft your opening paragraph applying today's frameworks. Then 4-6 students will share their drafts and receive peer feedback. Come prepared with your chosen scenario (from Assessment Handbook options A, B, C, or D).

Quiz logistics: The Week 7 quiz tests framework knowledge at Remembering and Understanding levels - definitions, components, distinctions. Example questions: "What are Cialdini's 7 principles?" "How do ethos and logos differ?" "What does the 'C' in SUCCESs stand for?" No scenario analysis on quizzes - that's for tutorials and assessments.

Common student question: "Can I submit my proposal early?" Yes - Moodle accepts early submissions. Many students submit Saturday to avoid Sunday evening technical issues.

Office hours: Available by email or by appointment if you want feedback on your proposal draft before submission. However, I cannot review complete drafts - bring specific questions about framework application or organization.

Encouragement: "This proposal is where you demonstrate mastery of persuasive communication. Apply today's frameworks deliberately, use the tutorial feedback to strengthen your draft, and submit work you're proud of."

## Next Week: High-Stakes Communication

**Week 8: Executive Presence Under Pressure**

- Projecting confidence and credibility in high-stakes contexts
- Handling challenging Q&A and difficult conversations
- Crisis communication fundamentals
- Executive Presence Model (Hewlett)

**Pre-reading:**
- Hewlett, S. A. (2014). *Executive Presence: The Missing Link Between Merit and Success* (Ch. 1-4)
- Argenti, P. A. (2002). Crisis communication: Lessons from 9/11

**Connection:** Today's persuasion frameworks + next week's executive presence = complete persuasive communication toolkit

<speaker-notes>
Preview Week 8 to create continuity: "Today you learned how to persuade through careful message construction. Next week we add the performance element - how to deliver persuasive messages with executive presence, even under pressure."

Executive presence is about how you show up, not just what you say. It's the combination of confidence, composure, and credibility that makes people want to follow you. Hewlett's research identifies three pillars: Gravitas (how you act), Communication (how you speak), and Appearance (how you look). We'll focus primarily on Gravitas and Communication.

The connection: All of today's frameworks (ethos-pathos-logos, Cialdini, SUCCESs) apply to high-stakes communication. But high-stakes contexts add pressure - Q&A sessions where you don't know the questions, difficult conversations where emotions run high, crisis situations where there's no time to prepare. Week 8 teaches you to maintain persuasive effectiveness when you can't script every word.

Pre-reading note: Both articles are paywalled, but short excerpts are available through the library. The Hewlett book is widely available - it's a bestseller. The Argenti article on 9/11 crisis communication is a classic case study of how organizations communicate under the worst possible circumstances.

Encourage students to think about their own experiences: "Have you ever had to give bad news to someone? Defend a decision you made? Answer a question you didn't know the answer to? These are all high-stakes communication moments. Next week we'll learn frameworks for handling them professionally."

Reassurance for quiet students: "Executive presence doesn't mean becoming someone you're not. Introverts can have powerful executive presence - it's about authenticity and preparation, not extroversion."

If students want deeper reading: Cialdini's "Influence" is the definitive persuasion text - 7 million copies sold, assigned at Stanford for 25+ years. Heath & Heath's "Made to Stick" is more accessible and full of fascinating examples.
