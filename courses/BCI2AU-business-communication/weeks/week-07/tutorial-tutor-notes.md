# Week 7 Tutorial: Tutor Notes

**Topic:** Persuasive Storytelling for Presentations
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Context:** Week 7 is Persuasive Proposal submission week AND mid-point preparation for Group Presentation (Week 12)

---

## Session Timing

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Quick Review | 5 min | Lecture recap + success criteria; emphasize Group Presentation connection |
| Story Development | 35 min | Individual outlining and practice; circulate to check progress |
| Peer Rehearsal (Triads) | 40 min | Each student performs 3-min story + receives 5-min feedback; monitor timing |
| Revision & Re-practice | 10 min | Individual refinement based on peer feedback |
| Class Showcase (Optional) | 8 min | 3-4 volunteers share stories (2 min each: story + debrief) |
| Before Next Class | 2 min | Quiz, pre-reading, Proposal reminder |

**Total:** 90 minutes (Class Showcase optional if time allows)

**Flexibility notes:**
- If students struggle with story development, extend Phase 1 to 40 min, compress peer rehearsal to 35 min
- Triads may finish rehearsal early - redirect to Phase 3 (revision) immediately
- Class Showcase is valuable but can be cut if time runs short - peer rehearsal is the essential learning activity
- If class has strong energy and students want to share, extend Showcase to 12 min, reduce revision to 6 min

**Critical timing enforcement:**
- Stories MUST be 3 minutes - use timer during peer rehearsal
- In triads: Each cycle is 8 min (3 min story + 5 min feedback). Full round = 24 min. Monitor to ensure all 3 students get equal time.

## Valid Student Approaches

Students will choose different story types and applications. Do NOT enforce one "correct" approach. Here are 4-5 valid paths:

### Approach 1: Professional Challenge Story with Social Proof + Authority

**Student tells:** Story of leading group project that was failing, turned it around by implementing agile methodology recommended by professor (Authority) that other successful teams were using (Social Proof)

**Story arc:**
- Hook: "Three weeks before deadline, my team hadn't started our capstone project"
- Conflict: Dysfunction, missed meetings, no progress
- Resolution: Applied structured methodology, delivered successful project

**Cialdini principles:**
- Authority: "Professor Nguyen recommended agile sprints—she'd advised 10+ successful capstone teams"
- Social Proof: "I showed the team how three other groups finished early using this approach"

**Why it works:** Clear challenge plot, concrete details, persuasive takeaway about structured methodology

**Tutor affirmation:** "Great use of Challenge plot. Your Authority application was clear when you cited the professor. The Social Proof about other teams made your solution credible."

---

### Approach 2: Customer Impact Story with Reciprocity + Scarcity

**Student tells:** Story about customer service rep who solved urgent problem for client, building long-term loyalty

**Story arc:**
- Hook: "A customer called at 4:45 PM on Friday, panicking about a critical order"
- Conflict: Order was delayed, customer needed it for Monday morning presentation, standard process couldn't help
- Resolution: Rep stayed late, coordinated with logistics, delivered Saturday morning

**Cialdini principles:**
- Reciprocity: "Customer was so grateful for the extra effort, they signed a long-term contract worth $50K"
- Scarcity: "We had one last chance to deliver before their Monday deadline"

**Why it works:** Connection plot (bridging gap between company and customer), emotional + concrete, clear business outcome

**Tutor affirmation:** "Your Connection plot worked well - we felt the relationship shift. Reciprocity was subtle but clear: exceptional service → customer loyalty."

---

### Approach 3: Change Advocacy Story with Commitment + Liking

**Student tells:** Story about advocating for mental health support program at university, using small commitments to build momentum

**Story arc:**
- Hook: "My roommate dropped out second year because she couldn't access counseling"
- Conflict: University had limited mental health resources, students were struggling, administration unaware of severity
- Resolution: Started small (peer support group), built to formal program proposal, administration approved pilot

**Cialdini principles:**
- Commitment: "Started by asking 10 students to sign petition → 50 attended town hall → 200 signed formal proposal"
- Liking: "Shared my own struggle with academic pressure - vulnerability built trust with student body"

**Why it works:** Challenge plot with social impact, shows escalation of commitment, emotionally resonant, concrete outcome

**Tutor affirmation:** "Powerful Challenge plot. Your Commitment principle was textbook - small petition to large movement. Sharing your personal struggle created Liking through common ground."

---

### Approach 4: Innovation Story with Authority + Unity

**Student tells:** Story about introducing new communication tool at internship, using expert backing and team identity

**Story arc:**
- Hook: "Our team was drowning in 300+ daily Slack messages—important updates were invisible"
- Conflict: Communication chaos, missed deadlines, team frustration
- Resolution: Researched solutions, piloted project management tool, team adopted it enthusiastically

**Cialdini principles:**
- Authority: "Cited Harvard Business Review article on communication overload—exactly our problem"
- Unity: "Positioned it as 'our solution to our problem' not 'my idea' - we built it together"

**Why it works:** Creativity plot (new approach succeeding), relatable problem, team-focused resolution

**Tutor affirmation:** "Strong Creativity plot. Authority was well-applied through HBR citation. Unity language ('our solution') showed you understand team dynamics."

---

### Approach 5: Personal Transformation Story with Liking + Scarcity

**Student tells:** Story about overcoming fear of public speaking to deliver important presentation

**Story arc:**
- Hook: "I once ran out of a classroom mid-presentation, terrified"
- Conflict: Severe presentation anxiety, avoided speaking situations, limiting career options
- Resolution: Joined Toastmasters, practiced systematically, delivered TEDx talk

**Cialdini principles:**
- Liking: "Many of you probably feel nervous presenting - I definitely did. Let me show you what worked."
- Scarcity: "TEDx only accepts 12 speakers annually - I had one shot to audition"

**Why it works:** Challenge plot, highly relatable, concrete transformation journey, vulnerability creates connection

**Tutor affirmation:** "Challenge plot with personal stakes. Your Liking application through shared vulnerability was effective - you made the audience root for you. Scarcity about TEDx added genuine pressure."

## Common Misconceptions to Address

### Misconception 1: "I don't have any good stories to tell"

**Student says:** "Nothing interesting has ever happened to me. I can't think of a story."

**Response:**
- Stories don't need to be dramatic—they need to be specific
- Professional challenge: Group project difficulty? Internship learning curve? Academic setback you overcame?
- Customer impact: Observation from part-time job? Family member's experience with company?
- Change advocacy: Something you wish was different on campus? In your community?
- Questions to unlock stories: "When did you solve a difficult problem? When did you help someone? When did you learn something important the hard way?"
- Reminder: The story exists to convey a persuasive message, not to impress with drama

**Example:** "Even 'I helped a confused customer find the right product' becomes persuasive when you add details and show the impact"

---

### Misconception 2: "I need to explicitly say 'This is Social Proof' or 'This is Scarcity'"

**Student says:** "Should I announce which principles I'm using in the story?"

**Response:**
- NO - weave principles into the narrative naturally
- Listeners should be able to identify them, but you shouldn't announce them
- After your story in debrief, THEN you state which principles you used
- Think of it like cooking: You use salt, but you don't say "Now I'm adding salt" while serving dinner
- Good integration: "Three other teams had tried this approach successfully" (Social Proof, but not labeled)
- Bad integration: "I'm now going to use the Social Proof principle by saying three teams succeeded"

**Example demonstration:** Tell 30-second story naturally, then show how you'd awkwardly label principles mid-story vs. smooth integration

---

### Misconception 3: "3 minutes isn't enough time for a story"

**Student says:** "I have so much to explain—3 minutes is too short!"

**Response:**
- 3 minutes is approximately 450-500 words spoken—that's substantial
- Most TED talks spend only 2-3 minutes per story within longer talk
- The constraint forces you to focus on essential details only
- Structure naturally fits: 20 sec hook + 2 min conflict + 40 sec resolution = 3 min
- If your story needs 5+ minutes, you're including too much background or side details
- Test: "What's the single most important thing the audience needs to know? Build from there."

**Technique:** Help student trim by asking: "What happens if you cut that detail? Do we still understand the story?" Often yes.

---

### Misconception 4: "Stories are just entertainment—they're not professional"

**Student says:** "Won't storytelling make my presentation seem less serious or credible?"

**Response:**
- Actually, the opposite—stories make complex information memorable and persuasive
- Look at Group Presentation rubric: "Compelling evidence" and "exceptional depth" - stories achieve both
- Business presentations that are all data are forgotten; presentations with story + data are remembered
- Every company uses storytelling: Apple product launches, Nike campaigns, startup pitches
- Key: Stories must serve a persuasive purpose, not be random anecdotes
- Balance: Stories carry pathos (emotion), but pair with logos (data) and ethos (citations)

**Example:** "Steve Jobs didn't just show iPhone specs—he told story of frustrating smartphones before iPhone. Story + data = persuasive."

---

### Misconception 5: "Cialdini principles feel manipulative to use"

**Student says:** "I feel uncomfortable intentionally using persuasion techniques—isn't that manipulation?"

**Response:**
- Distinction from lecture: Persuasion helps people make good decisions; manipulation deceives them
- If your story is TRUE and your message is BENEFICIAL, using principles is ethical
- Cialdini principles are how humans naturally think—you're working with cognitive patterns, not against them
- Unethical: Fabricating Social Proof ("Everyone believes this" when false)
- Ethical: Highlighting real Social Proof ("Three departments successfully tried this" when true)
- Transparency test: "Would you be comfortable if your audience knew you used Social Proof? If yes, it's persuasion."

**Reminder:** You're required to use 2+ principles for the assessment—learn to apply them ethically

## Facilitation Guidance per Phase

### Phase 1: Quick Review (5 min)

**Goal:** Activate prior knowledge, connect to Group Presentation assessment, set success criteria

**Script:**
- "Welcome. Today we're practicing oral storytelling—this directly prepares you for your Group Presentation in Week 12."
- "Your Group Presentation rubric rewards 'compelling evidence' and 'exceptional depth.' Stories are how you achieve both."
- "Quick recap of key frameworks..." [review 4 concepts from tutorial-content.md]
- "Success criteria for today..." [review what good work looks like]
- "Also reminder: Your Persuasive Proposal is due this week. Today's storytelling practice applies to written proposals too."
- "Questions before we begin?"

**Common questions:**
- "Is this graded?" → Not directly, but participation in tutorial activities contributes to your 10% participation grade. More importantly, this practices skills assessed in Group Presentation (40% total).
- "Can we work in groups?" → Phase 1 is individual development. Phase 2 is collaborative rehearsal in triads.

---

### Phase 2: Story Development (35 min)

**Goal:** Each student outlines and practices a 3-minute persuasive story individually

**Setup:**
- "You have 35 minutes to develop your story. Work individually."
- Write on board:
  1. Choose story option (5 min)
  2. Outline arc: Hook → Conflict → Resolution (15 min)
  3. Identify 2 Cialdini principles (10 min)
  4. Practice aloud to yourself (5 min)

**Facilitation tips:**
- **Circulate actively** - visit each student at least once during 35 min
- **Check progress at 10-min mark:** "Do you have a story topic chosen? Tell me in one sentence what happens."
- **Check progress at 20-min mark:** "Show me your outline. Where's your hook? Where's your conflict?"
- **Check progress at 30-min mark:** "Practice your opening 30 seconds aloud for me right now."

**Questions to ask struggling students:**
- "What's a challenge you've faced recently—at work, school, or life?"
- "Who's one person you've helped or observed being helped?"
- "What's one thing you think should change in your environment?"
- "When did you learn an important lesson the hard way?"

**Watch for:**
- **Student writes full script:** Redirect - "Don't write sentences, write bullet points. You'll tell this, not read it."
- **Student's story is too long:** Redirect - "That sounds like 5 minutes. What's the core? What can you cut?"
- **Student chooses boring/generic story:** Redirect - "Make it personal. Use real names. What specific details can you add?"
- **Student can't identify Cialdini principles:** Help - "Did you mention what others did? That's Social Proof. Did you cite an expert? That's Authority."

**Quiet room is good:** Students should be thinking, writing, muttering to themselves as they practice

---

### Phase 3: Peer Rehearsal in Triads (40 min)

**Goal:** Each student performs their story and receives structured feedback from 2 peers

**Setup:**
- "Form groups of 3. If we have extra students, make one group of 4."
- "Each person will tell their 3-minute story. After each story, 5 minutes of structured feedback."
- Display feedback structure on board:
  - Listener 1: Identify story arc (hook, conflict, resolution)
  - Listener 2: Identify Cialdini principles you heard
  - Both: What was most persuasive? What would strengthen it?

**Timing management:**
- Each cycle: 3 min story + 5 min feedback = 8 minutes
- Three students = 24 minutes total
- Remaining 16 minutes accounts for transitions and setup

**Facilitation tips:**
- **Start timer visibly:** "You have 40 minutes. Begin."
- **Circulate to each triad** - listen to at least one full story per group
- **Monitor timing:** If a story goes over 3:30, gently signal to wrap up
- **Listen to feedback quality:** Is it specific or generic?

**Good feedback examples:**
- "Your hook was strong - the Friday 4:45 PM panic immediately grabbed attention"
- "I heard Social Proof when you mentioned three other teams, and Authority when you cited the professor"
- "The conflict section was detailed, but resolution felt rushed—give us more of the outcome"

**Weak feedback examples:**
- "That was good" (too vague)
- "I liked it" (not helpful)
- "No suggestions" (not believable - everything can improve)

**If you hear weak feedback, intervene:**
- "Can you be more specific about what made it good?"
- "Which part of the story arc was strongest—hook, conflict, or resolution?"
- "Did you hear any Cialdini principles? Which ones?"

**Vietnamese cultural considerations:**
- Students may be overly polite and avoid critical feedback
- Encourage specificity: "Your job is to help your partner improve. Specific suggestions are more helpful than general praise."
- Model: "A good frame is: 'Your X was strong AND your Y could be stronger if you...'"

**Common questions during rehearsal:**
- "What if our triad finishes early?" → "Great! Move to Phase 3—revise your stories and practice again."
- "Can we go in a different order?" → "Yes, just ensure everyone gets equal time and feedback."
- "What if someone's story is too short or too long?" → "Feedback should include timing. 'Your story was 4 minutes—what could you cut?'"

---

### Phase 4: Revision & Re-practice (10 min)

**Goal:** Students refine their stories based on peer feedback

**Setup:**
- "You have 10 minutes to revise individually based on feedback you received"
- "Focus on: Making Cialdini principles clearer, strengthening your hook, tightening timing"
- "Practice your revised version aloud at least twice"

**Facilitation tips:**
- This is quiet individual work again
- Circulate and ask: "What did you change based on feedback?"
- Students who got feedback "no changes needed" → "Every story can improve. What's one detail you could make more concrete?"

**Students may:**
- Rewrite opening to make hook more compelling
- Add specific number or name to make story more concrete
- Explicitly mention "research shows" or "other teams used" to clarify Cialdini principle
- Cut side details to hit 3-minute target

**If time remains after 10 min:** Students can practice with a partner one more time, or prepare for Class Showcase

---

### Phase 5: Class Showcase (8 min, optional if time allows)

**Goal:** Selected students perform stories for full class; everyone learns from diverse approaches

**Setup:**
- "We have time for 3-4 volunteers to share their stories with the full class"
- "This is low-stakes practice—your Group Presentation in Week 12 is the high-stakes version"
- "After each story, the storyteller will briefly tell us which principles they used, then answer one question"

**Selection:**
- Ask for volunteers first - usually 1-2 will raise hands
- If not enough volunteers: "Who has a Challenge plot story? Let's hear one." (select by story type)
- Or: "Table by the window, who's ready to share?"

**Timing per student:**
- 3 min story
- 30 sec debrief (which principles, which plot)
- 1 min for one audience question
- Total: ~4.5 min per student, can fit 3 students in 12 min if needed, or 4 students rushing

**Managing showcase:**
- Introduce each student: "Let's hear from [name]"
- After story: "Great! Which 2 Cialdini principles did you use and which plot?"
- Then: "One question from the class for [name]?"
- Move quickly—this is demonstration, not deep critique

**If no volunteers:**
- That's okay—peer rehearsal was the main learning activity
- Say: "The practice you got in triads is the most valuable. You'll have more opportunities to share in Week 12."
- Skip to Phase 6

**Affirmation examples:**
- "Notice how [name]'s hook immediately created curiosity—we wanted to know what happened next"
- "Did everyone hear the Social Proof when [name] mentioned other companies?"
- "Three different story plots—Challenge, Connection, Creativity—all worked because they had clear arcs"

---

### Phase 6: Before Next Class (2 min)

**Goal:** Ensure students know deadlines and prep work

**Script:**
- "Three things before next class:"
- "One: Week 7 Quiz on Moodle covering today's lecture—due Sunday 11:59 PM"
- "Two: Pre-reading for Week 8 on Executive Presence—Chapters 1-4 on Moodle"
- "Three: SUBMIT your Persuasive Proposal this week. The storytelling and Cialdini principles you practiced today should appear in your written proposal."
- "Questions about deadlines or next week?"

---

## Addressing Specific Student Challenges

### Challenge 1: "I'm too nervous to tell a story in front of others"

**Response:**
- "That's exactly why we're practicing now—low stakes, supportive environment"
- "Your triads are small (3 people), not the full class"
- "Nervousness is normal—in Week 8 we'll learn techniques for managing presentation anxiety"
- "Remember: Group Presentation is 25% of your grade. This is practice for that high-stakes moment."
- "What helps: Practice your opening 30 seconds many times. A strong start builds confidence."

---

### Challenge 2: "My story is boring—it's just about a work situation"

**Response:**
- "Work situations make great stories when you add concrete details"
- "Boring: 'I solved a customer problem'"
- "Interesting: 'A customer called at 4:45 PM Friday, panicking. She needed her order by Monday morning for a critical presentation. Standard shipping couldn't help. Here's what I did...'"
- "Specifics make any story interesting: times, names, numbers, sensory details"
- "What exact time of day? Who was involved? What were the stakes? Add those."

---

### Challenge 3: "I can't tell if I'm using Cialdini principles correctly"

**Response:**
- "Let's check your outline. Read me your story key points."
- [After listening] "Okay, let's identify:"
- "Did you mention what others do/did? → Social Proof"
- "Did you cite research, expert, or your credentials? → Authority"
- "Did you mention a deadline or limited opportunity? → Scarcity"
- "Did you give information/help before asking? → Reciprocity"
- "Did you build from small to large request? → Commitment"
- "Did you emphasize commonality or shared identity? → Unity"
- "Did you establish rapport or similarity? → Liking"
- "Circle two strongest ones and make them more explicit in your telling"

---

### Challenge 4: "My story keeps going over 3 minutes"

**Response:**
- "Let's trim. Tell me the story right now—I'll time you."
- [After listening] "You went to 4:30. Here's what to cut:"
- "Background setup: Cut from 1 minute to 30 seconds. Start closer to the conflict."
- "Side details: Your description of the office layout doesn't matter. Cut it."
- "Dialogue: Don't quote full conversations. Summarize: 'She explained the urgency' not 'She said "I really need this because..."'"
- "Resolution: You have 40 seconds. State the outcome clearly and stop."
- "Try again—I'll give you hand signals at 2:30 (wrap up soon) and 3:00 (stop)"

---

### Challenge 5: "What if my triad partners aren't taking it seriously?"

**Response:**
- "Let me observe your triad." [Go listen]
- If true: Split up the triad, redistribute students to groups that are focused
- Often: Student perceives "not serious" when partners are just shy or quiet
- Redirect: "Model serious engagement. When you give detailed, specific feedback, you set the standard."
- "Remember: This is practice for assessment worth 25%. Treat it professionally."

---

## Cultural Considerations (Vietnamese Context)

### Face-Saving and Public Performance

**Context:** Vietnamese students may feel acute embarrassment performing in front of peers

**Tutor strategies:**
- Emphasize: "Everyone is nervous. Your triad partners feel the same way."
- Create safety: "Triads are private spaces. What's shared in your triad stays there."
- Normalize vulnerability: "Great stories often include personal struggles. Vulnerability creates connection."
- Frame as skill-building: "You're not being judged—you're practicing a professional skill."

---

### Hierarchy and Authority in Stories

**Context:** Students may feel uncomfortable challenging authority figures in stories or positioning themselves as experts

**Tutor strategies:**
- "Using Authority principle doesn't mean claiming you're the ultimate expert"
- "You can cite others' authority: 'Research from Stanford shows...' or 'My professor recommended...'"
- "Telling a story where you overcame a challenge isn't arrogance—it's demonstrating learning"
- "Frame it as: 'Here's what I learned from this experience' not 'Here's how smart I am'"

---

### Directness in Storytelling

**Context:** Vietnamese communication values indirectness; storytelling requires direct, clear narrative

**Tutor strategies:**
- "In storytelling, clarity is respect—you help your audience understand quickly"
- "Hook needs to be direct: 'My team was failing' not 'There were some challenges'"
- "Resolution needs to be clear: 'We delivered the project successfully and learned X' not 'Things improved somehow'"
- "This is a business communication skill—international audiences expect directness"

---

### Group Harmony vs. Individual Stories

**Context:** Students may feel uncomfortable highlighting individual achievement

**Tutor strategies:**
- "Even if you tell an individual story, you can emphasize collaboration: 'My team and I...' or 'With my mentor's support...'"
- "Challenge plot doesn't have to be solo hero journey—can be team overcoming obstacle together"
- "Connection plot naturally emphasizes relationships, not individual success"
- "If your story is genuinely individual, that's okay—learning to confidently share your contributions is a professional skill"

---

## Materials Checklist

**Required:**
- Timer with visible display (phone, classroom timer, or projector countdown)
- Whiteboard or projector to display:
  - Story development steps (Phase 1)
  - Feedback structure (Phase 2)
  - 3-minute countdown during peer rehearsal
- Student access to:
  - Lecture slides (digital or printed) - particularly Cialdini principles and story plots
  - Assessment Handbook Section 4 - Group Presentation rubric

**Optional but helpful:**
- Example story outline handout (hook/conflict/resolution template)
- Cialdini principles quick reference card (7 principles with one-sentence definitions)
- Story plot types visual (Challenge/Connection/Creativity with examples)

---

## Contingency Plans

### If students struggle to develop stories (Phase 1 running long):

**Solution:**
- Extend Phase 1 to 40 minutes
- Compress Phase 2 (Peer Rehearsal) to 35 minutes—still enough for 3 students × 8 min cycles
- Provide more scaffolding: "Everyone, tell me right now: What's your story about in one sentence?"
- Offer story starters on board:
  - "A time I helped someone with a problem..."
  - "When I faced a challenge at work/school and overcame it..."
  - "A situation that made me want to change something..."

---

### If class has odd number for triads:

**Solution:**
- Make one group of 4 instead of all triads
- Group of 4: Each person still gets 3 min story + 5 min feedback, just 4 cycles instead of 3
- Give that group extra 8 minutes (total 48 min instead of 40)
- Or: Tutor joins a pair to make it a triad

---

### If a triad finishes rehearsal significantly early (30 min instead of 40):

**Solution:**
- "Excellent! Now do a second round—each person perform your revised story again with improvements."
- Or: "Practice handling Q&A. After each story, triad asks 2 questions about the content."
- Or: "Help each other strengthen weak spots. Work together to make one person's hook more compelling."

---

### If no one volunteers for Class Showcase:

**Solution:**
- "That's fine—the peer practice was the main learning activity"
- "Who's willing to just share which story plot you used and one challenge you faced?" (lower stakes)
- Or skip Class Showcase entirely and extend Phase 4 (Revision) by 5 minutes
- Or: "Let's do pair shares—turn to person next to you and tell your story one more time. 6 minutes total."

---

### If stories consistently run over 3 minutes during peer rehearsal:

**Solution:**
- Interrupt gently: "Let's pause. Everyone's stories are going long. Here's how to trim..."
- Teach: "Start your story at the moment of conflict, not 2 minutes before. Cut backstory."
- Reset: "Retry your story. If you hit 3:00, your partners will tap the desk as a signal to wrap up in next 15 seconds."

---

### If student becomes emotional while telling personal story:

**Solution:**
- This is normal—stories can be vulnerable
- Allow brief pause: "Take your time. Deep breath."
- Affirm: "Sharing a meaningful experience takes courage. You're doing great."
- If student needs to stop: "Would you like to take a break and try again in a few minutes? Or choose a different story?"
- Remind triad: "What we share in this space stays here. Thank you for creating a supportive environment."

---

## Success Indicators (How to Know Tutorial Worked)

**During tutorial:**
- Students develop story outlines with clear hook/conflict/resolution structure (check during Phase 1 circulation)
- Triads are actively engaged—you hear stories being told, not side conversations
- Feedback conversations are specific—students identify which principles they heard
- Students revise their stories during Phase 4 (not sitting idle)

**After tutorial:**
- Students report feeling more confident about oral storytelling for Group Presentation
- Submitted Persuasive Proposals this week include concrete stories with Cialdini principles
- In Week 12 Group Presentations, you observe storytelling techniques practiced today

**Red flags during tutorial:**
- Students write full scripts instead of outlines (redirect to bullet points)
- Peer feedback is all generic praise "good job" (intervene to model specific feedback)
- Students appear confused about which Cialdini principle they're using (help identify explicitly)
- Triads finish in 20 minutes instead of 40 (they're not giving thorough feedback—check quality)

**If you see red flags, address immediately—don't wait until end of tutorial.**

---

## Connection to Week 12 Group Presentation

**Emphasize throughout tutorial:**

- "Today's 3-minute story is practice for your 15-minute Group Presentation"
- "In Week 12, your team will tell a larger story arc across your presentation—today you're learning the micro-structure"
- "Group Presentation rubric rewards 'compelling evidence' (stories provide this) and 'exceptional depth' (stories demonstrate insights)"
- "Every great presentation includes 2-3 stories woven through the content—you're building that skill now"

**For students asking "Why are we doing this when Proposal is due?":**
- "The Persuasive Proposal is written communication. Today practices oral communication—a different skill."
- "However, the storytelling and Cialdini principles you practice today ALSO strengthen your written proposal."
- "You're building two professional skills simultaneously: persuasive writing and persuasive speaking."
