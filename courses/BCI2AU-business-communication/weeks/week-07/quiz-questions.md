    topic: "Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals"

    question: |
      Which of Aristotle's three rhetorical appeals focuses on establishing speaker credibility and trustworthiness?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Ethos - credibility and character"
        feedback: "Correct! Ethos is the appeal to credibility, character, and trustworthiness."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Pathos - emotional appeals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Pathos appeals to emotion and values, not credibility."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Logos - logical reasoning"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Logos appeals to logic and evidence, not speaker credibility."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Kairos - timing and context"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Kairos refers to timing and context, not one of Aristotle's three main appeals."

    general_feedback: |
      Aristotle identified three appeals in persuasive communication: <b>Ethos</b> (establishing credibility and trustworthiness of the speaker), <b>Pathos</b> (appealing to audience emotions), and <b>Logos</b> (using logical reasoning and evidence). All three appeals work together in effective persuasion. See Week 7 slides 7-9.

    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals"

    question: |
      How do ethos and logos differ as persuasive appeals?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Ethos builds credibility and trust; Logos provides logical evidence and reasoning"
        feedback: "Correct! Ethos answers 'Why trust you?' while Logos answers 'Is this argument logical?'"
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Ethos appeals to emotion; Logos appeals to credibility"
        feedback: "Incorrect. You have these reversed. Ethos = credibility, Pathos = emotion, Logos = logic."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Both focus on emotional connection; they differ only in intensity"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Ethos focuses on credibility and Logos on logic - neither is primarily about emotion (that's Pathos)."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Ethos uses statistics; Logos uses personal stories"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is backwards. Logos uses statistics and evidence; Ethos establishes credibility through credentials and character."

    general_feedback: |
      Ethos establishes why the audience should trust you (credentials, character, sources). Logos provides logical reasoning with evidence (data, research, <b>structured</b> (organized, methodical) arguments). Both are essential but serve different purposes in persuasion. See Week 7 slides 7-9.

  - id: "W7-Q3-balanced-appeals"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals"

    question: |
      What is the main problem with presentations that rely too heavily on logos (data and logic) while neglecting pathos (emotion)?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "They convince intellectually but don't inspire action"
        feedback: "Correct! Logic alone may win minds but emotion is needed to move people to act."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "They are too short and lack sufficient detail"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The length isn't the issue - the problem is lack of emotional connection despite having detailed data."

      - key: "C"
        text: "They establish too much credibility with the audience"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Over-reliance on logos doesn't address credibility (that's ethos) - the issue is lack of emotional connection."

      - key: "D"
        text: "They use too many personal stories instead of evidence"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes too much pathos, not too much logos. Logos-heavy presentations have excessive data, not stories."

    general_feedback: |
      Duarte's research shows that presentations need balance: too much logos (data) without pathos (emotion) leads to audiences who intellectually agree but don't take action. While logical arguments convince the mind, emotional resonance <b>spurs</b> (triggers, motivates) people into action. See Week 7 slide 8.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion"

    question: |
      How many principles of persuasion did Cialdini identify in his research?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Seven principles"
        feedback: "Correct! Cialdini's framework includes seven principles: Reciprocity, Commitment/Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity, and Unity."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Three principles"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Three is the number of Aristotle's rhetorical appeals, not Cialdini's principles."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Six principles"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The original version had six, but Cialdini added Unity in 2021, bringing the total to seven."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Five principles"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Cialdini identified seven principles of persuasion."

    general_feedback: |
      Cialdini's <b>Influence</b> (book title) framework identifies seven psychological principles that activate automatic compliance responses: Reciprocity, Commitment/Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity, and Unity (added in 2021). These principles are hardwired mental shortcuts that bypass <b>analytical</b> (logical, reasoning-based) thinking. See Week 7 slide 11.

  - id: "W7-Q5-reciprocity-definition"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion"

    question: |
      What distinguishes the reciprocity principle from other persuasion techniques?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "People feel obligated to return favors, even small unsolicited ones"
        feedback: "Correct! Reciprocity creates a sense of obligation when someone provides value first, triggering the desire to give back."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "People value items that are rare or in limited supply"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the Scarcity principle, not Reciprocity."

      - key: "C"
        text: "People follow what similar others are doing"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes Social Proof, not Reciprocity."

      - key: "D"
        text: "People defer to credible experts and authority figures"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the Authority principle, not Reciprocity."

    general_feedback: |
      The Reciprocity principle works because humans feel obligated to return favors. Research shows that even small, unsolicited gifts create a sense of <b>obligation</b> (duty, responsibility to repay). The restaurant mint study found tips increased 23% when servers gave personalized extra mints. The key is that the favor comes FIRST and feels genuine, not transactional. See Week 7 slide 12.

  - id: "W7-Q6-social-proof-mechanism"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion"

    question: |
      Why is social proof especially powerful when people are uncertain about what to do?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "People assume others have information they don't and follow their lead"
        feedback: "Correct! Under uncertainty, we use others' behavior as a shortcut for decision-making."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Uncertainty makes people more sensitive to price discounts"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This isn't about social proof - it relates more to scarcity or value perception."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Uncertain people are more likely to trust authority figures"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While uncertainty does increase reliance on authorities, this describes the Authority principle, not Social Proof."

      - key: "D"
        text: "People under uncertainty prefer to make independent decisions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is the opposite of what happens - uncertainty increases reliance on social proof, not independence."

    general_feedback: |
      Social Proof is powerful under uncertainty because people assume others possess knowledge they lack. The hotel towel study showed that "75% of guests in this room reused towels" increased compliance by 33% over generic environmental appeals. When we don't know what to do, following what similar others do is an efficient <b>heuristic</b> (mental shortcut) for decision-making. See Week 7 slide 13.

  - id: "W7-Q7-scarcity-psychology"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion"

    question: |
      What psychological concept underlies the Scarcity principle?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Loss aversion - fear of losing feels stronger than desire for gaining"
        feedback: "Correct! Kahneman's research shows losing $100 feels roughly twice as bad as gaining $100 feels good."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Cognitive dissonance - inconsistency between beliefs and actions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Cognitive dissonance relates to the Commitment/Consistency principle, not Scarcity."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Social comparison - evaluating ourselves against others"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Social comparison relates to Social Proof, not Scarcity."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Confirmation bias - seeking information that confirms existing beliefs"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Confirmation bias isn't the foundation of Scarcity; loss aversion is."

    general_feedback: |
      The Scarcity principle is based on <b>loss aversion</b> (stronger negative reaction to losses than positive reaction to gains), documented by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. Psychologically, losing $100 feels roughly twice as bad as gaining $100 feels good. This <b>asymmetry</b> (imbalance, unequal weighting) makes "last chance" framing incredibly powerful, explaining why British Airways Concorde sales surged after discontinuation was announced. See Week 7 slide 14.

  - id: "W7-Q8-authority-ethos"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion"

    question: |
      How does Cialdini's Authority principle relate to Aristotle's rhetorical appeals?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Authority is the modern psychological validation of Ethos (credibility)"
        feedback: "Correct! Both Authority and Ethos establish trustworthiness through credible sources and expertise."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Authority contradicts Ethos by focusing on emotion instead of credibility"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Authority and Ethos both focus on credibility, not emotion (that would be Pathos)."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Authority replaces Logos as the primary logical appeal"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Authority relates to credibility (Ethos), not logical reasoning (Logos)."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Authority and Ethos are opposing concepts that cannot be used together"
        feedback: "Incorrect. They're complementary - Authority is essentially the psychological research validating Aristotle's Ethos concept."

    general_feedback: |
      Cialdini's Authority principle is essentially modern psychological validation of Aristotle's Ethos appeal. Both establish credibility through expert sources, credentials, and trustworthiness. Research shows citing authoritative sources increases persuasiveness by 40%. Petty & Cacioppo's <b>Elaboration Likelihood Model</b> (theory about how people process persuasive messages) found people assume cited claims are more truthful. See Week 7 slide 15.

    topic: "SUCCESs Framework"

    question: |
      What do the letters in the SUCCESs framework stand for?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories"
        feedback: "Correct! These six principles make ideas sticky - memorable and actionable."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Strategy, Unity, Commitment, Credibility, Empathy, Structure"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This isn't the SUCCESs framework. Review the Heath brothers' six principles."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Simple, Universal, Clear, Credible, Engaging, Strong"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While some words are close, this isn't the correct SUCCESs framework."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Strategic, Unexpected, Clear, Compelling, Emotional, Short"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This isn't the SUCCESs framework. The correct version includes Concrete, not Clear."

    general_feedback: |
      The SUCCESs framework by Chip and Dan Heath identifies six principles for making ideas <b>sticky</b> (memorable, easy to recall): Simple (strip to core), Unexpected (violate expectations), Concrete (vivid details), Credible (build trust), Emotional (connect to identity), and Stories (narratives drive action). Each principle addresses a barrier to communication - attention, memory, or action. See Week 7 slide 17.

  - id: "W7-Q10-simple-vs-complex"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SUCCESs Framework"

    question: |
      What is the main purpose of the Simple principle in the SUCCESs framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Strip message to single most important element so people remember the core"
        feedback: "Correct! The Simple principle fights information overload by finding the Commander's Intent - the ONE thing that matters."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Reduce vocabulary to elementary school level for all audiences"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Simple doesn't mean simplistic - it's about prioritizing the core message, not dumbing down language."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Create curiosity gaps that violate audience expectations"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the Unexpected principle, not Simple."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Use concrete details instead of abstract concepts"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes the Concrete principle, not Simple."

    general_feedback: |
      The Simple principle strips messages to their core - the "Commander's Intent." Military doctrine teaches that when plans fail, soldiers need to know the ONE essential objective. Southwest Airlines demonstrates this: "We are THE low-fare airline" - a simple principle that guides all decisions. As the Heath brothers say: "Simplicity isn't about dumbing down, it's about prioritizing." See Week 7 slide 18.

  - id: "W7-Q11-concrete-abstract"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "SUCCESs Framework"

    question: |
      Why does concrete language create more persuasive messages than abstract language?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Our brains remember sensory details better than abstract concepts"
        feedback: "Correct! Concrete language creates mental pictures; abstractions have nothing for the brain to visualize."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Concrete language uses simpler words that are easier to spell"
        feedback: "Incorrect. It's not about spelling difficulty - it's about creating vivid mental images vs. vague abstractions."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Abstract language is always more professional than concrete examples"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is the opposite of what research shows - concrete details increase both credibility and memory."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Concrete language requires fewer words than abstract descriptions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Word count isn't the issue - vividness and mental imagery are what make concrete language powerful."

    general_feedback: |
      Concrete language works because our brains evolved to process sensory information (sights, sounds, physical objects), not abstractions like "optimize operational efficiency." When you say "4 hours every Friday," people can visualize it. The CSPI movie popcorn campaign made abstract nutrition data concrete and memorable: "More fat than bacon-and-eggs breakfast, Big Mac lunch, AND steak dinner combined." See Week 7 slide 19.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Ethical Persuasion Framework"

    question: |
      What is the key difference between ethical persuasion and manipulation?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Ethical persuasion uses truthful claims toward mutual benefit; manipulation uses deception for one-sided gain"
        feedback: "Correct! Cialdini distinguishes influence (ethical persuasion) from manipulation through truth, transparency, and mutual benefit."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Ethical persuasion uses only logical appeals; manipulation uses emotional appeals"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both ethical persuasion and manipulation can use emotion - the difference is truthfulness and intent."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Ethical persuasion never uses psychological principles; manipulation always does"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Ethical persuasion can use psychological principles - the difference is whether claims are truthful and mutually beneficial."

      - key: "D"
        text: "There is no difference - all persuasion is manipulation"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Cialdini clearly distinguishes ethical influence (truthful, mutually beneficial) from manipulation (deceptive, one-sided)."

    general_feedback: |
      The Ethical Persuasion Test asks three questions: (1) Truth - Are claims factually accurate? (2) Transparency - Would this work if the audience knew your techniques? (3) Benefit - Are they better off if they say yes? Ethical persuasion passes all three tests; manipulation fails at least one. Cialdini calls this the "grandmother test": Would you persuade your grandmother to do this? See Week 7 slide 23.
