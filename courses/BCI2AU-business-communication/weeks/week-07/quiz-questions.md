1. Reciprocity
2. Social Proof
3. Scarcity
4. Authority

A) People defer to credible experts and legitimate authorities
B) People value what's rare or diminishing; fear of missing out drives action

D) People feel obligated to return favors and concessions

**Answer:**
1-D, 2-C, 3-B, 4-A

**Feedback:**

- **Social Proof (2-C):** People follow what others do, especially similar others—the hotel towel study showed 33% increase when messaging referenced "guests in this room."
- **Scarcity (3-B):** People value rare things—"only 3 left" or "sale ends Friday" creates urgency through fear of missing out.
- **Authority (4-A):** People trust experts—"9 out of 10 dentists recommend" leverages expert credibility.

### Q5: Change Storytelling Framework Steps
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Frei & Morriss's change storytelling framework, what is the correct sequence of steps?

A) Articulate mandate → Honor past → Understand simply → Path forward
B) Understand simply → Articulate mandate → Honor past → Path forward
C) Understand simply → Honor past → Articulate mandate → Path forward
D) Honor past → Understand simply → Articulate mandate → Path forward

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This sequence starts with the mandate before establishing context, which creates resistance. The correct order builds foundation first.
- **B) Incorrect.** Articulating the mandate (why change now) should come after honoring the past, not before—otherwise it dismisses what came before.
- **C) Correct!** The sequence is: 1) Understand deeply, describe simply, 2) Honor the past, 3) Articulate a persuasive mandate, 4) Lay out a rigorous and optimistic path forward.
- **D) Incorrect.** Honoring the past comes second, not first—you need to establish what the change is (step 1) before acknowledging history.

### Q6: Purpose of "Concrete" in SUCCESs
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

Why is "concrete" important for making ideas stick, according to Heath & Heath?

A) It makes complex ideas sound more professional and sophisticated
B) It provides vivid, tangible details that are easier to understand and remember than abstractions
C) It allows you to include more technical data and statistics
D) It helps you avoid revealing too much specific information

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Concrete details actually make ideas MORE accessible, not more sophisticated—abstraction often sounds professional but is harder to remember.
- **B) Correct!** Heath & Heath state "Abstraction makes it harder to understand and remember." Concrete details like "2 hours daily" (not "significant time") create vivid mental images that stick.
- **C) Incorrect.** Being concrete means using specific examples and sensory details, not adding more statistics—"white Ford truck" beats "vehicle."
- **D) Incorrect.** Concrete actually means being MORE specific, not less—it's about vivid details that make ideas real and memorable.

### Q7: Reciprocity Mechanism
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

The reciprocity principle works best when the gift or favor comes after you make your request, as a reward for compliance.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
- **False - Correct!** Reciprocity requires that the gift or favor comes FIRST, before any request, with no apparent strings attached. This creates psychological obligation to reciprocate later. The restaurant mint study showed tips increased when mints were given before payment, not after. If the gift comes after compliance, it's a reward, not reciprocity.
- **True - Incorrect.** This would reverse the reciprocity mechanism. The principle works because receiving something first creates a sense of obligation—the gift must precede the request for reciprocity to activate.

### Q8: Balancing Aristotle's Appeals
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

A presentation that is entirely focused on logos (data, statistics, research) is ideal for business audiences because they value logic and evidence.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
- **False - Correct!** While business audiences value logos, Duarte's research shows that presentations need to balance all three appeals. A presentation that is "too analytical" (all logos) feels like a spreadsheet, doesn't inspire action, and is easily forgotten. You need ethos (credibility), pathos (emotional connection), and logos (evidence) working together.
- **True - Incorrect.** This represents a common mistake in business communication. Pure logos presentations are boring and don't drive action—"Duarte warns about being too emotional OR too analytical." Balance is essential.

### Q9: Call to Action Design
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

Why should a strong call to action offer a single specific action rather than multiple options?

A) It shows you are confident and authoritative
B) It saves time by shortening the presentation
C) Decision fatigue from too many options reduces the likelihood of any action
D) It's easier to measure one action than several

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While confidence matters, the main reason is psychological—multiple options create decision paralysis, not a lack of authority.
- **B) Incorrect.** The length of the presentation isn't the issue; it's about whether the audience actually takes action afterward.
- **C) Correct!** Offering multiple options creates decision fatigue, which kills action. Columbia research shows specific CTAs are 3x more likely to generate action than vague or multi-option requests.
- **D) Incorrect.** While measurement is easier with one action, the primary reason is psychological effectiveness—reducing friction and decision fatigue increases compliance.

### Q10: Ethical Persuasion Standard
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to the lecture, what is the key distinction between ethical persuasion and manipulation?

A) Persuasion uses research citations; manipulation does not
B) Persuasion respects autonomy and helps good decisions; manipulation deceives or coerces for selfish gain
C) Persuasion is used in business; manipulation is used in sales
D) Persuasion uses logos; manipulation uses pathos

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Both persuasion and manipulation can use research—ethical distinction isn't about which techniques you use, but whether you're honest and serving mutual benefit.
- **B) Correct!** The lecture states: "Persuasion helps people make good decisions faster. Manipulation exploits shortcuts for selfish gain." The transparency test is: Would you be comfortable if the audience knew your techniques?
- **C) Incorrect.** Both business and sales can use ethical persuasion or unethical manipulation—the context doesn't determine ethics, the intent and honesty do.
- **D) Incorrect.** Both persuasion and manipulation can use logos, pathos, or ethos—ethical distinction is about truthfulness and mutual benefit, not which appeals you employ.
