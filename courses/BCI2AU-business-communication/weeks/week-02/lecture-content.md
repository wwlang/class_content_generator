# Only 12%

**of CEOs feel successful at external stakeholder management**

**despite 58% viewing it as a top priority**

*(McKinsey & Company, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
This striking statistic reveals a massive gap between intention and execution. Even at the CEO level, stakeholder communication is recognized as critical but rarely done well. This week equips you with frameworks that close this gap.

Students often ask: "Why the disconnect?" The answer: most leaders lack systematic frameworks for stakeholder analysis. They know it matters but don't have structured approaches - which is exactly what today's lecture provides.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** stakeholder groups using Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke Model
2. **Prioritize** stakeholders using Mitchell's Power-Legitimacy-Urgency framework
3. **Analyze** audience needs through stakeholder mapping matrices
4. **Adapt** message content and tone for different audience types using Duarte's calibration framework

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are testable and appear in Week 2's online quiz. More importantly, they directly prepare you for the Business Memo assignment due Week 4.

The progression is intentional: identify who matters (Freeman), determine priority order (Mitchell), understand what they need (mapping), and adapt your message accordingly (Duarte).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="4" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You

## Today's Journey

**Part 1:** Stakeholder Identification (Freeman's Model) – 20 minutes

**Part 2:** Stakeholder Prioritization (Mitchell's Salience Framework) – 25 minutes

**Part 3:** Message Adaptation (Mapping & Duarte's Calibration) – 25 minutes

<speaker-notes>
Three distinct segments, each building on the previous. We'll move from broad identification (who are all the stakeholders?) to strategic prioritization (who gets attention first?) to tactical execution (how do I adapt my message?).

Return to this slide at each transition to help students track progress.

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Part 1 Introduction">

## Part 1: Stakeholder Identification

**The Foundation Question:** Who actually matters in business communication?

<speaker-notes>
Transition from roadmap. The starting point for all strategic communication is answering this deceptively simple question: who are your stakeholders?

Many students initially think only of customers or shareholders. Freeman's model reveals the much broader ecosystem that affects and is affected by organizations.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" title="Freeman's Revolutionary Insight">

## The Traditional View Was Too Narrow

**Before Freeman (1984):**
- Organizations existed primarily to serve shareholders
- Other groups were secondary considerations
- Communication focused on investors and customers

**Freeman's Challenge:**
- Organizations exist within webs of relationships
- Success requires managing ALL stakeholder groups
- Strategic communication must address diverse audiences

<speaker-notes>
In the early 1980s, business thinking was dominated by shareholder primacy - the idea that companies existed primarily to maximize returns for investors. Freeman challenged this fundamentally.

His book "Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach" (1984) has over 100,000 citations and created an entire field of study. The Academy of Management recognized it as one of the most influential business books ever written.

Key insight: organizations cannot succeed by ignoring employees, communities, regulators, or other groups who can affect or are affected by decisions.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke Model">

## Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke Stakeholder Model

**Definition:** Organization at center, stakeholder groups radiating outward

**11 Original Categories (non-exhaustive):**

**Internal:**
- Employees
- Shareholders
- Management

**External:**
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Financiers
- Government/Regulators
- Political groups
- Trade associations
- Competitors
- Media
- Communities

<speaker-notes>
The hub-and-spoke visual places the organization at the center with stakeholder groups as spokes radiating outward. You could sketch this on a whiteboard - a circle in the middle labeled "Organization" with lines extending to stakeholder groups.

Freeman's list was deliberately non-exhaustive to encourage thinking: "Who else might affect or be affected by this decision?" The specific stakeholders vary by industry, organization size, and context.

Important distinction: Internal stakeholders (employees, shareholders, management) have direct organizational ties. External stakeholders (customers, regulators, communities) interact from outside but still have legitimate interests.

Common student question: "What about competitors?" Yes - competitors are stakeholders because their actions affect your strategy and vice versa.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="9" title="Freeman's Core Definition">

## The Foundational Definition

> "A stakeholder in an organization is **any group or individual who can affect or is affected by** the achievement of the organization's objectives."
>
> – R. Edward Freeman (1984)

**Two-way relationship:**
- Groups who can **affect** the organization (influence, power, resources)
- Groups who are **affected by** the organization (impacted by decisions)

<speaker-notes>
This is THE foundational definition in stakeholder theory. Note the bidirectional nature: "can affect OR is affected by."

The "or" is critical - you don't need both conditions. A local community may be affected by a factory's pollution even if they have limited power to affect the factory's operations. Conversely, a government regulator may affect the factory without being directly affected by its daily operations.

This definition expanded business thinking beyond just economic exchanges to include social and environmental impacts. It's the basis for modern corporate social responsibility frameworks.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Stakeholder Management Framework">

## Freeman's Three-Process Framework

**1. Environmental Scanning**
- Identify all stakeholder groups systematically
- Consider both obvious and non-obvious groups
- Map relationships and interdependencies

**2. Stakeholder Analysis**
- Understand each group's interests and influence
- Assess what each group needs or wants
- Identify potential conflicts between groups

**3. Strategic Planning**
- Incorporate stakeholder concerns into decisions
- Develop communication strategies for each group
- Balance competing interests ethically

<speaker-notes>
Freeman didn't just identify stakeholders - he provided a management framework. These three processes work cyclically, not linearly.

Environmental scanning is ongoing because stakeholder landscapes change. For example, social media gave customers and activists new channels to affect organizations, fundamentally altering the stakeholder environment.

Stakeholder analysis requires empathy and research. You can't assume what employees or communities want - you must investigate through surveys, focus groups, or dialogue.

Strategic planning becomes stakeholder-informed rather than stakeholder-blind. Decisions consider impacts across the full stakeholder web, not just shareholder returns.

A diagram showing these three processes in a cycle can help visualize the continuous nature of stakeholder management.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Freeman Example - Factory Expansion">

## Example: Manufacturing Company Expansion

**Scenario:** A Vietnamese manufacturing company plans to open a new factory

**Stakeholder Identification (Freeman's Model):**

| Internal | External |
|----------|----------|
| Current employees (job opportunities) | Local community (jobs, pollution concerns) |
| Shareholders (capital investment) | Environmental groups (impact assessment) |
| Management (execution responsibility) | Government (permits, regulations) |
| | Suppliers (new contracts) |
| | Customers (supply chain stability) |

**Key Insight:** Decision affects 9+ distinct stakeholder groups with different interests

<speaker-notes>
Let's make Freeman's model concrete. A factory expansion seems like a straightforward business decision, but applying the hub-and-spoke model reveals the complexity.

Notice the tensions: shareholders want profitability, communities want jobs but fear pollution, environmental groups demand sustainability, employees want career growth but worry about relocation.

This isn't just theoretical - Vietnamese companies expanding domestically or internationally face exactly these stakeholder dynamics. Vinamilk's factory expansions, for example, must navigate community relations, environmental regulations, employee concerns, and investor expectations simultaneously.

The framework doesn't provide answers but ensures you ask the right questions: Who have we not considered? Whose voices are missing? What groups could affect this decision's success?
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Why Freeman Matters for Communication">

## Communication Implications

**Each stakeholder group needs:**
- Different information emphasis
- Different communication channels
- Different timing and frequency
- Different tone and style

**Example: Factory Expansion Announcements**

| Stakeholder | Primary Message | Channel | Timing |
|-------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Employees | Career opportunities, job security | Town hall, email | First (before public) |
| Community | Jobs created, environmental safety | Public meeting, media | Second (after employees) |
| Investors | ROI, strategic rationale | Earnings call, report | Third (after internal) |
| Regulators | Compliance, impact mitigation | Formal submission | Throughout (legal requirement) |

<speaker-notes>
This slide connects Freeman's identification model to actual communication practice. Simply knowing who stakeholders are isn't enough - you must communicate strategically with each group.

The timing sequence is critical. Employees should hear first - discovering major changes through media damages trust. Communities deserve early engagement before permits are filed. Investors expect formal disclosures aligned with regulatory requirements.

Message emphasis varies: employees care about job security and advancement, communities about local impact and safety, investors about financial returns, regulators about legal compliance.

Vietnamese context: Communication with government stakeholders often requires formal, deferential tone and face-to-face meetings. Community communication may need Vietnamese language materials and local leader engagement.

This table format works well for planning actual communication rollouts. Students will use similar analysis in their Week 4 memo.

<slide number="13" layout="section-break" title="Part 2 Introduction">

## Part 2: Stakeholder Prioritization

**The Resource Question:** When you can't address everyone equally, who comes first?

<speaker-notes>
Transition to Part 2. Freeman tells us who stakeholders are, but organizations face a practical problem: limited resources. You can't communicate equally with all groups simultaneously.

This is where Mitchell's framework becomes essential. It operationalizes Freeman's theory into a prioritization system.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="The Prioritization Challenge">

## Why Prioritization Matters

**The Reality:**
- Limited communication resources (time, budget, personnel)
- Competing stakeholder demands
- Urgent situations requiring triage
- Different stakeholders need different attention levels

**The Question Mitchell Answered:**
- "Who and what really counts?"
- Which stakeholders deserve attention **first**?
- How do we systematically prioritize without bias?

<speaker-notes>
Mitchell et al.'s 1997 paper "Toward a Theory of Stakeholder Identification and Salience" has 12,197 citations and remains the dominant framework for stakeholder prioritization.

The title's emphasis on "who and what really counts" reflects the core managerial challenge. Freeman said everyone matters, but managers need to allocate finite resources. Mitchell provided the answer with empirical grounding.

Students sometimes worry prioritization means ignoring stakeholders. Clarify: prioritization determines attention ORDER and INTENSITY, not whether to address groups at all. Even low-priority stakeholders receive communication - just less frequent or detailed.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="Mitchell's Salience Model">

## Mitchell's Stakeholder Salience Framework

**Three Attributes Determine Priority:**

**1. Power**
- Extent a party can impose its will in a relationship
- Sources: authority, resources, access to information
- Example: Regulator can shut down operations

**2. Legitimacy**
- Socially accepted and expected structures or behaviors
- Based on norms, laws, or moral claims
- Example: Employees have legitimate claim to safe working conditions

**3. Urgency**
- Time sensitivity or criticality of stakeholder claims
- Degree to which delay is unacceptable
- Example: Product recall requires immediate customer communication

<speaker-notes>
Mitchell's model uses three attributes that combine to determine stakeholder salience - how much attention they command from managers.

Power is about capability to influence outcomes. A major customer has power through revenue contribution. A regulatory body has power through legal authority. An activist group may have power through media access and public opinion.

Legitimacy addresses whether the stakeholder's claim is socially recognized as valid. Not all powerful groups have legitimate claims, and not all legitimate claims come from powerful groups. A charity has legitimate social claims but may lack power to compel corporate action.

Urgency adds time dimension. A routine employee request has legitimacy but low urgency. A safety violation has both legitimacy and high urgency. Crisis situations inherently carry urgency.

The genius of Mitchell's model: these attributes are independent and can be combined in different ways to create stakeholder classifications.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Power Types">

## Sources of Stakeholder Power

**Coercive Power** – Ability to impose sanctions or harm
- Regulators enforcing fines
- Unions threatening strikes
- Activists organizing boycotts

**Utilitarian Power** – Control over resources organization needs
- Major customers providing revenue
- Suppliers controlling critical inputs
- Investors providing capital

**Normative Power** – Influence through symbolic or prestige means
- Media shaping public narrative
- Industry associations setting standards
- Academic institutions conferring legitimacy

<speaker-notes>
Mitchell draws on Etzioni's power typology to show power comes from multiple sources, not just formal authority.

Coercive power works through fear of consequences. Government regulators can fine companies, shut facilities, or prosecute violations. Labor unions can strike, disrupting operations. Activist groups can damage reputation through negative publicity.

Utilitarian power works through economic dependence. A customer representing 40% of revenue has enormous power - losing them threatens viability. Suppliers of unique components have power through scarcity. Investors have power through capital allocation.

Normative power works through legitimacy and symbolism. Media can't legally force action but shapes how others perceive the organization. Industry associations set standards that become expectations. Universities provide credibility through research partnerships or recruiting relationships.

Vietnamese context: Government stakeholders often combine all three power types - coercive (regulatory authority), utilitarian (permits and approvals required), and normative (conferring legitimacy through endorsement).

Understanding power sources helps predict stakeholder influence and communication needs.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="Legitimacy Types">

## Sources of Stakeholder Legitimacy

**Individual Legitimacy** – Personal stake or rights
- Property owners affected by development
- Consumers of recalled products
- Employees impacted by restructuring

**Organizational Legitimacy** – Formal relationship or contract
- Shareholders owning equity
- Suppliers under contract
- Customers with warranties

**Societal Legitimacy** – Socially recognized claims
- Environmental groups protecting public goods
- NGOs advocating for vulnerable populations
- Community groups preserving local interests

<speaker-notes>
Legitimacy answers: "Does this stakeholder have a valid claim on organizational attention?"

Individual legitimacy comes from direct personal impact. If your house is next to a planned factory, you have individual legitimacy to voice concerns about noise and pollution. If you bought a defective product, you have legitimate claim to remedy.

Organizational legitimacy comes from formal relationships. Shareholders have ownership rights. Employees have contractual employment relationships. Suppliers have purchase agreements. These create legally and socially recognized claims.

Societal legitimacy comes from representing broader social interests. Environmental groups may have no direct property stake but society recognizes their legitimacy to advocate for environmental protection. NGOs representing disadvantaged groups have legitimacy even without formal organizational relationships.

The key insight: legitimacy is socially constructed. What counts as a "legitimate" claim varies by culture and context. In Vietnam, local government officials have high societal legitimacy even for private business decisions. In other contexts, they might not.

A stakeholder can have multiple legitimacy sources simultaneously. Employees have both individual (personal livelihood) and organizational (contractual) legitimacy.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Urgency Types">

## Sources of Stakeholder Urgency

**Time-Critical** – Deadline-driven claims
- Regulatory compliance deadlines
- Contract expiration dates
- Fiscal reporting periods

**Criticality** – Importance regardless of timing
- Safety hazards requiring immediate action
- Threats to organizational survival
- Irreversible decisions

**Combined** – Both time-sensitive AND critical
- Product recall affecting consumer safety (immediate harm + deadline)
- Financial crisis threatening bankruptcy (survival + time pressure)
- Environmental disaster requiring emergency response (safety + urgency)

<speaker-notes>
Urgency adds temporal dimension to stakeholder salience. Some claims can wait; others cannot.

Time-critical urgency comes from external deadlines. Regulatory filings have legal deadlines - miss them and face penalties. Contracts expire. Quarterly earnings must be reported. These create urgency even if underlying issues are routine.

Criticality urgency comes from severity of consequences. A safety hazard creates urgency even without external deadlines - the potential harm demands immediate attention. Threats to organizational survival create urgency regardless of specific timeframes.

Combined urgency is highest priority. Product recalls combine both: immediate consumer safety risk (criticality) AND regulatory reporting deadlines (time-critical). Financial crises combine survival threat with time pressure from markets and creditors.

Vietnamese context: Tet holiday creates time-critical urgency for any business decisions affecting employee schedules or customer service - delays become impossible to resolve for weeks.

Important: Urgency is often situational and temporary. A stakeholder may have low urgency normally but high urgency during specific events or crises. Mitchell's model requires continuous reassessment.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="Seven Stakeholder Types">

## Mitchell's Seven-Part Typology

| Classification | Attributes | Priority Level | Example |
|----------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| **Dormant** | Power only | Low | Wealthy former customer |
| **Discretionary** | Legitimacy only | Low | Local charity seeking donation |
| **Demanding** | Urgency only | Low | Lone protestor without legitimacy |
| **Dominant** | Power + Legitimacy | Moderate | Major shareholder |
| **Dangerous** | Power + Urgency | Moderate | Activist group threatening action |
| **Dependent** | Legitimacy + Urgency | Moderate | Employees affected by urgent issue |
| **Definitive** | All three | **High** | Regulator enforcing compliance deadline |

<speaker-notes>
This table operationalizes the framework. Each row represents a different combination of the three attributes.

Dormant stakeholders have power but lack legitimacy or urgency. Think of a wealthy individual who could invest but hasn't expressed interest - they could matter but currently don't.

Discretionary stakeholders have legitimate claims but no power or urgency. Charities requesting donations have legitimate social missions but can't force contributions and rarely face deadlines that affect the company.

Demanding stakeholders claim urgency but lack power and legitimacy. A single person protesting without broader support or valid grievance creates noise but requires minimal attention.

Moderate-salience stakeholders have two attributes. Dominant stakeholders (power + legitimacy) like major shareholders expect regular communication and influence. Dangerous stakeholders (power + urgency) like activist groups with media access require careful handling. Dependent stakeholders (legitimacy + urgency) like employees facing restructuring need advocacy from others since they lack power.

Definitive stakeholders command immediate, sustained attention. A government regulator enforcing an environmental compliance deadline has all three: power (legal authority), legitimacy (protecting public interest), and urgency (deadline). These stakeholders get top priority.

Key insight: classifications are dynamic. A dormant stakeholder can become definitive if they gain legitimacy and urgency. Stakeholder management means monitoring these shifts.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Dynamic Stakeholder Status">

## Critical Insight: Salience Changes

**Stakeholder status is:**
- **Dynamic** – can increase or decrease over time
- **Perception-based** – depends on managerial awareness
- **Context-dependent** – varies by situation

**Examples of Status Changes:**

- Employees gain urgency during labor disputes (Dependent → Definitive)
- Media gains power during crisis (Discretionary → Dangerous)
- Customers lose urgency after product launch (Definitive → Dominant)
- Communities gain legitimacy through organizing (Demanding → Dependent)

<speaker-notes>
This is one of Mitchell's most important contributions: stakeholder salience is not static. Organizations must continuously reassess.

Perception-based salience means if managers don't recognize a stakeholder's attributes, that stakeholder won't receive attention regardless of actual salience. This explains corporate blind spots - failure to perceive growing power, legitimacy, or urgency until too late.

Context changes salience dramatically. During normal operations, environmental groups may be discretionary stakeholders. During an oil spill, they become definitive with power (media influence), legitimacy (environmental protection), and urgency (immediate harm).

Vietnamese context example: During COVID-19, employee health became urgently important, shifting employees from dominant to definitive stakeholders for workplace safety decisions. Companies that recognized this shift adapted communication quickly. Those that didn't faced morale and retention problems.

The fourth example shows how stakeholder action affects salience. Individual community members (demanding - urgency only) who organize into a formal group gain legitimacy, becoming dependent stakeholders who deserve attention.

The framework's value: it forces systematic reassessment rather than relying on intuition about who matters.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="Mitchell Example - Product Recall">

## Example: Product Recall Scenario

**Situation:** A Vietnamese electronics company discovers 5% of products have battery defects

**Stakeholder Salience Analysis:**

| Stakeholder | Power | Legitimacy | Urgency | Classification | Priority |
|-------------|-------|------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Customers | High | High | High | **Definitive** | **Immediate** |
| Regulators | High | High | High | **Definitive** | **Immediate** |
| Media | High | Low | Moderate | Dangerous | High |
| Suppliers | Moderate | High | Low | Dominant | Moderate |
| Investors | High | High | Low | Dominant | Moderate |

**Communication priority:** Customers and regulators first (safety + compliance)

<speaker-notes>
This scenario makes the framework actionable. Product recalls are high-stakes situations requiring rapid stakeholder triage.

Customers are definitive: they have power (can sue, switch brands, damage reputation), legitimacy (purchased the product, deserve safety), and urgency (potential harm now). They require immediate, direct communication with clear instructions.

Regulators are also definitive: they have power (can impose fines, mandate recalls), legitimacy (legal mandate to protect consumers), and urgency (compliance deadlines). Failure to communicate promptly invites penalties.

Media have power (public narrative control) and moderate urgency (news cycle) but lack formal legitimacy - they're observers, not affected parties. They're dangerous stakeholders: ignore them and they use their power negatively. Engage proactively with transparency.

Suppliers have legitimacy (business partners) and moderate power (supply chain control) but low urgency - the recall affects current products, not future manufacturing. They need information but not immediately.

Investors have power (capital) and legitimacy (ownership stake) but low urgency - financial impacts unfold over time. They deserve thorough briefing but after safety communications.

This prioritization framework prevents the common mistake of addressing investors or media before customers and regulators. Lives and legal compliance come before stock price management.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Applying Mitchell - Communication Sequence">

## Product Recall Communication Sequence

**Phase 1: Definitive Stakeholders (First 24 hours)**
1. **Customers** – Direct communication, return instructions, safety guidance
2. **Regulators** – Formal notification, compliance plan, timeline

**Phase 2: Dangerous/Dominant Stakeholders (24-48 hours)**
3. **Media** – Press release, spokesperson availability, transparency commitment
4. **Employees** – Internal briefing, customer service protocols, Q&A

**Phase 3: Lower Salience (48-72 hours)**
5. **Investors** – Impact assessment, financial implications, mitigation strategy
6. **Suppliers** – Quality review process, contract implications
7. **Retailers** – Inventory management, point-of-sale messaging

<speaker-notes>
This slide shows how Mitchell's framework translates into actual communication planning with specific timing.

Phase 1 addresses definitive stakeholders immediately. Customer communication happens within hours: email to registered users, website notification, media alerts, retailer notifications. Regulator communication follows legal protocols with formal filings and response plans.

Phase 2 addresses stakeholders who could amplify or damage response. Media communication should be proactive - issue press release before journalists start calling. Employee communication ensures frontline staff can answer customer questions consistently.

Phase 3 addresses important stakeholders whose needs are less time-critical. Investors need thorough analysis, not rushed speculation. Suppliers need to understand quality processes but aren't managing immediate safety risk.

Vietnamese context: Add government relations to Phase 1 if product sold domestically. Vietnamese regulatory environment often requires government stakeholder engagement even before public announcement.

The sequencing prevents common failures: announcing to media before customers (customers learn from news, not company), telling investors before employees (staff blindsided), or delaying regulator notification (legal violations).

This is the kind of systematic stakeholder communication planning students will practice in tutorials and apply in the Week 4 memo assessment.

<slide number="23" layout="section-break" title="Part 3 Introduction">

## Part 3: Message Adaptation

**The Execution Question:** How do I actually communicate differently with different audiences?

<speaker-notes>
Transition to Part 3. Freeman identified stakeholders, Mitchell prioritized them - now we need practical tools for adapting our messages.

This section introduces two complementary approaches: stakeholder mapping matrices (from McKinsey's EDGE framework) and Duarte's audience calibration for presentation content.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" title="McKinsey EDGE Framework">

## EDGE Framework for Stakeholder Engagement

**E**xpanded – Embrace role as bridge between organization and external world

**D**istinctive – Become storyteller-in-chief with singular, compelling narrative

**G**rowth-oriented – Empower team of ambassadors throughout organization

**E**ngaged – Maintain consistent communication drumbeat across stakeholder groups

**Source:** McKinsey & Company (2024) – CEO research with Microsoft, Nissan, Adidas, US Bancorp leaders

<speaker-notes>
This framework comes from November 2024 McKinsey research interviewing CEOs at major global companies. It synthesizes how successful leaders approach stakeholder engagement.

Expanded thinking: Leaders must see themselves as connectors. Richard Davis, former US Bancorp CEO, calls this "the Holy Grail" - having 12 management team members who are equal voices and storytellers. You can't be the only communicator.

Distinctive narrative: You need ONE clear story that adapts to contexts while maintaining consistency. This connects to the Four W's framework on the next slide.

Growth-oriented ambassador development: Train your team to communicate your message. Only 25% of employees feel inspired by leaders, partly because too few leaders delegate communication responsibilities.

Engaged communication drumbeat: Consistency matters more than perfection. Regular, predictable communication builds trust even when messages are challenging.

Key statistic: Organizations successful at policy shaping are nearly 5x more likely to train executives on external engagement. Communication competence is learnable and teachable.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Four W's Narrative Framework">

## Four W's: Building Your Core Narrative

**WHO** – Your personal leadership journey and aspirations

**WHY** – Organization's reason for existence and contribution to society

**WHAT** – Strategic agenda in simple, compelling terms

**WHEN** – Timing of communication rollout and milestones

**Application:** Develop this narrative once, adapt for different stakeholders

<speaker-notes>
The Four W's create the foundational story you'll adapt for different audiences. It's not four separate narratives - it's one coherent story with four essential components.

WHO establishes personal connection. Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida emphasized emotional engagement: "Employees don't remember what you said or achieved, but they do remember how you made them feel." Your personal journey humanizes the message.

WHY connects to purpose beyond profit. Vietnamese students often respond to social contribution stories - how does this initiative improve lives, communities, or the environment?

WHAT translates strategy into accessible language. Avoid jargon like "synergistic optimization of cross-functional deliverables." Say "we're combining teams to serve customers faster."

WHEN provides clarity on milestones and expectations. Uncertainty creates anxiety; clear timing builds confidence.

Example adaptation: For investors, emphasize WHAT (strategic direction) and WHEN (milestones). For employees, emphasize WHY (purpose) and WHO (your commitment to them). Same core narrative, different emphasis.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="framework" title="Stakeholder Mapping Matrix">

## Stakeholder Mapping Matrix

| **Internal Stakeholders** | **External Stakeholders** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| C-suite executives | Shareholders/investors |
| Employees | Media |
| Board of directors | Local community |
| Business unit leaders | Government/regulators |
| | Suppliers |
| | Customers |

**Use:** Ensure comprehensive coverage - no stakeholder group overlooked

<speaker-notes>
This simple matrix from the McKinsey research ensures systematic stakeholder identification. It combines Freeman's comprehensive view with practical categorization.

Internal/external distinction matters for communication approach. Internal stakeholders typically receive more frequent, detailed communication through organizational channels. External stakeholders need more formal, structured engagement.

Use this as a checklist when planning communication strategies. Go through each cell and ask: "Have we considered this group? What do they need to know? When? Through what channel?"

Vietnamese organizational context: Internal stakeholders often include family members in family-owned businesses. External stakeholders increasingly include social media influencers who shape public perception.

The matrix prevents the common mistake of focusing only on customers and investors while neglecting employees, communities, or regulators until problems arise.

<slide number="27" title="Duarte Audience Calibration">

## Nancy Duarte's Audience Calibration Framework

**Context:** Nancy Duarte – leading presentation expert (author of *Resonate*, clients include Apple, Google, TED)

**Core Principle:** Match content type to audience preferences

**Aristotelian Appeals Updated for Business:**

- **Logos** (Logical): Data, statistics, reasoned arguments
- **Pathos** (Emotional): Stories, metaphors, imagination-stirring content
- **Ethos** (Credibility): Character, trustworthiness, expertise

**The Calibration Question:** What ratio of logos to pathos does this audience need?

<speaker-notes>
Duarte connects classical rhetoric to modern business presentation. This framework appeared in MIT Sloan Management Review (August 2024) and provides research-backed guidance.

Aristotle identified three persuasive appeals 2,300 years ago. They remain foundational because they address how humans process information and make decisions.

Logos appeals to our rational, analytical side. "The data shows 15% improvement." Engineers, scientists, and finance professionals typically prefer high logos content.

Pathos appeals to emotion and values. "Imagine what this means for families struggling with healthcare costs." Creatives, marketers, and salespeople often respond better to emotional resonance.

Ethos establishes why the audience should trust you. Credentials, character, citing respected sources. All audiences need some ethos, but it's foundational rather than the primary content.

The key insight: "When you show up with emotional or analytical energy that doesn't match the audience's, it hurts your credibility." A data-heavy presentation to a creative team feels tone-deaf. An emotional appeal to engineers feels manipulative.

Next slide shows how to calibrate systematically.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="28" title="Audience Calibration Matrix">

## Calibrating Content for Audience Types

| Audience Type | Characteristics | Recommended Approach |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Analytical** | Engineers, scientists, finance, data analysts | Lead with data; use emotional appeal "lightly and with intention" |
| **Emotionally-driven** | Sales teams, creatives, marketers, HR | Reduce analytical content; "they likely won't want 20 slides with charts" |
| **Mixed** | Cross-functional teams, executive committees, general audiences | Blend both approaches strategically; lead with logos, support with pathos |

**Process:**
1. Research your specific audience before presenting
2. Audit existing content (logos vs. pathos inventory)
3. Adjust ratio to match audience preferences

<speaker-notes>
This table operationalizes Duarte's framework for different professional contexts.

Analytical audiences need logical structure and evidence. They're skeptical of unsupported claims. For engineering teams, open with data, use clear causation, minimize storytelling. Emotional content should highlight practical benefits, not abstract inspiration.

Emotionally-driven audiences want human connection and vision. A sales team doesn't need 20 charts - they need compelling narratives they can retell to customers. Marketing professionals respond to brand stories and customer impact.

Mixed audiences are most challenging because preferences vary. Executive committees typically include both CFOs (highly analytical) and CMOs (more emotional). Strategy: lead with logical structure and data for credibility, then use stories to make it memorable and actionable.

Content inventory method (Duarte recommends): Go through your presentation and label each slide or section as primarily analytical (A) or emotional (E). Count them. If you're presenting to engineers with 60% emotional content, recalibrate. If you're presenting to salespeople with 80% charts, add stories.

Vietnamese context: Business education often emphasizes analytical approaches. Students may need encouragement to develop emotional appeal competency, particularly for stakeholder groups like communities or employees where human connection matters.

Common student question: "What if I'm naturally analytical/emotional?" Answer: Develop both capabilities. Effective communicators flex to audience needs rather than defaulting to personal preferences.

<slide number="29" title="Content Types">

## Analytical vs. Emotional Content Types

**Analytical Content (Logos):**
- Statistical data and quantified results
- Charts, graphs, diagrams
- Expert quotations and research citations
- Logical argument structures
- Technical demonstrations
- Appendices with supporting data

**Emotional Content (Pathos):**
- Anecdotes and personal stories
- Metaphors and analogies
- Evocative photographs or videos
- Humor (when appropriate)
- Benefits framing ("imagine when...")
- Suspenseful reveals or dramatic structure

<speaker-notes>
Use this as a checklist when auditing presentation content. Each slide or section should be categorizable as primarily analytical or emotional.

Analytical content can be boring if overused, but it builds credibility and provides substance. The key is clarity - dense charts without clear insights frustrate rather than persuade.

Emotional content creates connection and memorability, but overuse can feel manipulative or fluffy. Stories need purpose - they should illustrate concepts, not distract from them.

The art is integration: use a story to introduce a problem (pathos), then show data proving the problem's scope (logos), then use an anecdote showing human impact (pathos again). This sandwich approach works for mixed audiences.

Vietnamese students often excel at analytical content but sometimes hesitate to use emotional appeals, viewing them as less professional. Clarify: emotional appeal isn't manipulation when authentic. Uchida's point about employees remembering feelings applies to all communication - pure data rarely inspires action.

Example: "Our customer satisfaction score improved 15%" (analytical) becomes "Our customer satisfaction score improved 15% - that's 3,000 customers who now trust us to deliver on promises" (analytical + emotional). The number gains human meaning.

<slide number="30" title="Calibration Examples">

## Audience Calibration in Practice

**Scenario:** Proposing sustainability initiative to different audiences

**To Engineering Team (Analytical):**
- "Solar panels reduce energy costs 23% annually"
- "Payback period: 4.2 years based on current utility rates"
- Technical specifications and efficiency calculations
- ROI model with sensitivity analysis

**To Marketing Team (Emotional):**
- "Imagine telling customers we're 100% renewable"
- "This positions us as environmental leaders in our industry"
- Competitor sustainability commitments and brand reputation
- Customer sentiment data on environmental values

**To Executive Committee (Mixed):**
- "Solar investment pays back in 4.2 years (logos) AND positions our brand as sustainability leader (pathos)"
- Financial model (logos) + competitive differentiation story (pathos)
- Risk analysis (logos) + stakeholder impact narrative (pathos)

<speaker-notes>
Same initiative, three different communication approaches calibrated to audience preferences.

Engineering team presentation: Lead with numbers and technical viability. Engineers respect data-driven decision-making. Show calculations, efficiency specs, technical implementation details. The emotional appeal ("good for environment") is secondary to financial and technical logic.

Marketing team presentation: Lead with brand story and customer perception. Marketers think about positioning, differentiation, and customer relationships. Show how this supports brand values, creates marketing opportunities, differentiates from competitors. The financial case matters but isn't the compelling story.

Executive committee presentation: Integrate both approaches. Executives need financial logic (CFO perspective) AND strategic positioning (CMO perspective). The presentation leads with financial case for credibility, then layers in strategic benefits for buy-in.

Notice the same facts appear in all three versions - the calibration is emphasis and framing, not invention of different information.

This is exactly what students practice in Week 4 Business Memo - same scenario, message adapted for different stakeholder audiences using framework-informed calibration.

Key lesson: Effective communication requires audience analysis BEFORE message creation. Don't create one presentation and force it on all audiences - analyze audiences, then calibrate content accordingly.

<slide number="31" title="Channel Selection">

## Matching Communication Channels to Stakeholders

**High-Stakes, High-Complexity Messages:**
- Face-to-face meetings, video calls
- Allows real-time dialogue, clarification, nuance
- Best for: Regulators, major investors, senior executives

**Moderate-Stakes, Moderate-Complexity:**
- Email with attachments, formal letters, presentations
- Provides documentation, allows considered response
- Best for: Employees, suppliers, business partners

**Lower-Stakes, Broad Reach:**
- Press releases, social media, website updates
- Maximizes reach, maintains transparency
- Best for: General public, media, customers

**Principle:** Match channel richness to message complexity and stakeholder priority

<speaker-notes>
This slide addresses the often-overlooked question: WHAT channel should we use for each stakeholder group?

Media richness theory (Daft & Lengel) suggests matching communication channel to message complexity and equivocality. Rich channels (face-to-face) handle complex, ambiguous messages. Lean channels (written) work for simple, clear messages.

High-stakes stakeholders deserve rich channels. You don't email a regulator about a compliance violation - you schedule a meeting, bring documentation, and discuss face-to-face. You don't announce restructuring to employees via memo - you hold town halls with Q&A.

Moderate-complexity messages work well in writing. Contract changes with suppliers can be emailed with clear documentation. Employee policy updates can be announced via email with FAQ attached.

Broad-reach messages use lean channels. Press releases work for media because journalists will follow up with questions. Social media works for customers because it's where they already engage. Website updates provide permanent reference.

Vietnamese context: Face-to-face channels carry extra weight culturally. Hierarchical relationships often require in-person meetings even for moderately complex messages. Email alone may feel disrespectful for senior stakeholders.

Common mistake: Using lean channels for high-stakes messages to save time. Announcing layoffs via email is efficient but damages trust and morale. Major stakeholder changes deserve rich communication investment.

Integration with Mitchell: Definitive stakeholders typically deserve richer channels. Discretionary stakeholders can receive leaner channel communication.

## Putting It All Together: Communication Strategy Development

**Step 1:** Identify stakeholders (Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke)

**Step 2:** Prioritize by salience (Mitchell's Power-Legitimacy-Urgency)

**Step 3:** Map stakeholders (Internal/External Matrix)

**Step 4:** Develop core narrative (Four W's)

**Step 5:** Adapt content for each audience (Duarte's Calibration)

**Step 6:** Select appropriate channels (Richness matching)

**Result:** Systematic, evidence-based stakeholder communication

<speaker-notes>
This slide synthesizes all frameworks into a repeatable process. In practice, these steps often happen iteratively rather than linearly, but this sequence provides structure.

Start broad with Freeman - who are ALL potential stakeholders? Then narrow with Mitchell - which ones matter most right now? Map them systematically to ensure comprehensive coverage. Develop your core narrative using the Four W's. Adapt that narrative's content ratio for each stakeholder type using Duarte's calibration. Finally, select channels that match message complexity and stakeholder priority.

Example application: Announcing organizational restructuring.

Step 1 (Freeman): Stakeholders include employees, customers, investors, regulators, media, suppliers, communities.

Step 2 (Mitchell): Employees are definitive (power through talent retention, legitimacy as affected parties, urgency about job security). Investors are dominant (power + legitimacy, lower urgency). Media are dangerous (power + urgency, questionable legitimacy).

Step 3 (Map): Internal = employees, executives, board. External = investors, media, customers, regulators.

Step 4 (Four W's): WHO = your commitment to transparency. WHY = organization needs to serve customers more effectively. WHAT = specific changes and timeline. WHEN = communication schedule and restructuring phases.

Step 5 (Calibrate): For employees (mixed analytical/emotional), combine clear facts about changes with empathy for concerns. For investors (analytical), emphasize financial rationale and efficiency gains. For media (emotional), frame around customer benefit story.

Step 6 (Channel): Employees get town hall meetings (rich channel for high stakes). Investors get formal presentation and written materials (moderate richness, documentation). Media get press release with spokesperson availability (lean channel, broad reach).

This systematic approach prevents common failures: forgetting stakeholders, treating all audiences identically, or defaulting to one-size-fits-all communication.

<slide number="33" title="Common Pitfalls">

## Common Stakeholder Communication Failures

**1. One-Size-Fits-All Messaging**
- Same content, tone, channel for all audiences
- Ignores different information needs and preferences
- Example: Technical jargon in customer-facing communication

**2. Stakeholder Blindness**
- Failing to identify non-obvious but important stakeholders
- Surprise resistance from overlooked groups
- Example: Community opposition to expansion (no early consultation)

**3. Priority Misalignment**
- Addressing low-salience stakeholders before high-salience
- Violates trust when critical groups learn second-hand
- Example: Media announcement before employee notification

**4. Static Assessment**
- Treating stakeholder salience as fixed
- Missing shifts in power, legitimacy, or urgency
- Example: Activist group gains media attention (Demanding → Dangerous)

<speaker-notes>
Learning from failures is often more powerful than learning from successes. These four pitfalls appear repeatedly in business communication case studies.

One-size-fits-all messaging is the most common failure. Organizations create one announcement and blast it to all stakeholders. Employees receive investor-focused financial language. Communities receive corporate jargon. Customers receive internal acronyms. Result: confusion, mistrust, and ineffectiveness. The frameworks we've covered today solve this by forcing audience-specific adaptation.

Stakeholder blindness happens when environmental scanning is superficial. Companies identify obvious stakeholders (customers, investors) but miss less obvious ones (local communities, NGOs, political groups). Then they're surprised by opposition. Freeman's hub-and-spoke model prevents this by forcing systematic identification.

Priority misalignment creates trust violations. When employees learn about restructuring from media reports instead of management communication, they feel disrespected and betrayed. When regulators discover issues through whistleblowers instead of company disclosure, they increase scrutiny and penalties. Mitchell's framework prevents this by determining communication sequence.

Static assessment treats today's stakeholder salience as permanent. But power, legitimacy, and urgency shift constantly. Social media gave customers new power. Environmental movements increased NGO legitimacy. Crises create urgency. Organizations that don't continuously reassess miss critical shifts until too late.

Vietnamese examples: Many Vietnamese companies experienced stakeholder blindness during COVID-19, underestimating government's urgency around workplace safety (shifted from dominant to definitive stakeholder). Companies that recognized this shift early adapted communication and avoided compliance problems.

The good news: All four pitfalls are preventable with systematic framework application.

<slide number="34" title="Cultural Considerations">

## Stakeholder Communication in Vietnamese Context

**Power Distance Implications:**
- Government stakeholders carry heightened power and legitimacy
- Hierarchical communication protocols matter
- Face-to-face channels for senior stakeholders preferred

**Collective Orientation:**
- Community and family stakeholder groups have high legitimacy
- Group harmony affects stakeholder priorities
- Indirect communication styles for conflict-sensitive topics

**Relationship-Based Business:**
- Stakeholder relationships built over time, not transactional
- Personal connections affect power dynamics
- Trust-building precedes substantive communication

**Practical Adjustments:**
- Add government relations to high-salience stakeholders
- Consider family stakeholders in SME contexts
- Budget extra time for relationship cultivation before asks

<speaker-notes>
While Freeman, Mitchell, and Duarte's frameworks are universal, their APPLICATION must consider cultural context. Vietnam's cultural dimensions affect stakeholder dynamics.

Power distance (Hofstede): Vietnam scores high on power distance, meaning hierarchical relationships are respected and expected. This affects stakeholder salience. Government stakeholders have enhanced power and legitimacy compared to Western contexts. Even local government officials may be definitive stakeholders for decisions that would be purely private in low-power-distance cultures.

Communication protocols reflect this: formal language for government stakeholders, face-to-face meetings for senior figures, careful attention to titles and status. Email alone may feel disrespectful.

Collective orientation: Vietnamese culture prioritizes group harmony and collective interests. This gives community stakeholder groups heightened legitimacy. Family members of employees may be stakeholders in ways Western frameworks don't anticipate. Decisions affecting individuals affect families and communities.

Relationship-based business (guanxi influence): Stakeholder relationships are cultivated over time through repeated interaction and trust-building. You can't treat stakeholder communication as purely transactional. A supplier with long-standing relationship may have more power than economic analysis suggests because of accumulated trust and reciprocity.

Practical implications for students: When applying frameworks to Vietnamese scenarios, adjust stakeholder salience assessment for cultural factors. Government stakeholders often rank higher. Community legitimacy carries more weight. Personal relationships affect power dynamics beyond formal authority.

The frameworks remain valid - cultural context affects HOW you apply them, not WHETHER to use them.

<slide number="35" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways

**1. Stakeholder Identification (Freeman)**
- Organizations exist in webs of relationships with diverse stakeholder groups
- Stakeholders include anyone who can affect or is affected by decisions
- Systematic identification prevents blind spots

**2. Stakeholder Prioritization (Mitchell)**
- Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency determine stakeholder salience
- Definitive stakeholders (all three attributes) demand immediate attention
- Salience is dynamic and context-dependent - monitor continuously

**3. Message Adaptation**
- Use stakeholder mapping to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Develop core narrative (Four W's) and adapt for contexts
- Calibrate logos/pathos ratio to match audience preferences
- Match channel richness to message complexity and stakeholder priority

**4. Integration**
- Combine frameworks into systematic communication strategy
- Test: Can you identify, prioritize, map, calibrate, and channel-match for all stakeholder groups?

<speaker-notes>
Four main takeaways corresponding to the three frameworks plus integration and channel selection.

Freeman's contribution: expanded business thinking beyond shareholders to full stakeholder ecosystems. This shift transformed corporate communication from narrow investor relations to comprehensive stakeholder engagement.

Mitchell's contribution: operationalized Freeman with the Power-Legitimacy-Urgency framework, giving managers systematic prioritization methodology. No longer guess who matters most - assess attributes objectively.

Message adaptation tools: McKinsey's EDGE and mapping provide strategic structure, Duarte's calibration provides tactical content guidance, channel selection ensures appropriate medium. Together they answer "how do I actually communicate differently?"

Integration emphasis: these aren't separate frameworks to choose between - they work together. Freeman without Mitchell leads to paralysis (too many stakeholders, no priorities). Mitchell without Duarte leads to right priorities but wrong messages. Great strategy with poor channel selection wastes effort. Use all systematically.

Students should be able to apply this process: "Given a business scenario, identify stakeholders using Freeman, prioritize using Mitchell, map using internal/external matrix, develop narrative using Four W's, calibrate content using Duarte for each group, and select appropriate channels."

This process appears in the Week 4 Business Memo assessment. Tutorial practice today builds competency.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="36" title="Assessment Preview">

## Week 4: Business Memo

**The Assignment:**
- Analyze a communication challenge using stakeholder frameworks
- Map stakeholders and their needs
- Propose audience-adapted communication strategy
- 500-750 words

**Preparation Path:**
- **Today's lecture:** Stakeholder identification and prioritization frameworks
- **Today's tutorial:** Practice stakeholder mapping on sample scenario
- **Week 3 lecture:** Pyramid Principle for message structure
- **Week 3 tutorial:** Draft memo outline
- **Week 4:** Submit final Business Memo

**Success criteria:** Framework application (30%), Strategic thinking (25%), Organization (20%)

<speaker-notes>
Connect today's learning directly to upcoming assessment. Students appreciate seeing the clear progression.

The Business Memo assessment requires demonstrating competency with Freeman's identification and Mitchell's prioritization frameworks. You'll analyze a scenario (choose from options in Assessment Handbook), identify stakeholders, prioritize using Power-Legitimacy-Urgency, and propose adapted communication approaches.

Emphasize the preparation timeline: Today you learn the frameworks. Tutorial lets you practice on a scenario. Week 3 adds Pyramid Principle for structure. By Week 4, you're combining stakeholder analysis with clear writing structure.

Students who skip tutorial practice consistently struggle with the assessment. The tutorial scenario is similar to assessment options - use it to test your understanding in a low-stakes environment.

Rubric criteria come from Assessment Handbook Section 1. Framework application (30%) means accurately using Freeman and Mitchell - not just mentioning them but demonstrating understanding. Strategic thinking (25%) means your analysis leads to actionable communication recommendations.

Office hours available for draft feedback - encourage students to come in Week 3 with questions.

## Week 3: Structured Business Writing

**Topic:** Pyramid Principle & SCQA Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Top-down communication structure (Pyramid Principle)
- SCQA: Situation-Complication-Question-Answer
- Executive summary format
- Clarity and concision techniques

**Why this matters:**
- Week 4 Business Memo requires Pyramid structure
- Professional writing starts with conclusions, not buildup
- Busy executives need main point first

**Pre-reading:** Minto, B. (2010). *The Pyramid Principle* (Ch. 1-3)

<speaker-notes>
Set expectations for Week 3. While this week focused on WHO to communicate with and HOW to adapt, next week focuses on HOW to structure messages for clarity and impact.

The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, McKinsey) revolutionized business writing by advocating top-down structure: start with the answer, then provide supporting points. This contrasts with academic writing that builds to conclusions.

SCQA framework (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) provides structure for opening paragraphs that immediately engage readers.

Connection to assessment: Week 4 memo requires both stakeholder analysis (this week) AND Pyramid structure (next week). They work together - stakeholder analysis tells you what to say to whom, Pyramid Principle tells you how to structure it.

The pre-reading is from Minto's classic text. It's challenging but essential. Encourage students to read actively with examples in mind.
