<!-- Slide 1: Hook -->
## Only 12% of CEOs Feel Successful at Stakeholder Communication
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

Despite 58% viewing it as a top priority

*Source: McKinsey & Company, 2024*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Start with silence for 3 seconds to let the number sink in
- "Good morning. Let's start with a striking contradiction"

**Key Points:**
- This is from McKinsey's November 2024 research on CEO communication
- The gap: 58% say it's critical, but only 12% feel they do it well
- This isn't about incompetent leaders—these are experienced executives
- The problem: stakeholder communication is harder than it looks

**Example/Story:**
- Think about group projects: you know who your team members are, but do you know what each person needs to hear to stay motivated? That's stakeholder management at small scale.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick poll: How many of you have felt like you explained something clearly, but people still misunderstood? Keep that feeling in mind."

**Transition:**
- "Today we're learning the systematic approach that closes this gap"

---

<!-- Slide 2: Objectives -->
## Today's Learning Objectives
<!-- LAYOUT: standard -->

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** stakeholders using Freeman's stakeholder theory
2. **Prioritize** stakeholders using Mitchell's power-legitimacy-urgency framework
3. **Analyze** audience needs to adapt messages effectively
4. **Apply** stakeholder mapping to real business scenarios

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These aren't just academic concepts—they're CEO-level frameworks you'll use in Week 4"

**Key Points:**
- Identify = know who matters (Freeman gives us categories)
- Prioritize = know who matters MOST (Mitchell tells us how to rank)
- Analyze = understand what each audience needs
- Apply = put it all together in practical situations

**Example/Story:**
- Your Business Memo in Week 4 will require identifying stakeholders, analyzing their needs, and adapting your message accordingly

**Check Understanding:**
- Point to the objectives on screen: "Notice the verbs—identify, prioritize, analyze, apply. We're building skills, not just learning definitions."

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect this to your graded work"

---

<!-- Slide 3: Assessment Connection -->
## How This Prepares You: Business Memo (Week 4)
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Week 2 (Today):** Learn stakeholder frameworks
↓
**Week 2 Tutorial:** Map stakeholders for a case scenario
↓
**Week 3:** Structured writing principles
↓
**Week 4:** Apply both to Business Memo (10% of grade)

**The memo requires:**
- Stakeholder identification
- Audience needs analysis
- Message adaptation for specific reader

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is your roadmap from today to your first graded assignment"

**Key Points:**
- Today you learn the frameworks theoretically
- Tutorial gives you practice with feedback
- Week 3 adds writing structure (Pyramid Principle)
- Week 4 you combine both skills in graded work
- The memo is worth 10%—not huge, but it builds foundation for 15% proposal later

**Example/Story:**
- Think of it like learning to drive: today is the theory test, tutorial is practice in parking lot, Week 4 is your actual road test

**Check Understanding:**
- "Does this progression make sense? Theory → Practice → Graded work?"

**Transition:**
- "Now let's see where we're going in the next hour"

<!-- Slide 4: Roadmap -->
## Today's Journey
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

**PART 1:** Who Are Your Stakeholders? (15 min)
Freeman's foundational framework

**PART 2:** Who Matters Most? (20 min)
Mitchell's prioritization model

**PART 3:** How to Adapt Your Message (20 min)
Duarte's audience calibration + McKinsey's EDGE framework

**WRAP-UP:** Integration & Next Steps (5 min)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Three questions drive today's content: Who? Who matters most? How do I adapt?"

**Key Points:**
- Part 1 = breadth (cast wide net)
- Part 2 = depth (focus limited resources)
- Part 3 = execution (actually communicate)
- We're moving from theory to application across these segments

**Example/Story:**
- Like planning a wedding: Part 1 = everyone you could invite, Part 2 = who sits at the head table, Part 3 = how you talk to your grandmother vs. your college friends

**Check Understanding:**
- "Any questions before we dive into Part 1?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with the foundational question: who are your stakeholders?"

---

<!-- CORE CONTENT: PART 1 - FREEMAN'S STAKEHOLDER THEORY -->

<!-- Slide 5: Part 1 Section Break -->
## PART 1: Who Are Your Stakeholders?
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

Freeman's Stakeholder Theory (1984)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "First question: when you're making a business decision, who do you need to think about?"

**Key Points:**
- R. Edward Freeman published the seminal book in 1984
- It's been cited over 100,000 times—this is THE foundation
- Before Freeman, businesses mainly thought about shareholders
- Freeman said: that's too narrow, you need a wider view

**Example/Story:**
- Imagine you're managing a coffee shop. Before Freeman, you'd think: "How do I make money for the owner?" After Freeman: "Who else is affected—employees, customers, suppliers, neighbors, health inspectors?"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Who can name a group besides shareholders that a business should care about?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see Freeman's systematic answer"

---

<!-- Slide 6: Freeman's Definition -->
## Freeman's Stakeholder Definition
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "A stakeholder in an organization is any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives"

**R. Edward Freeman, 1984**

**Key insight:** Affect OR affected by (two-way relationship)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Read this definition carefully—there are two critical words"

**Key Points:**
- "Can AFFECT" = they have power over you (investors pull funding, government regulates)
- "IS AFFECTED BY" = you have impact on them (employees lose jobs in layoff, community affected by pollution)
- It's bidirectional—not just "who can hurt us" but also "who do we impact"
- This is why it's called stakeholder THEORY—it redefined how we think about business responsibility

**Example/Story:**
- Vietnamese coffee farmers: they affect Starbucks (quality, supply), and Starbucks affects them (prices, contracts, livelihoods)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can someone give an example of a stakeholder who affects the organization? Now one who IS affected by it?"

**Transition:**
- "Freeman didn't stop at the definition—he gave us categories"

---

<!-- Slide 7: Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke Model -->
## Freeman's 11 Stakeholder Categories
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Internal:**
- Employees
- Shareholders
- Management

**External:**
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Financiers
- Communities
- Government/Regulators
- Political groups
- Trade associations
- Competitors
- Media

*Non-exhaustive—your organization may have others*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Freeman organized stakeholders into this hub-and-spoke model—organization at center, groups radiating out"

**Key Points:**
- Internal stakeholders: directly part of the organization
- External: outside but connected
- Customers are obvious, but notice COMPETITORS—they affect your strategy
- Media shapes public perception
- Political groups (think environmental activists, consumer advocates)
- This list is from 1984—today you might add social media influencers, online reviewers

**Example/Story:**
- For a Vietnamese tech startup: add government agencies (licensing), international investors, local university partners (recruitment), startup ecosystem (reputation)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Look at your phone. Pick any app. In 30 seconds, list 5 stakeholders for that company." [Pause] "Who wants to share?"

**Transition:**
- "Now here's the problem Freeman identified"

---

<!-- Slide 8: The Strategic Problem -->
## Why Stakeholder Mapping Matters
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Traditional View (Pre-Freeman):**
Maximize shareholder profit → Ignore other groups

**Freeman's Insight:**
Organizations exist in a web of relationships → Ignoring stakeholders creates risk

**Real Costs of Ignoring Stakeholders:**
- Employee strikes (ignored workforce)
- Product boycotts (ignored communities)
- Regulatory penalties (ignored government)
- Reputational damage (ignored media)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Freeman wasn't just being idealistic—he showed ignoring stakeholders is bad business"

**Key Points:**
- Milton Friedman (economist) said: company's only responsibility is profit
- Freeman said: that's dangerous and incomplete
- Real-world costs: Boeing 737 MAX ignored safety regulators and pilots → 346 deaths, $20 billion in losses
- Vietnam example: Grab ignored driver concerns → strikes in 2019

**Example/Story:**
- Fast fashion brands that ignored factory workers in Bangladesh: Rana Plaza collapse (2013), 1,100+ deaths, massive brand damage

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can anyone think of a Vietnamese company that faced problems because they ignored a stakeholder group?"

**Transition:**
- "So Freeman tells us WHO to think about. But we can't prioritize everyone equally—that's where Mitchell comes in"

---

<!-- CORE CONTENT: PART 2 - MITCHELL'S STAKEHOLDER SALIENCE MODEL -->

<!-- Slide 9: Part 2 Section Break -->
## PART 2: Who Matters Most?
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

Mitchell's Stakeholder Salience Model (1997)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Freeman gave us the full list. Mitchell answers: when resources are limited, who gets attention first?"

**Key Points:**
- Mitchell, Agle, & Wood published this in Academy of Management Review (1997)
- 12,197 citations—one of the most influential management articles
- "Salience" = prominence, importance, who stands out
- This operationalizes Freeman—makes it actionable

**Example/Story:**
- You're a CEO with 40 hours/week. You have 15 stakeholder groups. How do you allocate time? Mitchell gives you the algorithm.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why can't we just treat all stakeholders equally?" [Answer: limited time, money, attention]

**Transition:**
- "Mitchell's model uses three attributes to rank stakeholders"

---

<!-- Slide 10: Three Attributes of Stakeholder Salience -->
## Mitchell's Power-Legitimacy-Urgency Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**1. POWER**
Extent stakeholder can impose their will
*Examples:* Regulatory authority, economic leverage, voting rights

**2. LEGITIMACY**
Socially accepted and expected claim
*Examples:* Contractual rights, moral claims, legal standing

**3. URGENCY**
Time sensitivity and criticality of stakeholder's claim
*Examples:* Deadline-driven, safety-critical, crisis situations

**Salience = Number of attributes present**

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These three attributes combine to create stakeholder rankings"

**Key Points:**
- Power = CAN they make you do something? (not SHOULD they)
- Legitimacy = is their claim VALID in society's eyes?
- Urgency = does it need attention NOW?
- They're independent—you can have power without legitimacy (mafia), legitimacy without power (charity), etc.

**Example/Story:**
- Customer with defective product: LEGITIMACY (bought the product), URGENCY (if safety issue), POWER (if influential or legal threat)
- Random person on street asking for money: URGENCY (might genuinely need help), but no POWER or LEGITIMACY with your business

**Check Understanding:**
- "A major shareholder demands immediate meeting about strategy. Which attributes do they have? [Power: yes, Legitimacy: yes, Urgency: if they say it's urgent]"

**Transition:**
- "These attributes create seven stakeholder types"

---

<!-- Slide 11: Seven Stakeholder Types -->
## Mitchell's Stakeholder Typology
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

| Type | Attributes | Priority | Example |
|------|------------|----------|---------|
| **Definitive** | Power + Legitimacy + Urgency | HIGH | Regulator enforcing safety deadline |
| **Dominant** | Power + Legitimacy | Moderate | Major shareholder |
| **Dangerous** | Power + Urgency | Moderate | Activist group threatening boycott |
| **Dependent** | Legitimacy + Urgency | Moderate | Employees affected by layoff |
| **Dormant** | Power only | Low | Wealthy former customer |
| **Discretionary** | Legitimacy only | Low | Local charity seeking donation |
| **Demanding** | Urgency only | Low | Individual complainant with no standing |

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Don't memorize this table—understand the logic: more attributes = higher priority"

**Key Points:**
- Definitive stakeholders (all 3) get immediate attention—you MUST respond
- Middle tier (2 attributes): important but not crisis-level
- Low salience (1 attribute): monitor but don't prioritize
- This is dynamic—stakeholders can move categories

**Example/Story:**
- Discretionary → Dependent: local charity (legitimacy only) becomes employees volunteering on company time (adds urgency)
- Dormant → Dangerous: former customer (power through wealth) becomes angry on social media (adds urgency)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Where would you classify: Vietnamese Ministry of Education accrediting your university program with decision due next month?" [Definitive: power to accredit, legitimacy as regulator, urgency from deadline]

**Transition:**
- "Let's see this model in action"

---

<!-- Slide 12: Case Study - Product Recall -->
## Case Study: Stakeholder Prioritization in Crisis
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Scenario:** Pharmaceutical company discovers contaminated batch

**Stakeholder Analysis:**

**Definitive (Immediate action):**
- Customers who purchased contaminated batch (P+L+U: safety risk)
- Health regulators (P+L+U: enforcement authority + public health urgency)

**Dominant (Important):**
- Shareholders (P+L: financial impact but not immediate crisis)
- Supply chain partners (P+L: contractual obligations)

**Dependent (Address but limited power):**
- Employees worried about job security (L+U: legitimate concern, time-sensitive, but can't force company action)

**Low salience (Monitor):**
- General public not affected (legitimacy as stakeholders but no power or urgency)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol crisis (1982) updated—how would you prioritize?"

**Key Points:**
- Customers first: they have legitimate claim (bought product), urgency (health risk), power (can sue/report to media)
- Regulators: have power to shut you down, legitimate role, urgent public health mandate
- Shareholders matter but not before safety—this is ethical prioritization
- Employees are dependent—legitimate concerns but can't force action like regulators can

**Example/Story:**
- J&J pulled all Tylenol from shelves (not just contaminated batch) → prioritized customer safety over shareholder cost → rebuilt trust
- Contrast: companies that prioritize shareholders over safety often face worse long-term damage

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why aren't shareholders definitive in this case?" [No urgency—financial impact is serious but not immediate life-or-death]

**Transition:**
- "Notice this isn't just theory—it's ethical decision-making under pressure. Now let's look at modern CEO perspectives"

---

<!-- Slide 13: McKinsey CEO Research -->
## How Top CEOs Approach Stakeholder Engagement
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

**58%** of CEOs view external affairs as top priority
**12%** feel successful at it
**30%** of CEO time spent with external stakeholders

*Source: McKinsey & Company, 2024*

**The gap:** Knowing it matters ≠ Doing it well

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "We're back to our opening stat—but now you understand why it's hard"

**Key Points:**
- External affairs = government, media, community, regulators (Freeman's external stakeholders)
- 30% of time = 12 hours/week for a CEO
- The gap exists because stakeholder management is systematic work, not intuition
- McKinsey studied Microsoft, Nissan, Adidas, US Bancorp CEOs to find what works

**Example/Story:**
- Richard Davis (US Bancorp CEO): "The Holy Grail is to have 12 people on a management team who are equal voices and equal storytellers"—he trained his whole team, not just himself

**Check Understanding:**
- "If 30% of CEO time is external stakeholders, what does that tell you about importance of this skill?"

**Transition:**
- "McKinsey identified a framework successful CEOs use"

<!-- CORE CONTENT: PART 3 - MESSAGE ADAPTATION -->

<!-- Slide 14: Part 3 Section Break -->
## PART 3: How to Adapt Your Message
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

From stakeholder identification to effective communication

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "We've identified stakeholders (Freeman) and prioritized them (Mitchell). Now: how do we actually communicate with different groups?"

**Key Points:**
- This is where theory becomes practice
- Same information, different audiences = different messages
- We'll look at two frameworks: McKinsey's EDGE (what to do) and Duarte's calibration (how to adapt content)

**Example/Story:**
- Announcing a company restructuring: shareholders want ROI numbers, employees want job security info, media wants the narrative—same event, three different messages

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why can't you send the same message to all stakeholders?" [Different needs, different priorities, different contexts]

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with McKinsey's EDGE framework"

---

<!-- Slide 15: McKinsey EDGE Framework -->
## EDGE Framework for Stakeholder Engagement
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**E - Expanded**
Embrace role as bridge between organization and external world

**D - Distinctive**
Become storyteller-in-chief with singular, compelling narrative

**G - Growth-oriented**
Empower team of ambassadors throughout organization

**E - Engaged**
Maintain consistent communication drumbeat across stakeholder groups

*Source: Epstein et al., McKinsey & Company, 2024*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "EDGE is how successful CEOs operationalize stakeholder engagement"

**Key Points:**
- Expanded = don't delegate external stakeholders; YOU own the relationships
- Distinctive = consistent story (we'll see the "Four W's" next slide)
- Growth-oriented = train others to communicate too (US Bancorp example)
- Engaged = regular cadence, not just crisis communication
- These aren't personality traits—they're learnable behaviors

**Example/Story:**
- Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida: focused on emotional connection with employees, not just information transfer → "Employees don't remember what you said or what you achieved, but they do remember how you made them feel"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which element of EDGE addresses the problem of CEOs feeling unsuccessful at stakeholder management?" [All of them, but especially G—empowering others to share the load]

**Transition:**
- "The 'Distinctive' element—being storyteller-in-chief—requires a narrative structure"

---

<!-- Slide 16: Four W's Narrative Structure -->
## McKinsey's Four W's for Stakeholder Communication
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**WHO**
Your personal leadership journey and aspirations

**WHY**
Organization's reason for existence and contribution

**WHAT**
Strategic agenda in simple, compelling terms

**WHEN**
Timing of communication rollout

**Application:** Consistent narrative adapted for each stakeholder group

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is your communication backbone—same story, tailored delivery"

**Key Points:**
- WHO = personal credibility (ethos in Aristotle's terms, which you'll see in Week 7)
- WHY = purpose beyond profit (Simon Sinek's "Start with Why")
- WHAT = clear strategy that stakeholders can understand and support
- WHEN = sequencing (employees before media, investors before public announcement)
- Adapt the EMPHASIS for each audience, not the core story

**Example/Story:**
- To investors: emphasize WHAT (strategic plan, returns)
- To employees: emphasize WHO (your leadership) and WHY (purpose)
- To media: emphasize WHY (societal contribution) and WHAT (newsworthy strategy)

**Check Understanding:**
- "If you're announcing a new sustainability initiative, how would you adapt the Four W's for shareholders vs. environmental groups?" [Shareholders: WHAT = cost savings, WHY = long-term value; Environmental groups: WHY = planetary impact, WHAT = specific commitments]

**Transition:**
- "Now let's get more tactical: how do you adjust the actual content of your communication?"

---

<!-- Slide 17: Duarte's Audience Calibration -->
## Duarte's Logos/Pathos Balance
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Logos (Analytical):**
Data, statistics, charts, logical arguments, research citations

**Pathos (Emotional):**
Stories, anecdotes, metaphors, evocative visuals, humor

**Key Principle:** Match your content mix to your audience's preferences

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Nancy Duarte (author of *Resonate*, works with Apple, Google, TED) updated Aristotle for modern business"

**Key Points:**
- Logos = left brain, analytical thinking
- Pathos = right brain, emotional resonance
- Every presentation needs BOTH, but the ratio varies by audience
- This is from MIT Sloan Management Review (August 2024)—very recent, very practical

**Example/Story:**
- Pitching budget to finance team: 80% logos (spreadsheets, ROI calculations), 20% pathos (brief success story)
- Pitching to marketing team: 40% logos (key metrics), 60% pathos (customer stories, brand vision)

**Check Understanding:**
- "What happens if you're too analytical with a creative audience?" [They disengage—charts bore them] "Too emotional with engineers?" [You lose credibility—they want data]

**Transition:**
- "Duarte gives us specific audience categories"

---

<!-- Slide 18: Audience Calibration Matrix -->
## Tailoring Content to Audience Type
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

| Audience Type | Preferred Content | Approach |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Analytical** (Engineers, finance, scientists) | Data-driven, logical arguments | Lead with evidence; use emotion sparingly and strategically |
| **Emotionally-driven** (Sales, creatives, marketers) | Stories, vision, inspiration | Lead with narrative; support with key data points |
| **Mixed** (Cross-functional teams, executives) | Balanced blend | Strategic mix: data for credibility, stories for engagement |

**Content Inventory Method:**
1. Categorize each slide/section as analytical or emotional
2. Determine target balance based on audience
3. Adjust content mix accordingly

*Source: Duarte, MIT Sloan Management Review, 2024*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is immediately practical—audit your next presentation using this matrix"

**Key Points:**
- Analytical audiences: they WANT 20 slides of charts (that's not boring to them)
- Emotionally-driven: reduce analytical content drastically
- Mixed/executives: you need both because they're evaluating logic AND vision
- Vietnamese context: engineering students often prefer analytical; business students may want more balance

**Example/Story:**
- Same sustainability initiative, two audiences:
  - Engineering team: carbon reduction calculations, efficiency metrics, technical specs
  - Marketing team: customer perception research, brand story, vision for eco-friendly future

**Check Understanding:**
- "You're presenting a new software tool to a team of 5 engineers and 2 HR managers. How would you calibrate?" [Lean analytical but include brief HR benefit story]

**Transition:**
- "Let's see how all these frameworks work together"

---

<!-- Slide 19: Integration Example -->
## Putting It All Together: Stakeholder Communication Plan
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

**Scenario:** You're launching an employee wellness program

**Step 1 - Identify (Freeman):**
Employees, HR, senior management, insurance provider, external wellness vendor

**Step 2 - Prioritize (Mitchell):**
- **Definitive:** Senior management (power + legitimacy + urgency for budget approval)
- **Dominant:** HR team (power + legitimacy to implement)
- **Dependent:** Employees (legitimacy + urgency for their health needs)

**Step 3 - Adapt Message (EDGE + Duarte):**
- **Senior management:** ROI data, cost-benefit analysis (80% logos)
- **HR team:** Implementation plan, timeline, resource needs (60% logos, 40% pathos)
- **Employees:** Health benefits stories, ease of use, testimonials (30% logos, 70% pathos)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is your Week 4 memo in miniature—watch how the frameworks stack"

**Key Points:**
- Freeman tells you who's in the room
- Mitchell tells you who to prioritize (senior management first because they control budget)
- EDGE gives you the narrative structure (same program, adapted story)
- Duarte tells you how to calibrate content for each audience
- Notice employees are "dependent"—high legitimacy and urgency, but low power. You still communicate with them, just differently.

**Example/Story:**
- If you pitch employees first and they get excited, but management says no to budget, you've created disappointment and distrust
- Sequence matters: get management buy-in (definitive stakeholder), get HR implementation plan (dominant), THEN announce to employees (dependent)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why would employees get 70% pathos content?" [They care about personal health impact, not ROI—stories resonate more than statistics for behavior change]

**Transition:**
- "Before we wrap up, one critical insight from Mitchell"

---

<!-- Slide 20: Stakeholder Salience is Dynamic -->
## Critical Insight: Stakeholder Status Changes
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**Stakeholder salience is dynamic and perception-based**

**Dormant → Dangerous:**
Former customer (power through wealth) becomes activist on social media (adds urgency)

**Discretionary → Dependent:**
Local charity (legitimacy) becomes employee volunteer program (adds urgency)

**Dependent → Definitive:**
Employees (legitimacy + urgency) unionize (adds power)

**Implication:** Continuously reassess stakeholder landscape

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The stakeholder map you create today might be wrong next month—that's normal"

**Key Points:**
- Mitchell explicitly says salience is "perception-based"—how managers SEE stakeholders
- Stakeholders can gain attributes (employees unionize → gain power)
- Stakeholders can lose attributes (urgent deadline passes → lose urgency)
- Context changes everything (economic crisis → regulators gain power)

**Example/Story:**
- COVID-19: employees suddenly became definitive stakeholders (health urgency + legitimacy + power through labor shortage)
- Social media: gave individuals power they didn't have before (can create viral criticism)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can you think of a stakeholder type that has gained power in the last 5 years due to technology?" [Online reviewers, social media influencers, activist groups using digital organizing]

**Transition:**
- "Let's bring everything together"

---

<!-- WRAP-UP SECTION: 5 SLIDES -->

<!-- Slide 21: Key Takeaways -->
## Key Takeaways
<!-- LAYOUT: standard -->

1. **Freeman's Stakeholder Theory:** Identify all groups who affect or are affected by your organization (breadth)

2. **Mitchell's Salience Model:** Prioritize using power-legitimacy-urgency attributes (focus)

3. **Message Adaptation:** Use McKinsey's EDGE and Duarte's calibration to tailor communication (execution)

4. **Dynamic Assessment:** Stakeholder salience changes—reassess regularly

5. **Ethical Foundation:** Stakeholder analysis isn't manipulation—it's respectful, strategic communication

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "If you remember five things from today, remember these"

**Key Points:**
- We moved from broad (who?) to focused (who matters most?) to tactical (how to communicate?)
- This isn't about spinning messages—it's about understanding and respecting different needs
- Mitchell's framework especially prevents you from ignoring low-power but high-legitimacy stakeholders (ethical dimension)

**Example/Story:**
- Companies that ignore "dependent" stakeholders (employees, communities) often face backlash when those stakeholders gain power
- Respectful communication builds trust before you need it

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which takeaway will be most useful in your Business Memo?" [Probably #2 and #3—identifying and adapting]

**Transition:**
- "Let's preview what's coming up"

---

<!-- Slide 22: Assessment Preview -->
## Your Week 4 Business Memo (10%)
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

**The Assignment:**
Write a professional memo to a specific audience, demonstrating stakeholder analysis and message adaptation

**What You'll Apply:**
- Freeman's stakeholder identification
- Mitchell's prioritization framework
- Audience needs analysis
- Message adaptation techniques

**Between Now and Week 4:**
- **Today's tutorial:** Practice stakeholder mapping with case study
- **Week 3 lecture:** Learn Pyramid Principle (writing structure)
- **Week 3 tutorial:** Draft memo sections
- **Week 4:** Submit final memo

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's make the connection to graded work explicit"

**Key Points:**
- The memo isn't just writing—it's strategic communication planning
- You'll need to demonstrate you've identified the right audience
- Show you understand their needs
- Adapt your message appropriately
- Week 3 adds the structure (how to organize the memo itself)

**Example/Story:**
- Common mistake: students write a generic memo that could go to anyone
- Strong memo: explicitly shows "I'm writing to the CFO because they have budget authority (power) and this decision needs to happen before Q4 (urgency)"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Any questions about the memo assignment before tutorial today?"

**Transition:**
- "Next week we're building on this foundation"

---

<!-- Slide 23: Next Week Preview -->
## Week 3: Structured Business Writing
<!-- LAYOUT: standard -->

**Topic:** The Pyramid Principle (Minto, 1987)

**Key Concepts:**
- Top-down communication structure
- SCQA framework (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)
- Executive summary format
- Clarity and concision

**How It Connects:**
- Week 2 = WHO to write to and WHAT they need
- Week 3 = HOW to structure the writing itself

**Preparation:**
Complete Week 2 tutorial activity—you'll build on stakeholder analysis

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "If today was about the audience, next week is about the message structure"

**Key Points:**
- Barbara Minto worked at McKinsey—developed this for consultants
- Pyramid Principle = start with conclusion, then support (opposite of school essays)
- SCQA = how to frame any business problem
- This is what makes your memo readable and persuasive

**Example/Story:**
- Traditional essay: Introduction → Background → Analysis → Conclusion
- Business writing: Conclusion → Key reasons → Supporting details
- Executives don't have time for suspense—give them the answer first

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why would business writing be different from academic writing?" [Time constraints, decision-making focus, action-oriented]

**Transition:**
- "Finally, some resources to go deeper"

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "We've covered a lot—let's recap the journey"

**Key Points:**
- You now have systematic frameworks for audience analysis
- This isn't intuition—it's strategic planning
- Tutorial today will make this concrete with practice
- Quiz tests your understanding of the frameworks (definitions, applications)

**Example/Story:**
- "When you're working on group projects, use Freeman's categories to make sure you haven't forgotten anyone. Use Mitchell's model when you have limited time to present—who do you pitch to first?"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Any questions before we move to tutorial?"

**Transition:**
- "See you in tutorial—bring questions if anything is unclear"
