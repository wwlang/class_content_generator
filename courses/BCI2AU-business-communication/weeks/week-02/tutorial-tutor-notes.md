# Week 2 Tutorial: Tutor Notes

**Topic:** Audience Analysis Workshop (Budget Request Scenario)
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Business Memo: Audience Analysis (Due Week 4, 10%) - DIRECT PREPARATION WEEK

---

## Session Timing

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Quick Review | 5 min | Lecture recap + success criteria explanation |
| Introduce Activity | 5 min | Present VietTech scenario, clarify deliverable structure |
| Student Work Time | 70 min | Individual audience analysis (circulate to provide coaching) |
| Class Feedback | 8 min | 4 students share (2 min each), peer questions |
| Before Next Class | 2 min | Quiz, prereading, save work reminder |

**Selection for feedback:** Mix of volunteers and tutor selection. Choose students showing different valid approaches to primary audience selection (CFO vs. CEO choices are both valid).

**If time short:** Reduce to 3 presenters at 90 seconds each. Prioritize students who demonstrate strong Mitchell classification reasoning.

---

## Learning Objectives for Tutorial

By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Apply Freeman's stakeholder theory to identify all stakeholders in a budget request scenario
2. Use Mitchell's power-legitimacy-urgency framework to prioritize stakeholders and identify primary audience
3. Conduct audience needs analysis showing understanding of decision-maker concerns
4. Connect frameworks from lecture to practical memo preparation

**Critical Success Factor:** Students must understand this is DIRECT preparation for Week 4 memo. The deliverable they produce today is the foundation for their graded assessment.

## Why This Scenario Aligns with Assessment

**Assessment Handbook Option B:** "Budget request to CFO at Vietnamese technology company with difficult financial quarter"

**Tutorial Scenario (VietTech):** Training budget request with challenging financial context

**Alignment:**
- Same scenario TYPE (budget request, difficult finances, need to justify ROI)
- Scaled deliverable (200-250 word analysis vs. 500-750 word memo)
- Same frameworks required (stakeholder mapping, audience analysis)
- Same rubric criteria (Audience Analysis 30%, Strategic Thinking 25%)

**Key Difference:** Tutorial focuses on ANALYSIS phase (who to write to, what they need). Week 4 memo requires WRITING the actual memo. This is intentional scaffolding.

---

## Valid Student Approaches

Students may select different primary audiences. Accept all valid approaches if reasoning is sound.

### Approach 1: CFO as Primary Audience (Most Common)

**Rationale:**
- **Power:** Budget approval authority, controls company spending
- **Legitimacy:** Fiduciary responsibility for financial health
- **Urgency:** Must approve before program implementation (Q3 target)
- **Classification:** Definitive (P+L+U)

**Audience Needs Analysis:**
- CFO needs: ROI justification, cost-benefit analysis, risk mitigation
- Concerns: Company revenue down 8%, scrutinizes non-essential spending
- Evidence to persuade: Industry data (200%+ ROI), retention improvement (78%→85%), competitor benchmarking
- Logos/pathos balance: 85% logos (CFO is analytical, finance-focused), 15% pathos (brief retention story)

**Why this works:** CFO has clearest budget authority, making them definitive stakeholder.

---

### Approach 2: CEO as Primary Audience (Also Valid)

**Rationale:**
- **Power:** Final decision authority, sets company priorities
- **Legitimacy:** Ultimate responsibility for company success
- **Urgency:** Q2 results create urgency for retention strategies
- **Classification:** Definitive (P+L+U)

**Audience Needs Analysis:**
- CEO needs: Strategic rationale, talent retention impact, competitive positioning
- Concerns: Cost-conscious but values employee development (balanced priorities)
- Evidence to persuade: Retention improvement, competitor investments (FPT, TMA), leadership pipeline needs
- Logos/pathos balance: 70% logos, 30% pathos (CEO considers both financial and strategic/people factors)

**Why this works:** CEO may delegate budget decisions to CFO but has final authority. Valid to address CEO with CFO as secondary stakeholder.

---

### Approach 3: Joint Audience (CEO + CFO)

**Rationale:**
Some students may recognize the decision involves BOTH stakeholders:
- CFO controls budget mechanics
- CEO sets strategic priorities

**Audience Needs Analysis:**
- Must address both analytical concerns (CFO) and strategic vision (CEO)
- Primary paragraph targets CFO (budget holder), secondary addresses CEO (strategic value)
- Logos/pathos balance: 80% logos (satisfy CFO requirements), 20% pathos (strategic framing for CEO)

**Why this works:** Realistic recognition that major budget decisions involve multiple approvers. If student explains they'll write to CFO with CEO as secondary audience, this shows sophisticated understanding.

---

### Approach 4: CEO as Primary with CFO as Influential (Strategic)

**Rationale:**
- CEO is definitive (P+L+U) - decision authority
- CFO is dominant (P+L) - advisory influence but CEO decides
- Student writes to CEO knowing CFO will advise

**Audience Needs Analysis:**
- Address CEO's strategic concerns first (talent retention, competitive positioning)
- Pre-empt CFO objections by including ROI data
- Logos/pathos balance: 75% logos, 25% pathos (CEO has broader perspective than pure finance)

**Why this works:** In some organizations, CEO makes strategic people investments despite CFO concerns. If student explains this dynamic, accept it.

## Common Student Errors & Corrections

### Error 1: Selecting HR Director as Primary Audience

**What you'll see:** "HR Director is primary audience because they support the proposal"

**Problem:** HR Director lacks budget authority (scenario states "lacks budget authority"). Mitchell's POWER attribute is missing.

**Correction:** "HR Director is an important stakeholder (legitimacy + urgency) but not your primary audience for a budget request. Who has POWER to approve spending?"

**Coaching question:** "Look at Mitchell's three attributes. The HR Director supports you (legitimacy), and the program is needed soon (urgency), but can they APPROVE the $15,000 budget?"

---

### Error 2: Listing Stakeholders Without Freeman's Framework

**What you'll see:** "Stakeholders: CEO, CFO, HR Director"

**Problem:** Too narrow. Missing external stakeholders, employees, training vendors, etc.

**Correction:** "You've identified decision-makers, but Freeman says to include ALL groups who affect or are affected by the decision. Who else is impacted?"

**Coaching question:** "Think about Freeman's categories: employees (internal), suppliers (training vendors), even competitors (who benefit if you DON'T train your managers). Who else should be on this list?"

**Expected comprehensive list:**
- Internal: CEO, CFO, HR Director, mid-level managers (program participants), other employees (not included in program), Board of Directors
- External: Training vendors, competitors (talent poaching if no development), industry analysts (benchmarking)

---

### Error 3: Assigning All Three Attributes to Everyone

**What you'll see:** "CFO is definitive (P+L+U), CEO is definitive (P+L+U), HR Director is definitive (P+L+U)"

**Problem:** Mitchell's model is about DIFFERENTIATION. Not everyone can be highest priority.

**Correction:** "Mitchell's framework helps you prioritize when you can't address everyone equally. If CFO, CEO, and HR Director are all definitive, who do you write to first?"

**Coaching question:** "You have one memo to write (Week 4 assignment). You can only address ONE primary audience. Use Mitchell to determine who has the most power, legitimacy, AND urgency for THIS specific decision."

---

### Error 4: Generic Audience Needs

**What you'll see:** "CFO needs to know about the training program"

**Problem:** Too vague. Doesn't show understanding of CFO's specific concerns in context of difficult Q2 results.

**Correction:** "Be specific about WHAT the CFO needs to know. Given the scenario context (revenue down 8%), what's the CFO's biggest concern?"

**Coaching question:** "The scenario says the company had 'difficult Q2 financial results.' What would a CFO worry about when receiving a $15,000 budget request in this context?"

**Expected specificity:**
- CFO needs: ROI justification showing the $15,000 will generate value exceeding cost
- CFO concerns: Is this essential given revenue decline? Will it worsen financial position?
- Evidence to persuade: Retention improvement saves recruitment costs ($8,000-$12,000 per hire), 200%+ ROI industry data, competitors investing despite difficult market

---

### Error 5: Incorrect Logos/Pathos Balance

**What you'll see:** "CFO needs 50% logos, 50% pathos"

**Problem:** CFO is analytical, finance-focused role. Pathos should be minimal.

**Correction:** "Look at Duarte's audience calibration matrix (Lecture Slide 18). How does she classify finance/analytical audiences?"

**Coaching question:** "If you're writing to a CFO about a budget request, what kind of evidence will they find most persuasive—data and ROI calculations (logos) or stories about employee development (pathos)?"

**Expected balance:**
- CFO: 85-90% logos, 10-15% pathos
- CEO: 70-80% logos, 20-30% pathos (broader strategic perspective)
- HR Director: 60% logos, 40% pathos (people-focused but still professional)

## Facilitation Guidance

### During Work Time (70 minutes)

**First 20 minutes: Stakeholder Identification**
- Circulate to check students are listing stakeholders BROADLY using Freeman's categories
- Common issue: students list only 3-4 obvious stakeholders (CEO, CFO, HR Director)
- Prompt: "You've identified decision-makers. Who else is AFFECTED by this decision? Who are the 20 managers who'd participate? What about training vendors?"
- Goal: Students should have 7-10 stakeholder groups listed

**Minutes 20-45: Mitchell Prioritization**
- Focus on students struggling with power/legitimacy/urgency distinctions
- Use Socratic questions: "Can the HR Director FORCE the CEO to approve the budget? If not, they lack power. What attributes DO they have?"
- Watch for students assigning all three attributes to everyone—this defeats the purpose
- Goal: Students should classify 3-5 stakeholders and identify 1 primary audience

**Minutes 45-70: Audience Needs Analysis**
- Check students are being SPECIFIC about primary audience needs
- Generic needs ("CFO needs to know about the program") get pushback
- Ask: "What EXACTLY does the CFO need to know? What's their biggest concern given Q2 revenue decline?"
- Goal: Students write 75-100 words showing deep understanding of primary audience

**Timing check at 50 minutes:** Students should be starting Section 3 (Audience Needs Analysis). If most are still on Section 2, announce: "You should be starting Section 3 now. Prioritization is important but don't over-analyze—pick your primary audience and move forward."

---

### Class Feedback Facilitation (8 minutes)

**Select 4 students representing different approaches:**
1. Student who selected CFO as primary
2. Student who selected CEO as primary
3. Student with strong logos/pathos reasoning
4. Student with comprehensive stakeholder identification

**Question sequence for each presenter (2 min):**
1. "Who is your primary audience and why?" (30 sec)
2. "What's one specific need this audience has?" (30 sec)
3. "What evidence will persuade them?" (30 sec)
4. Peer question (30 sec)

**Facilitation notes:**
- After first 2 presenters, highlight: "Notice both CFO and CEO are valid choices—what matters is your REASONING using Mitchell's attributes"
- If student selected wrong audience (e.g., HR Director without power), use as teaching moment: "Can you identify which of Mitchell's three attributes is missing here?"
- Affirm good reasoning even when approach differs from yours

---

## Vietnamese Cultural Considerations

### Hierarchical Communication

**Cultural norm:** Vietnamese business culture respects hierarchy. Students may assume they should ALWAYS write to the highest authority (CEO) regardless of functional responsibility.

**Teaching approach:** Acknowledge cultural norm while introducing Western business practice:
- "In many Vietnamese companies, you would address the CEO out of respect for hierarchy"
- "In international business and modern Vietnamese companies, you often write to the person with FUNCTIONAL authority—the budget holder"
- "Your Week 4 memo can address either CEO or CFO as long as your Mitchell analysis supports it"

**Implication for tutorial:** Accept both CEO and CFO as valid primary audiences. Do NOT penalize students for choosing CEO if they justify it properly.

---

### Face-Saving and Direct Requests

**Cultural norm:** Direct budget requests can be seen as forward or demanding in Vietnamese culture. Students may soften language excessively.

**Teaching approach:**
- "In professional business writing, directness is valued. Your memo should clearly state: 'I am requesting $15,000 approval for...'"
- "This isn't disrespectful—it's efficient. Decision-makers prefer knowing exactly what you want"
- "You can be direct AND respectful: use professional tone, acknowledge concerns, provide evidence"

**Watch for:** Students writing vague requests like "I hope the company might consider possibly supporting..." Push for clarity: "What SPECIFICALLY are you asking for?"

---

### Collective vs. Individual Framing

**Cultural consideration:** Vietnamese students may frame benefits collectively ("good for company") rather than strategically ("competitive advantage").

**Teaching approach:** Both are valid, but help students be SPECIFIC:
- Generic: "Training is good for company"
- Specific: "Retention improved 7% saving ~$80,000 in recruitment costs"
- Strategic: "Competitors FPT and TMA invest in leadership development. Not investing risks talent loss to competitors."

---

## Sample Strong Student Response

### Section 1: Stakeholder Identification (68 words)

"VietTech's training budget decision affects multiple stakeholders: **Internal** - CEO (final authority), CFO (budget approval), HR Director (program advocate), 20 mid-level managers (participants), 130 other employees (not included, potential morale impact), Board of Directors (financial oversight). **External** - Training vendors (business opportunity), competitors like FPT Software and TMA Solutions (benefit if VietTech doesn't develop talent), potential recruits (company reputation as developer of people)."

---

### Section 2: Stakeholder Prioritization (92 words)

"Top 3 stakeholders:

**1. CFO (Definitive: P+L+U)** - **Power:** Budget approval authority. **Legitimacy:** Fiduciary responsibility for financial health. **Urgency:** Q3 implementation requires immediate approval.

**2. CEO (Definitive: P+L+U)** - **Power:** Final decision authority. **Legitimacy:** Responsible for strategic talent decisions. **Urgency:** Q2 results create urgency for retention strategies.

**3. HR Director (Dependent: L+U)** - **Legitimacy:** Program management responsibility. **Urgency:** Needs approval to proceed. **Power:** None (scenario states 'lacks budget authority').

**Primary audience: CFO** (direct budget authority, must approve spending)."

---

### Section 3: Primary Audience Needs Analysis (98 words)

"CFO needs ROI justification given Q2 revenue decline. **Primary concern:** Is $15,000 justified when revenue down 8%? **Evidence to persuade:** (1) Retention improvement 78%→85% saves ~$64,000 in recruitment costs (8 avoided hires × $8,000/hire), making $15,000 investment a 4:1 return; (2) Industry data: 200%+ ROI within 18 months; (3) Competitor benchmark: FPT and TMA investing despite market conditions. **Logos/pathos balance:** 85% logos (CFO is analytical—lead with financial data), 15% pathos (brief retention story). **Communication approach:** Formal memo with clear financial projections, BLUF structure (recommendation first)."

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Comprehensive stakeholder identification using Freeman's categories
- ✅ Accurate Mitchell classification with explicit P/L/U justification
- ✅ Clear primary audience selection with reasoning
- ✅ Specific audience needs tied to scenario context (Q2 revenue decline)
- ✅ Quantified evidence (retention savings calculation)
- ✅ Appropriate logos/pathos balance for CFO audience
- ✅ Professional business writing (specific, evidence-based, clear)

## Questions Students May Ask

**Q: "Can I write to both CEO and CFO in my Week 4 memo?"**

A: Your memo should have ONE primary addressee (in the "To:" line). You can mention "I've also shared this with [secondary stakeholder]" in the memo body if needed. But for clarity, choose ONE primary audience using Mitchell's framework. (Most likely: CFO as primary for budget request, with CEO as secondary stakeholder who may be consulted.)

---

**Q: "What if the CFO and CEO disagree—who wins?"**

A: Good question showing you understand organizational dynamics. CEO has ultimate authority (power), but CFO has expertise (legitimacy) and may influence the CEO's decision. For a budget request, CFO is still your primary audience because they control spending. If CEO overrides CFO, that's rare and usually for strategic reasons you'd need to justify in your memo.

---

**Q: "Is 200-250 words enough for this analysis?"**

A: Yes, this is intentionally scaled down from your Week 4 memo (500-750 words). Think of today's deliverable as your PLANNING document—the analysis that informs your memo writing. Week 4, you'll expand this into a full memo with context, evidence, and recommendations.

---

**Q: "Should I include the 20 mid-level managers as stakeholders?"**

A: Absolutely. Freeman says include anyone "affected by" the decision. The 20 managers are directly affected (they're the participants). They're likely "dependent" stakeholders (legitimacy + urgency but little power over budget approval). You don't write your memo TO them, but you should identify them in Section 1.

---

**Q: "What if I choose the wrong primary audience?"**

A: There's no single "wrong" answer if you justify your choice using Mitchell's framework. Both CEO and CFO are defensible. What matters for your grade (Week 4 memo) is that you clearly explain WHY you chose your primary audience and that your memo content matches that audience's needs. Weak choice: HR Director (no power). Strong choices: CEO or CFO (both definitive).

---

**Q: "Is this scenario realistic for Vietnam?"**

A: Yes. Vietnamese tech companies (VNG, FPT Software, TMA Solutions, Viettel) invest in leadership development programs. The challenge of justifying training budgets during difficult financial periods is universal. The $15,000 budget is realistic for a 20-person leadership program (approximately $750 per participant for curriculum, facilitators, materials).

---

**Q: "Can I propose a DIFFERENT primary audience, like the Board of Directors?"**

A: You can propose any audience if you justify it with Mitchell's framework. Board of Directors might have power and legitimacy, but do they have URGENCY for this decision? Typically, boards delegate operational budgets to CEO/CFO and focus on strategic oversight. If you argue the board is definitive, explain why they'd be involved in a $15,000 decision (usually below board approval threshold unless company is very small).

## Connection to Week 4 Assessment

### How Tutorial Prepares for Memo

**Tutorial deliverable (Week 2):** 200-250 word audience analysis
**Assessment deliverable (Week 4):** 500-750 word memo

**Tutorial = Planning Phase**
- Identify stakeholders → Know who you're writing to
- Prioritize using Mitchell → Choose primary audience
- Analyze audience needs → Know what to include in memo

**Week 4 = Writing Phase**
- Use audience analysis to structure memo
- Include evidence identified in needs analysis
- Apply Pyramid Principle (Week 3) to organize content
- Write full memo addressing primary audience

**Portfolio value:** Students who save today's deliverable have a 250-word analysis they can directly reference when writing Week 4 memo. This is intentional scaffolding.
