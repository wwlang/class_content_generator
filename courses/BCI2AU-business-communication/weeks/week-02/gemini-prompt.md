**Part 3:** Message Adaptation (Mapping & Duarte's Calibration) – 25 minutes

</slide>

<slide number="6" layout="section-break" title="Part 1 Introduction">

## Part 1: Stakeholder Identification

**The Foundation Question:** Who actually matters in business communication?

</slide>

<slide number="7" title="Freeman's Revolutionary Insight">

## The Traditional View Was Too Narrow

**Before Freeman (1984):**
- Organizations existed primarily to serve shareholders
- Other groups were secondary considerations
- Communication focused on investors and customers

**Freeman's Challenge:**
- Organizations exist within webs of relationships
- Success requires managing ALL stakeholder groups
- Strategic communication must address diverse audiences

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke Model">

## Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke Stakeholder Model

**Definition:** Organization at center, stakeholder groups radiating outward

**11 Original Categories (non-exhaustive):**

**Internal:**
- Employees
- Shareholders
- Management

**External:**
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Financiers
- Government/Regulators
- Political groups
- Trade associations
- Competitors
- Media
- Communities

</slide>

<slide number="9" title="Freeman's Core Definition">

## The Foundational Definition

> "A stakeholder in an organization is **any group or individual who can affect or is affected by** the achievement of the organization's objectives."
>
> – R. Edward Freeman (1984)

**Two-way relationship:**
- Groups who can **affect** the organization (influence, power, resources)
- Groups who are **affected by** the organization (impacted by decisions)

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Stakeholder Management Framework">

## Freeman's Three-Process Framework

**1. Environmental Scanning**
- Identify all stakeholder groups systematically
- Consider both obvious and non-obvious groups
- Map relationships and interdependencies

**2. Stakeholder Analysis**
- Understand each group's interests and influence
- Assess what each group needs or wants
- Identify potential conflicts between groups

**3. Strategic Planning**
- Incorporate stakeholder concerns into decisions
- Develop communication strategies for each group
- Balance competing interests ethically

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Freeman Example - Factory Expansion">

## Example: Manufacturing Company Expansion

**Scenario:** A Vietnamese manufacturing company plans to open a new factory

**Stakeholder Identification (Freeman's Model):**

| Internal | External |
|----------|----------|
| Current employees (job opportunities) | Local community (jobs, pollution concerns) |
| Shareholders (capital investment) | Environmental groups (impact assessment) |
| Management (execution responsibility) | Government (permits, regulations) |
| | Suppliers (new contracts) |
| | Customers (supply chain stability) |

**Key Insight:** Decision affects 9+ distinct stakeholder groups with different interests

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Why Freeman Matters for Communication">

## Communication Implications

**Each stakeholder group needs:**
- Different information emphasis
- Different communication channels
- Different timing and frequency
- Different tone and style

**Example: Factory Expansion Announcements**

| Stakeholder | Primary Message | Channel | Timing |
|-------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Employees | Career opportunities, job security | Town hall, email | First (before public) |
| Community | Jobs created, environmental safety | Public meeting, media | Second (after employees) |
| Investors | ROI, strategic rationale | Earnings call, report | Third (after internal) |
| Regulators | Compliance, impact mitigation | Formal submission | Throughout (legal requirement) |

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="section-break" title="Part 2 Introduction">

## Part 2: Stakeholder Prioritization

**The Resource Question:** When you can't address everyone equally, who comes first?

</slide>

<slide number="14" title="The Prioritization Challenge">

## Why Prioritization Matters

**The Reality:**
- Limited communication resources (time, budget, personnel)
- Competing stakeholder demands
- Urgent situations requiring triage
- Different stakeholders need different attention levels

**The Question Mitchell Answered:**
- "Who and what really counts?"
- Which stakeholders deserve attention **first**?
- How do we systematically prioritize without bias?

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="Mitchell's Salience Model">

## Mitchell's Stakeholder Salience Framework

**Three Attributes Determine Priority:**

**1. Power**
- Extent a party can impose its will in a relationship
- Sources: authority, resources, access to information
- Example: Regulator can shut down operations

**2. Legitimacy**
- Socially accepted and expected structures or behaviors
- Based on norms, laws, or moral claims
- Example: Employees have legitimate claim to safe working conditions

**3. Urgency**
- Time sensitivity or criticality of stakeholder claims
- Degree to which delay is unacceptable
- Example: Product recall requires immediate customer communication

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Power Types">

## Sources of Stakeholder Power

**Coercive Power** – Ability to impose sanctions or harm
- Regulators enforcing fines
- Unions threatening strikes
- Activists organizing boycotts

**Utilitarian Power** – Control over resources organization needs
- Major customers providing revenue
- Suppliers controlling critical inputs
- Investors providing capital

**Normative Power** – Influence through symbolic or prestige means
- Media shaping public narrative
- Industry associations setting standards
- Academic institutions conferring legitimacy

</slide>

<slide number="17" title="Legitimacy Types">

## Sources of Stakeholder Legitimacy

**Individual Legitimacy** – Personal stake or rights
- Property owners affected by development
- Consumers of recalled products
- Employees impacted by restructuring

**Organizational Legitimacy** – Formal relationship or contract
- Shareholders owning equity
- Suppliers under contract
- Customers with warranties

**Societal Legitimacy** – Socially recognized claims
- Environmental groups protecting public goods
- NGOs advocating for vulnerable populations
- Community groups preserving local interests

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Urgency Types">

## Sources of Stakeholder Urgency

**Time-Critical** – Deadline-driven claims
- Regulatory compliance deadlines
- Contract expiration dates
- Fiscal reporting periods

**Criticality** – Importance regardless of timing
- Safety hazards requiring immediate action
- Threats to organizational survival
- Irreversible decisions

**Combined** – Both time-sensitive AND critical
- Product recall affecting consumer safety (immediate harm + deadline)
- Financial crisis threatening bankruptcy (survival + time pressure)
- Environmental disaster requiring emergency response (safety + urgency)

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="Seven Stakeholder Types">

## Mitchell's Seven-Part Typology

| Classification | Attributes | Priority Level | Example |
|----------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| **Dormant** | Power only | Low | Wealthy former customer |
| **Discretionary** | Legitimacy only | Low | Local charity seeking donation |
| **Demanding** | Urgency only | Low | Lone protestor without legitimacy |
| **Dominant** | Power + Legitimacy | Moderate | Major shareholder |
| **Dangerous** | Power + Urgency | Moderate | Activist group threatening action |
| **Dependent** | Legitimacy + Urgency | Moderate | Employees affected by urgent issue |
| **Definitive** | All three | **High** | Regulator enforcing compliance deadline |

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Dynamic Stakeholder Status">

## Critical Insight: Salience Changes

**Stakeholder status is:**
- **Dynamic** – can increase or decrease over time
- **Perception-based** – depends on managerial awareness
- **Context-dependent** – varies by situation

**Examples of Status Changes:**

- Employees gain urgency during labor disputes (Dependent → Definitive)
- Media gains power during crisis (Discretionary → Dangerous)
- Customers lose urgency after product launch (Definitive → Dominant)
- Communities gain legitimacy through organizing (Demanding → Dependent)

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="Mitchell Example - Product Recall">

## Example: Product Recall Scenario

**Situation:** A Vietnamese electronics company discovers 5% of products have battery defects

**Stakeholder Salience Analysis:**

| Stakeholder | Power | Legitimacy | Urgency | Classification | Priority |
|-------------|-------|------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Customers | High | High | High | **Definitive** | **Immediate** |
| Regulators | High | High | High | **Definitive** | **Immediate** |
| Media | High | Low | Moderate | Dangerous | High |
| Suppliers | Moderate | High | Low | Dominant | Moderate |
| Investors | High | High | Low | Dominant | Moderate |

**Communication priority:** Customers and regulators first (safety + compliance)

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="Applying Mitchell - Communication Sequence">

## Product Recall Communication Sequence

**Phase 1: Definitive Stakeholders (First 24 hours)**
1. **Customers** – Direct communication, return instructions, safety guidance
2. **Regulators** – Formal notification, compliance plan, timeline

**Phase 2: Dangerous/Dominant Stakeholders (24-48 hours)**
3. **Media** – Press release, spokesperson availability, transparency commitment
4. **Employees** – Internal briefing, customer service protocols, Q&A

**Phase 3: Lower Salience (48-72 hours)**
5. **Investors** – Impact assessment, financial implications, mitigation strategy
6. **Suppliers** – Quality review process, contract implications
7. **Retailers** – Inventory management, point-of-sale messaging

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="section-break" title="Part 3 Introduction">

## Part 3: Message Adaptation

**The Execution Question:** How do I actually communicate differently with different audiences?

</slide>

<slide number="24" title="McKinsey EDGE Framework">

## EDGE Framework for Stakeholder Engagement

**E**xpanded – Embrace role as bridge between organization and external world

**D**istinctive – Become storyteller-in-chief with singular, compelling narrative

**G**rowth-oriented – Empower team of ambassadors throughout organization

**E**ngaged – Maintain consistent communication drumbeat across stakeholder groups

**Source:** McKinsey & Company (2024) – CEO research with Microsoft, Nissan, Adidas, US Bancorp leaders

</slide>

<slide number="25" title="Four W's Narrative Framework">

## Four W's: Building Your Core Narrative

**WHO** – Your personal leadership journey and aspirations

**WHY** – Organization's reason for existence and contribution to society

**WHAT** – Strategic agenda in simple, compelling terms

**WHEN** – Timing of communication rollout and milestones

**Application:** Develop this narrative once, adapt for different stakeholders

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="framework" title="Stakeholder Mapping Matrix">

## Stakeholder Mapping Matrix

| **Internal Stakeholders** | **External Stakeholders** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| C-suite executives | Shareholders/investors |
| Employees | Media |
| Board of directors | Local community |
| Business unit leaders | Government/regulators |
| | Suppliers |
| | Customers |

**Use:** Ensure comprehensive coverage - no stakeholder group overlooked

</slide>

<slide number="27" title="Duarte Audience Calibration">

## Nancy Duarte's Audience Calibration Framework

**Context:** Nancy Duarte – leading presentation expert (author of *Resonate*, clients include Apple, Google, TED)

**Core Principle:** Match content type to audience preferences

**Aristotelian Appeals Updated for Business:**

- **Logos** (Logical): Data, statistics, reasoned arguments
- **Pathos** (Emotional): Stories, metaphors, imagination-stirring content
- **Ethos** (Credibility): Character, trustworthiness, expertise

**The Calibration Question:** What ratio of logos to pathos does this audience need?

</slide>

<slide number="28" title="Audience Calibration Matrix">

## Calibrating Content for Audience Types

| Audience Type | Characteristics | Recommended Approach |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Analytical** | Engineers, scientists, finance, data analysts | Lead with data; use emotional appeal "lightly and with intention" |
| **Emotionally-driven** | Sales teams, creatives, marketers, HR | Reduce analytical content; "they likely won't want 20 slides with charts" |
| **Mixed** | Cross-functional teams, executive committees, general audiences | Blend both approaches strategically; lead with logos, support with pathos |

**Process:**
1. Research your specific audience before presenting
2. Audit existing content (logos vs. pathos inventory)
3. Adjust ratio to match audience preferences

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Content Types">

## Analytical vs. Emotional Content Types

**Analytical Content (Logos):**
- Statistical data and quantified results
- Charts, graphs, diagrams
- Expert quotations and research citations
- Logical argument structures
- Technical demonstrations
- Appendices with supporting data

**Emotional Content (Pathos):**
- Anecdotes and personal stories
- Metaphors and analogies
- Evocative photographs or videos
- Humor (when appropriate)
- Benefits framing ("imagine when...")
- Suspenseful reveals or dramatic structure

</slide>

<slide number="30" title="Calibration Examples">

## Audience Calibration in Practice

**Scenario:** Proposing sustainability initiative to different audiences

**To Engineering Team (Analytical):**
- "Solar panels reduce energy costs 23% annually"
- "Payback period: 4.2 years based on current utility rates"
- Technical specifications and efficiency calculations
- ROI model with sensitivity analysis

**To Marketing Team (Emotional):**
- "Imagine telling customers we're 100% renewable"
- "This positions us as environmental leaders in our industry"
- Competitor sustainability commitments and brand reputation
- Customer sentiment data on environmental values

**To Executive Committee (Mixed):**
- "Solar investment pays back in 4.2 years (logos) AND positions our brand as sustainability leader (pathos)"
- Financial model (logos) + competitive differentiation story (pathos)
- Risk analysis (logos) + stakeholder impact narrative (pathos)

</slide>

<slide number="31" title="Channel Selection">

## Matching Communication Channels to Stakeholders

**High-Stakes, High-Complexity Messages:**
- Face-to-face meetings, video calls
- Allows real-time dialogue, clarification, nuance
- Best for: Regulators, major investors, senior executives

**Moderate-Stakes, Moderate-Complexity:**
- Email with attachments, formal letters, presentations
- Provides documentation, allows considered response
- Best for: Employees, suppliers, business partners

**Lower-Stakes, Broad Reach:**
- Press releases, social media, website updates
- Maximizes reach, maintains transparency
- Best for: General public, media, customers

**Principle:** Match channel richness to message complexity and stakeholder priority

</slide>

<slide number="32" title="Integration Example">

## Putting It All Together: Communication Strategy Development

**Step 1:** Identify stakeholders (Freeman's Hub-and-Spoke)

**Step 2:** Prioritize by salience (Mitchell's Power-Legitimacy-Urgency)

**Step 3:** Map stakeholders (Internal/External Matrix)

**Step 4:** Develop core narrative (Four W's)

**Step 5:** Adapt content for each audience (Duarte's Calibration)

**Step 6:** Select appropriate channels (Richness matching)

**Result:** Systematic, evidence-based stakeholder communication

</slide>

<slide number="33" title="Common Pitfalls">

## Common Stakeholder Communication Failures

**1. One-Size-Fits-All Messaging**
- Same content, tone, channel for all audiences
- Ignores different information needs and preferences
- Example: Technical jargon in customer-facing communication

**2. Stakeholder Blindness**
- Failing to identify non-obvious but important stakeholders
- Surprise resistance from overlooked groups
- Example: Community opposition to expansion (no early consultation)

**3. Priority Misalignment**
- Addressing low-salience stakeholders before high-salience
- Violates trust when critical groups learn second-hand
- Example: Media announcement before employee notification

**4. Static Assessment**
- Treating stakeholder salience as fixed
- Missing shifts in power, legitimacy, or urgency
- Example: Activist group gains media attention (Demanding → Dangerous)

</slide>

<slide number="34" title="Cultural Considerations">

## Stakeholder Communication in Vietnamese Context

**Power Distance Implications:**
- Government stakeholders carry heightened power and legitimacy
- Hierarchical communication protocols matter
- Face-to-face channels for senior stakeholders preferred

**Collective Orientation:**
- Community and family stakeholder groups have high legitimacy
- Group harmony affects stakeholder priorities
- Indirect communication styles for conflict-sensitive topics

**Relationship-Based Business:**
- Stakeholder relationships built over time, not transactional
- Personal connections affect power dynamics
- Trust-building precedes substantive communication

**Practical Adjustments:**
- Add government relations to high-salience stakeholders
- Consider family stakeholders in SME contexts
- Budget extra time for relationship cultivation before asks

</slide>
