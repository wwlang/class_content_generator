## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Freeman's Stakeholder Theory:** Any group or individual who can affect or is affected by organizational objectives. Identifies stakeholder categories including employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, communities, government, and media.

- **Mitchell's Salience Model:** Prioritize stakeholders using three attributes:
  - **Power** = ability to impose will (economic leverage, legal authority, voting rights)
  - **Legitimacy** = socially accepted claim (contractual rights, moral standing)
  - **Urgency** = time sensitivity (deadline-driven, safety-critical, crisis situations)
  - Creates seven stakeholder types: Definitive (all 3), Dominant/Dangerous/Dependent (2 attributes), Dormant/Discretionary/Demanding (1 attribute)

- **Munter Strategic Communication Framework:** Communicator strategy (objectives, style), audience strategy (who, needs, benefits), message strategy (content, organization, emphasis), channel choice, and culture context.

- **Duarte's Audience Calibration:** Match logos (analytical, data-driven) vs. pathos (emotional, narrative) content to audience preferences.

**What good work looks like:**
- Complete stakeholder identification showing awareness of multiple audience groups
- Accurate audience needs analysis showing different priorities for different stakeholders
- Strategic message adaptation demonstrating understanding of Mitchell's power-legitimacy-urgency
- Professional business writing with specific, evidence-based reasoning

## Main Activity: Budget Request Audience Analysis

**Assessment Connection:** Business Memo: Audience Analysis (Due Week 4) - This activity directly practices stakeholder mapping and audience needs analysis for a budget request scenario, similar to Assessment Handbook Option B.

**The Scenario:**

You are the Training & Development Manager at VietTech Solutions, a Vietnamese technology company with 150 employees in Ho Chi Minh City. You need to request approval for a $15,000 annual budget to implement a leadership development program for 20 high-potential mid-level managers.

**Context:**
- Company had difficult Q2 financial results (revenue down 8% vs. last year)
- Your department's employee retention rate improved from 78% to 85% over past year
- Industry data shows leadership training ROI of 200%+ within 18 months
- Competitors (FPT Software, TMA Solutions) have invested heavily in leadership programs
- CEO is cost-conscious but values employee development
- CFO scrutinizes all non-essential spending
- HR Director supports the proposal but lacks budget authority

**The Task:**

Conduct a comprehensive audience analysis to prepare for writing a budget request memo. You will identify all stakeholders, prioritize them using Mitchell's framework, and analyze the specific needs of your primary audience.

**Deliverable:**

A 200-250 word **Audience Analysis Brief** structured as follows:

**Section 1: Stakeholder Identification (50-75 words)**
- List all relevant stakeholders affected by or affecting this budget decision
- Briefly note how each stakeholder relates to the decision

**Section 2: Stakeholder Prioritization (75-100 words)**
- Classify your top 3 stakeholders using Mitchell's model (Power, Legitimacy, Urgency)
- Identify your PRIMARY audience (the decision-maker you'll write the memo to)
- Justify why this stakeholder is primary using Mitchell's attributes

**Section 3: Primary Audience Needs Analysis (75-100 words)**
- What does your primary audience need to know?
- What concerns or objections will they have?
- What evidence will persuade them? (logos/pathos balance)
- What communication approach suits their role and priorities?

**Success Criteria:** (from Written Communication Rubric)
- **Audience Analysis (30%):** Accurate stakeholder identification using Freeman's categories; clear needs analysis showing understanding of primary audience's concerns and priorities; specific evidence of what will persuade this audience
- **Strategic Thinking (25%):** Effective application of Mitchell's power-legitimacy-urgency framework to prioritize stakeholders; demonstration of Munter Framework (communicator strategy, audience strategy); appropriate logos/pathos calibration for business audience

**Resources:**

- **Lecture Frameworks:**
  - Freeman's stakeholder categories (Slide 7)
  - Mitchell's power-legitimacy-urgency model (Slides 10-11)
  - Munter Strategic Communication Framework (referenced in lecture)
  - Duarte's logos/pathos calibration matrix (Slide 18)

- **Assessment Handbook Reference:**
  - Section 1: Business Memo requirements (especially audience analysis criteria)
  - Option B scenario structure (this activity mirrors that format)

**Class Feedback:**

At the end of the session, 4-6 students will share their audience analysis. Be prepared to:
- Identify your primary audience and justify using Mitchell's three attributes
- Explain one specific audience need you identified and how you'd address it
- Defend your logos/pathos balance recommendation for this audience

**Work approach:** Individual work. This is YOUR analysis for YOUR portfolio preparation.

⚠️ **Participation:** You must have a complete 200-250 word deliverable to share. This activity directly prepares you for the Week 4 Business Memo. Incomplete work affects your participation grade (10% of course total).
