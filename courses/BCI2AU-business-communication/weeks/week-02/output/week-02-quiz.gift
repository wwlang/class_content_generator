::Freeman Stakeholder Model::According to Freeman's definition, what two capacities does a stakeholder possess in relation to an organization?{
=Can affect or be affected by the organization's objectives #Correct! Freeman's definition establishes the two-way relationship\: stakeholders both influence and are impacted by organizational decisions.
~Own shares or receive compensation from the organization #Incorrect. This describes only financial stakeholders. Freeman's definition is much broader.
~Make strategic decisions or vote on policy matters #Incorrect. Freeman includes stakeholders without decision-making power, like employees and communities.
~Communicate with management or provide feedback #Incorrect. Communication is a method, not Freeman's defining characteristic of stakeholder relationships.
####Freeman's stakeholder theory redefines businesses as webs of relationships, not just profit engines. A stakeholder can <b>affect</b> (influence, impact) the organization through power or voice, OR <b>be affected by</b> (impacted, influenced) organizational decisions. This <b>bidirectional</b> (two-way) relationship is fundamental. Examples\: investors affect companies (power), while communities are affected by operations (impact). See Week 2 slides 6-7.}

::Freeman Stakeholder Model::How do Freeman's internal stakeholders differ from external stakeholders?{
=Internal stakeholders are part of the organization; external stakeholders are outside but connected to it #Correct! This captures Freeman's core distinction\: internal (employees, management, shareholders) vs. external (customers, suppliers, government, communities).
~Internal stakeholders have more power; external stakeholders have more legitimacy #Incorrect. The internal/external distinction is about location and relationship, not power distribution.
~Internal stakeholders must be consulted; external stakeholders are optional #Incorrect. Freeman says both groups matter equally to organizational strategy.
~Internal stakeholders focus on profit; external stakeholders focus on ethics #Incorrect. Freeman includes diverse motivations across both groups.
####Freeman's hub-and-spoke model organizes stakeholders by <b>proximity</b> (closeness or distance) to the organization. <b>Internal stakeholders</b> (employees, management, shareholders) are part of organizational structures. <b>External stakeholders</b> (customers, suppliers, government, media, communities, competitors) exist outside but have relationships with the organization. Both matter for <b>strategic</b> (business-focused) and <b>ethical</b> (moral) planning. See Week 2 slides 7-8.}

::Freeman Stakeholder Model::Why does Freeman's theory argue that ignoring stakeholder groups creates business risk?{
=Because ignored stakeholders can harm the organization through strikes, boycotts, or regulatory action #Correct! Freeman demonstrates that ignoring any stakeholder group (workforce, communities, regulators) leads to costly consequences.
~Because it violates moral principles and makes leadership feel guilty #Incorrect. While ethics matter, Freeman's argument is primarily business-focused.
~Because customers will always demand better products than competitors offer #Incorrect. This is about competition, not Freeman's stakeholder theory.
~Because shareholders will reduce dividends if the company ignores other groups #Incorrect. Freeman's argument extends beyond financial returns.
####Freeman's insight is <b>strategic</b> (business-focused, not just ethical). Real-world costs include\: employee strikes (ignored workforce), product boycotts (ignored communities), regulatory penalties (ignored government), and <b>reputational</b> (relating to public opinion and trust) damage (ignored media). Examples\: Boeing 737 MAX crashes (ignored safety regulators) \= 346 deaths and $20 billion losses; Rana Plaza factory collapse (ignored workers) \= 1,100+ deaths and brand devastation. <b>Stakeholder consideration</b> (thinking about affected groups) is business necessity. See Week 2 slide 8.}

::Mitchell Stakeholder Salience::What are the three attributes that determine a stakeholder's salience (priority) in Mitchell's framework?{
=Power, legitimacy, and urgency #Correct! These three independent attributes combine to rank stakeholders. The more attributes a stakeholder has, the higher their salience.
~Profit, legitimacy, and urgency #Incorrect. Mitchell uses Power, not profit. Power means the ability to impose will.
~Power, influence, and time-sensitivity #Incorrect. The three attributes are power, legitimacy (not influence), and urgency.
~Authority, morality, and deadline #Incorrect. Use Mitchell's exact terms\: power, legitimacy, urgency.
####Mitchell's framework <b>operationalizes</b> (makes actionable) Freeman by ranking stakeholders using three <b>independent</b> (separate, can exist alone) attributes. <b>Power</b> \= ability to impose will (regulatory authority, economic leverage). <b>Legitimacy</b> \= <b>socially accepted</b>, expected claims (contracts, legal standing, moral rights). <b>Urgency</b> \= time-critical, needs immediate attention (deadlines, crises). A stakeholder with all three is "definitive" (highest priority); fewer attributes \= lower salience. See Week 2 slides 10.}

::Mitchell Stakeholder Salience::How can a stakeholder move from "Dormant" to "Dangerous" category according to Mitchell's model?{
=By gaining urgency in addition to existing power—no longer dormant, now dangerous #Correct! Dormant stakeholders have only power. When urgency is added (e.g., angry customer goes viral on social media), they become Dangerous (power + urgency).
~By losing legitimacy while retaining power #Incorrect. A stakeholder losing legitimacy doesn't increase priority. Gaining urgency increases priority.
~By involving themselves in organizational decision-making #Incorrect. Mitchell's categories depend on power/legitimacy/urgency attributes, not involvement level.
~By hiring lawyers and threatening legal action #Incorrect. Legal action might add legitimacy or urgency, but the mechanism is the attributes, not the tactic.
####Mitchell emphasizes that stakeholder <b>salience is dynamic</b> (changes over time) and <b>perception-based</b> (how managers see stakeholders). Stakeholders can move between categories as attributes change. <b>Dormant</b> (power only) → <b>Dangerous</b> (power + urgency) when deadlines or crises emerge. <b>Discretionary</b> (legitimacy only) → <b>Dependent</b> (legitimacy + urgency) when employees volunteer and their needs become time-sensitive. COVID-19 shifted employees to definitive status (health urgency + legitimacy + labor power). Organizations must <b>reassess</b> (review and evaluate again) stakeholder landscape <b>continuously</b>. See Week 2 slide 20.}

::Mitchell Stakeholder Salience::Why are "Definitive" stakeholders treated as highest priority in Mitchell's typology, while "Demanding" stakeholders receive lowest priority?{
=Definitive stakeholders have all three attributes (power, legitimacy, urgency); Demanding have only urgency—justifying different priority levels #Correct! More attributes \= stronger claim on organizational attention. Definitive can enforce compliance; Demanding cannot.
~Definitive stakeholders are always customers; Demanding are always low-wage workers #Incorrect. Both categories can include various stakeholder types. Priority depends on attributes, not role.
~Definitive stakeholders are more ethical; Demanding stakeholders are less ethical #Incorrect. Mitchell's model is about strategic priority, not ethics. A demanding stakeholder can have legitimate concerns.
~Definitive stakeholders have existed longer in the organization than Demanding stakeholders #Incorrect. Historical tenure doesn't determine salience. Attributes do.
####Mitchell's typology is <b>algorithmic</b> (follows a clear, logical sequence based on attribute count). <b>Definitive</b> stakeholders (power + legitimacy + urgency) must receive immediate action—you have no choice (regulators enforcing deadlines, customers with safety claims). <b>Demanding</b> stakeholders (urgency only) have time-critical needs but no power to force compliance and no <b>legitimate</b> (widely accepted and expected) standing—monitor but don't prioritize. Example\: A complaining stranger with no standing \= Demanding. A safety regulator \= Definitive. See Week 2 slides 11-12.}

::EDGE Model (Stakeholder Engagement)::What do the four letters in the EDGE framework stand for?{
=Expanded, Distinctive, Growth-oriented, Engaged #Correct! EDGE is McKinsey's framework for how successful CEOs operationalize stakeholder engagement.
~External, Delegated, Growth-focused, Engagement #Incorrect. The second letter is Distinctive, not Delegated. EDGE involves personal ownership, not delegation.
~Expanded, Dynamic, Growth-oriented, Effective #Incorrect. The second and fourth letters are Distinctive and Engaged.
~Excellence, Dialogue, Genuine, Empathy #Incorrect. These are not the EDGE acronym terms from McKinsey's framework.
####McKinsey's <b>EDGE framework</b> describes CEO-level stakeholder management. Each element is <b>learnable</b>, not personality-based. <b>Expanded</b> \= you own external relationships, don't delegate. <b>Distinctive</b> \= develop one compelling narrative, consistent across audiences. <b>Growth-oriented</b> \= train ambassadors throughout organization so others communicate too. <b>Engaged</b> \= maintain regular communication rhythm, not just crisis response. See Week 2 slide 15.}

::EDGE Model (Stakeholder Engagement)::How does the "Distinctive" element of EDGE address the communication challenge that most CEOs face?{
=By requiring one compelling narrative adapted for different audiences, rather than fragmented or inconsistent messaging #Correct! The gap between knowing stakeholders matter (58% of CEOs) and succeeding (12%) often comes from inconsistent communication. Distinctive provides the narrative backbone.
~By training every employee to become a communication expert #Incorrect. Training others is the 'Growth-oriented' element, not Distinctive.
~By increasing the CEO's personal visibility at all stakeholder events #Incorrect. Frequency isn't the problem; story consistency is. That's Distinctive.
~By using different languages when communicating with international stakeholders #Incorrect. Distinctive refers to narrative consistency, not language choice.
####The "Distinctive" element requires you to become <b>storyteller-in-chief</b>—develop one <b>singular</b> (unique, one only) <b>compelling narrative</b> about who you are (WHO), your organization's purpose (WHY), and the strategic agenda (WHAT). Then <b>adapt emphasis</b> for each stakeholder group without changing the core story. This <b>consistency</b> builds trust and prevents the fragmented messaging that makes CEOs feel unsuccessful despite effort. Richard Davis (US Bancorp) trained his whole team as equal storytellers, multiplying reach while keeping narrative aligned. See Week 2 slides 15-16.}

::EDGE Model (Stakeholder Engagement)::Why does the EDGE framework include "Growth-oriented" (empowering ambassadors) rather than requiring only the CEO to handle stakeholder communication?{
=Because one person cannot maintain consistent communication across all stakeholders; trained ambassadors multiply reach while preserving narrative #Correct! Growth-oriented distributes the communication load while keeping the story aligned. It solves the bottleneck of CEO-only communication.
~Because employees naturally understand stakeholder needs better than CEOs #Incorrect. The reason is capacity and scalability, not employee expertise.
~Because it reduces CEO workload so they can focus on financial performance #Incorrect. The goal isn't to reduce CEO time on stakeholders; it's to increase total organizational communication capacity.
~Because external audiences prefer hearing from multiple voices rather than just the CEO #Incorrect. While multi-voice can be good, the primary reason is enabling scalability of a consistent narrative.
####The <b>Growth-oriented</b> element recognizes that stakeholder engagement cannot be a one-person job. Training others to communicate—while keeping the narrative <b>aligned</b> (consistent with) the core story—multiplies your reach without creating fragmentation. US Bancorp CEO Richard Davis said\: "The Holy Grail is to have 12 people on a management team who are equal voices and equal storytellers." This is <b>distributive</b> (spreading across many) communication—scaling stakeholder engagement beyond the CEO. See Week 2 slide 15.}

::Duarte's Audience Calibration::In Duarte's framework, what do "Logos" and "Pathos" represent as communication approaches?{
=Logos \= analytical/data-driven; Pathos \= emotional/story-driven #Correct! These are Duarte's two content types. Logos appeals to logic; Pathos appeals to emotion and values.
~Logos \= visual presentations; Pathos \= written documents #Incorrect. These aren't format distinctions. Both Logos and Pathos can appear in any format.
~Logos \= long presentations; Pathos \= brief presentations #Incorrect. Length isn't the distinction. It's analytical vs. emotional content.
~Logos \= formal tone; Pathos \= casual tone #Incorrect. Tone and formality are separate from the logic/emotion distinction.
####Nancy Duarte updated Aristotle's <b>persuasive</b> (convincing, compelling) appeals for modern business. <b>Logos</b> (logical appeals) \= data, statistics, research citations, structured arguments that appeal to analytical thinking. <b>Pathos</b> (emotional appeals) \= stories, anecdotes, metaphors, visuals, humor that appeal to values and feelings. Every presentation needs both, but the <b>ratio</b> (proportion, relationship between parts) varies by audience type. This is from MIT Sloan Management Review (2024). See Week 2 slide 17.}

::Duarte's Audience Calibration::How should content mix differ when presenting to analytical audiences versus emotionally-driven audiences according to Duarte?{
=Analytical audiences prefer high Logos (data/logic); emotionally-driven audiences prefer high Pathos (stories/vision) #Correct! Duarte's core insight is matching content ratio to audience preference. Engineers want charts; marketers want narratives.
~Both audience types need identical content ratios; only presentation style should differ #Incorrect. Duarte explicitly argues that content mix should vary by audience type.
~Analytical audiences only want data; emotionally-driven audiences only want stories #Incorrect. Both need both types, just in different proportions.
~Emotional audiences are harder to persuade, so they require more time investment #Incorrect. Difficulty isn't the distinction. Preference for content type is.
####Duarte's <b>calibration matrix</b> guides content adjustment for three audience types. <b>Analytical</b> (engineers, finance, scientists)\: lead with evidence—80% Logos, 20% Pathos. <b>Emotionally-driven</b> (sales, creatives, marketers)\: lead with narrative—30% Logos, 70% Pathos. <b>Mixed</b> (cross-functional teams, executives)\: <b>balanced</b>—50% Logos, 50% Pathos for credibility AND engagement. <b>Mismatch</b> (wrong content for audience) creates problems\: too much data bores creatives; too much emotion loses engineers. See Week 2 slide 18.}

::Duarte's Audience Calibration::Why does Duarte argue that using the same content mix for all audiences is ineffective communication?{
=Because different audiences process information differently—analytical minds need data, creative minds need narrative engagement #Correct! Audiences have different preferences based on cognitive style. Matching content to preference increases effectiveness.
~Because some audiences are more intelligent than others #Incorrect. Duarte's argument isn't about intelligence but about thinking style and preferences.
~Because audiences from different industries always disagree on priorities #Incorrect. Disagreement on content isn't Duarte's point; preference for how information is delivered is.
~Because presenting to large groups requires different techniques than small groups #Incorrect. Group size isn't Duarte's distinction. Audience cognitive preference is.
####Duarte's insight is <b>cognitive</b> (related to thinking and how minds process information). Some minds are <b>analytically wired</b> (naturally suited to logic and data)—they trust data, logic, evidence before emotional appeal. Others are <b>emotionally wired</b> (naturally suited to narrative and values)—they connect through vision, stories, values before accepting numbers. Using 80% data with creatives \= disengagement. Using 80% stories with engineers \= lost credibility. <b>Calibration</b> (matching content to audience) means adjusting ratio to match how your specific audience prefers to learn and decide. This is <b>neuroscience-informed</b> (based on how brains work) business communication. See Week 2 slides 17-18.}
