$CATEGORY: Week 2

::Freeman's Stakeholder Definition::According to Freeman's 1984 stakeholder theory, what defines a stakeholder in an organization?{
~Any group or individual who has invested money in the organization #This describes only investors or financiers, which is too narrow. Freeman's definition includes both those who affect AND those who are affected by the organization, not just financial stakeholders.
=Any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives #Freeman defined stakeholders as "any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives." This bidirectional definition includes both those who have power over the organization and those who are impacted by it.
~Any group or individual who holds shares in the organization #This describes only shareholders, which is the pre-Freeman view of stakeholder management. Freeman expanded the concept to include employees, customers, communities, suppliers, and many other groups.
~Any group or individual who works directly for the organization #This describes only employees, which is too narrow. Freeman's stakeholder theory includes external groups such as customers, suppliers, government, media, communities, and competitors.
}

::Freeman's Stakeholder Categories::Which of the following is NOT one of Freeman's 11 stakeholder categories from his original 1984 hub-and-spoke model?{
~Competitors #Competitors ARE one of Freeman's stakeholder categories. While they may seem like adversaries, they affect your strategic decisions and competitive positioning.
~Trade associations #Trade associations ARE one of Freeman's 11 original stakeholder categories. They represent industry interests and can influence regulatory and business environments.
=Social media influencers #Social media influencers were not part of Freeman's 1984 framework because social media didn't exist then. The lecture notes that modern organizations might add this category, but it's not part of Freeman's original 11 categories.
~Media #Media IS one of Freeman's stakeholder categories. Media shapes public perception and can significantly affect organizational reputation and success.

::Mitchell's Three Attributes::What are the three attributes in Mitchell's Stakeholder Salience Model that determine stakeholder prioritization?{
~Importance, Influence, and Interest #While these sound plausible, Mitchell's model specifically uses Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency. These three attributes combine to determine stakeholder salience (prominence).
=Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency #Mitchell's framework uses exactly these three attributes\: Power (extent stakeholder can impose their will), Legitimacy (socially accepted claim), and Urgency (time sensitivity and criticality). Stakeholder salience is determined by how many of these attributes are present.
~Authority, Credibility, and Timeliness #These are not Mitchell's terms. The model uses Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency as the defining attributes of stakeholder salience.
~Impact, Rights, and Criticality #While these terms relate to stakeholder characteristics, Mitchell's model specifically identifies Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency as the three key attributes.
}

::Mitchell's Definitive Stakeholders::In Mitchell's Stakeholder Salience Model, what are "definitive" stakeholders?{
~Stakeholders who have only power #Stakeholders with only power are classified as "dormant" in Mitchell's model. They have low salience because they lack legitimacy and urgency.
~Stakeholders who have power and legitimacy #Stakeholders with power and legitimacy are classified as "dominant" in Mitchell's model. They are important but not at the highest priority level without urgency.
=Stakeholders who have power, legitimacy, and urgency #Definitive stakeholders possess all three attributes—power, legitimacy, and urgency—making them the highest priority. They demand immediate attention and action from the organization.
~Stakeholders who have legitimacy and urgency but not power #Stakeholders with legitimacy and urgency but not power are classified as "dependent" in Mitchell's model. They have important claims but limited ability to force organizational action.
}

::Stakeholder Type Matching::Match each Mitchell stakeholder type to its correct attribute combination\:{
=Dormant stakeholders -> Power only (no Legitimacy or Urgency)
=Discretionary stakeholders -> Legitimacy only (no Power or Urgency)
=Demanding stakeholders -> Urgency only (no Power or Legitimacy)
=Dependent stakeholders -> Legitimacy + Urgency (no Power)
}

::Purpose of Stakeholder Salience::Why is Mitchell's concept of stakeholder salience important for managers?{
~It helps managers avoid dealing with difficult stakeholders #The purpose is not to avoid stakeholders but to prioritize them strategically. Even low-salience stakeholders should be monitored because their status can change.
=It provides a systematic way to allocate limited attention and resources among competing stakeholder claims #Managers face limited time, money, and attention with multiple competing stakeholder claims. Mitchell's salience model provides a systematic algorithm for prioritization based on power, legitimacy, and urgency—making stakeholder management actionable rather than aspirational.
~It eliminates the need to consider all stakeholders equally #While the model does help prioritize (rather than treating all equally), this misses the key purpose\: strategic resource allocation when you cannot address everyone at once.
~It ensures that only powerful stakeholders receive attention #This is both inaccurate and unethical. Definitive stakeholders have all three attributes (including legitimacy and urgency), not just power. Mitchell's model ensures legitimate claims receive attention even when stakeholders lack power.
}

::Dynamic Stakeholder Salience::Stakeholder salience is static—once you classify a stakeholder type, it remains constant over time.{
FALSE#Mitchell explicitly states that stakeholder salience is dynamic and perception-based. Stakeholders can gain or lose attributes over time. Examples from the lecture\: employees who unionize move from "dependent" to "definitive" by gaining power; a former customer who becomes an activist on social media moves from "dormant" to "dangerous" by adding urgency. The lecture emphasizes that managers must continuously reassess the stakeholder landscape because context changes everything (e.g., COVID-19 suddenly made employees definitive stakeholders due to health urgency).
TRUE#Review Slide 20 on dynamic stakeholder status. The lecture provided examples of stakeholders moving between categories as their attributes change. Context matters—economic shifts, crises, or social movements can alter power, legitimacy, or urgency.
}

::McKinsey EDGE Framework Element::What is the primary purpose of the "D" (Distinctive) element in McKinsey's EDGE framework for stakeholder engagement?{
~To create different messages for each stakeholder group #While you do adapt messages for different audiences (that's message adaptation), "Distinctive" refers to having ONE core narrative that you adapt, not creating entirely different messages. The Four W's (Who, Why, What, When) provide this consistent backbone.
=To become the storyteller-in-chief with a singular, compelling narrative #The "Distinctive" element means becoming storyteller-in-chief with a singular, compelling narrative. You maintain one consistent story (the Four W's framework) but adapt the EMPHASIS for each audience. This ensures coherence while allowing for stakeholder-specific communication.
~To distinguish between important and unimportant stakeholders #That's what Mitchell's salience model does (prioritizing stakeholders). The EDGE framework is about HOW to engage stakeholders effectively, not which ones to prioritize.
~To differentiate your organization from competitors #While competitive differentiation may be part of your narrative, "Distinctive" in EDGE specifically refers to having a clear, consistent story that makes you an effective communicator, not market positioning.

::Duarte's Content Balance::According to Duarte's audience calibration framework, analytical audiences (engineers, finance professionals) should receive presentations that are 100% data-driven with no emotional content.{
FALSE#While analytical audiences do prefer data-driven content (typically 80% logos), they still need SOME emotional content (20% pathos). The lecture emphasizes that every presentation needs BOTH logos and pathos—the ratio varies by audience, but neither should be completely eliminated. For analytical audiences, you lead with evidence and use emotion sparingly and strategically (e.g., a brief success story to illustrate the impact of the data). Going 100% analytical risks losing even engineers' engagement because humans need some narrative connection.
TRUE#Review Slide 18 on Duarte's audience calibration matrix. Even technical audiences benefit from strategic emotional content to maintain engagement and provide context for data. The key is the ratio, not elimination.
}

::Message Adaptation Reasoning::In the wellness program integration example from the lecture, why do employees receive 70% pathos content while senior management receives 80% logos content?{
~Because employees are less educated and can't understand data #This is both inaccurate and disrespectful. The difference isn't about intelligence or education—it's about what each audience needs to make their specific decision. Employees are perfectly capable of understanding data; they simply need different information to decide whether to participate.
~Because management doesn't care about employee wellness stories #Management may care about wellness stories, but their PRIMARY decision criterion is financial (budget approval requires ROI justification). The content mix reflects decision-making needs, not level of care.
=Because employees need to connect with personal health impact to change behavior, while management needs ROI data to approve budget #This demonstrates strategic message adaptation\: employees are being asked to change personal behavior (participate in wellness activities), so they need to connect emotionally with how it benefits their health—stories and testimonials are persuasive for behavior change. Management holds budget authority and must justify costs to shareholders—they need cost-benefit analysis and ROI projections. Same program, different decision contexts, different content calibration.
~Because emotional content is easier to create than analytical content #The choice of logos/pathos ratio isn't about ease of creation—it's about audience needs and decision-making context. In fact, creating compelling emotional content can be just as difficult as analytical content.
