# Week 8 Tutorial: Tutor Notes

**Topic:** Executive Presence Practice - Hot Seat Q&A
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12) - Q&A Performance (15% of presentation grade)

---

## Session Timing

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Quick Review | 5 min | Lecture recap + success criteria from Presentation Rubric |
| Activity Setup & Group Formation | 5 min | Form groups of 5-6, explain hot seat structure, assign roles |
| Hot Seat Rounds | 60 min | Each student: 2 min presentation + 3 min Q&A (5 students × 5 min = 25 min per group; tutor circulates) |
| Written Reflection | 15 min | Individual writing time with guiding prompts |
| Class Feedback | 10 min | 4-6 students share insights (2 min each) |

**Total:** 95 minutes scheduled (allows 5 min buffer)

**If time is short:**
- Reduce hot seat to 4 students per group (saves ~5 min per group)
- Reduce written reflection to 10 minutes (students can expand later)
- Reduce class feedback to 3 sharers at 90 seconds each (saves ~4 min)

**Selection for feedback:** Volunteer first, then random selection if needed. Emphasize that ALL students must be prepared to share (keeps engagement high).

## Learning Objectives for Tutorial

By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to:

1. **Demonstrate** executive presence (gravitas + communication) while presenting under pressure
2. **Apply** the Four-Step Q&A Framework (acknowledge, clarify, answer, check) to challenging questions
3. **Maintain** composure when faced with unexpected or difficult questions
4. **Evaluate** their own Q&A performance through specific, actionable written reflection

---

## Quick Review Facilitation (5 min)

**Delivery approach:**
- Ask students to recall the three elements of Executive Presence before revealing them (active retrieval)
- Poll: "Which is most important: Gravitas, Communication, or Appearance?" (Answer: Gravitas - 67% of what execs value)
- Emphasize connection to Week 12 Q&A: "Your presentation has a mandatory 10-minute Q&A worth 15% of the grade. Today you practice this exact skill."
- Highlight key stat: Sound of voice matters 2x as much as content (Hewlett, 2024)

**Common question:** "Will we be graded on today's practice?"
**Answer:** "No, today is practice only. Your participation grade depends on completing the activity and reflection, not on perfect performance. This is a safe space to make mistakes and learn. But what you practice today directly prepares you for the graded Week 12 Q&A."

---

## Activity Setup Facilitation (5 min)

### Group Formation (2 min)

**Optimal group size:** 5-6 students per group
- 5 students = 25 min of hot seat rounds (tight timing, good practice)
- 6 students = 30 min of hot seat rounds (more practice, may need to rush slightly)

**Formation method:**
- Count off by 5s or 6s depending on class size
- Mix groups—don't let existing project teams stay together (prevents comfort zone, builds new skills)
- Physically separate groups so they don't distract each other

### Role Assignment (2 min)

**Roles within each group:**
1. **Timekeeper:** Tracks 2-minute presentation and 3-minute Q&A; gives 30-second warnings
2. **Questioners (all others):** Prepare challenging questions; support presenter by asking thoughtful questions
3. **Hot Seat Presenter (rotates):** Each person takes a turn presenting + defending

**Instructions to give:**
1. "Each person will spend 5 minutes in the hot seat: 2-minute presentation on your Week 12 topic + 3-minute Q&A."
2. "Timekeeper: Give a 30-second warning for both presentation and Q&A. Be firm with time—this teaches time management."
3. "Questioners: Your job is to help your peers practice handling pressure. Challenging but respectful questions."
4. "Presenters: Use the Four-Step Q&A Framework. Don't worry about being perfect—practice is the goal."
5. "I'll circulate to observe and coach. Call me over if your group gets stuck."

### Order Determination (1 min)

**Methods:**
- Volunteer order: "Who wants to go first?" (often someone raises hand)
- Random: Draw numbers, alphabetical by first name, youngest to oldest
- Strategic: "If you're less prepared, go earlier—you'll learn from watching others"

**Tip:** Going first can be easier (less time to get nervous). Going last allows learning from others.

## Hot Seat Rounds Facilitation (60 min)

### Your Role as Tutor

**Primary responsibilities:**
- **Circulate** between groups, spending 5-7 minutes observing each
- **Listen** for use of Four-Step Framework language
- **Coach** in real-time when you observe issues
- **Model** good questions if groups are being too easy

### What to Listen For

**Positive indicators (reinforce these):**
- Presenter uses acknowledgment: "Great question," "I appreciate that"
- Presenter clarifies before answering: "Are you asking about X or Y?"
- Presenter answers directly in 20-30 seconds (not rambling)
- Presenter checks understanding: "Does that address your question?"
- Presenter maintains composure when challenged (no defensiveness)
- Questioners ask challenging but respectful questions
- Questioners give presenter space to think (not piling on)

**Warning signs (intervene):**
- Presenter becomes defensive: tone shifts, body language closes, "That's a stupid question"
- Presenter rambles: answers exceed 60 seconds, loses thread
- Presenter fakes knowledge: making up answers they don't know
- Questioners are hostile: attacking person, not testing knowledge
- Questioners are too easy: only softballs, no real pressure
- Silence/freezing: presenter unable to respond, visible panic

### Coaching Interventions

**If presenter is defensive:**
> "Pause. Take a breath. Assume they're testing your knowledge, not attacking you personally. Try starting with 'That's a great question' before you defend your position."

**If presenter is rambling:**
> "You've been answering for 60 seconds. Practice being more concise—answer the core question in 20-30 seconds, then check if they want more detail."

**If presenter fakes knowledge:**
> "It's better to say 'I don't know, but here's how I'd find out' than to make up an answer. Honesty builds credibility."

**If questioners are too easy:**
> "I'm hearing only clarification questions. Challenge them more. Try: 'Some experts argue the opposite—how do you respond?' or 'What data supports that conclusion?'"

**If questioners are hostile:**
> "Remember, you're helping them practice, not trying to stump them. Rephrase that question more constructively."

**If presenter freezes:**
> "It's okay to pause and think. Try: 'That's an excellent question—let me think about that for a moment.' Taking a visible breath is fine."

### Real-Time Modeling

**If groups aren't asking challenging questions, demonstrate:**
> "Let me model one. [To presenter] You mentioned X approach, but have you considered Y approach? What made you choose X over Y?"

**If groups aren't using frameworks, highlight when someone does:**
> "Great job—did everyone hear how [student] acknowledged the question before answering? That's Step 1 of the framework. Keep doing that."

## 3-5 Valid Student Approaches (Hot Seat Q&A)

Different students will handle the hot seat differently—all can demonstrate executive presence:

### Approach 1: The Acknowledger
**Style:** Focuses heavily on Step 1 (Acknowledge) with phrases like "Great question," "I'm glad you asked," "That's really insightful"
**Why it works:** Builds rapport, buys thinking time, shows respect, demonstrates gravitas through graciousness
**Coaching tip:** If ALL acknowledgment and no answer, prompt: "Great acknowledgment. Now make sure you answer the substance within 30 seconds."

### Approach 2: The Clarifier
**Style:** Uses Step 2 (Clarify) extensively: "Just to make sure I understand..." "Are you asking about X or Y?" "Can you rephrase that?"
**Why it works:** Prevents misunderstanding, demonstrates active listening, shows rigor, models "listen to learn" orientation
**Coaching tip:** If over-clarifying (seeking perfect understanding before answering), prompt: "Sometimes it's okay to answer and then adjust if needed. Trust your understanding."

### Approach 3: The Direct Answerer
**Style:** Jumps quickly to Step 3 (Answer): Gets to the point, provides evidence, confident delivery, minimal preamble
**Why it works:** Efficient, demonstrates subject mastery, respects questioner's time, projects confidence
**Coaching tip:** If too abrupt (sounds dismissive), prompt: "Try starting with acknowledgment—'Great question'—before diving into the answer. It softens the tone."

### Approach 4: The Evidence-Provider
**Style:** Answers with data, citations, examples: "According to [source]..." "Research shows..." "For example, in [case]..."
**Why it works:** Demonstrates deep knowledge, builds credibility, convinces skeptics, fulfills "demonstrates expert knowledge" criterion
**Coaching tip:** If over-citing (sounds academic, not conversational), prompt: "You can mention sources without full citations. 'Recent research shows...' is enough."

### Approach 5: The Honest Acknowledger
**Style:** Readily admits knowledge gaps: "I don't know, but here's how I'd find out" "That's outside my research scope, but..."
**Why it works:** Builds trust, demonstrates confidence (secure enough to admit limits), shows authenticity
**Coaching tip:** "Excellent honesty. Make sure you're not defaulting to 'I don't know' too quickly—you know more than you think."

**Key point for tutor:** All five approaches can earn high marks on Q&A Performance rubric (15%). Help students lean into their natural strengths while developing weaker areas.

## Written Reflection Facilitation (15 min)

### Setup

**Provide guiding prompts on board/slide:**
1. Q&A Performance: Which questions were hardest to handle? Why?
2. Framework Application: Which step of Four-Step Framework felt most natural? Which needs practice?
3. Executive Presence: How well did you maintain composure? What triggered defensiveness?
4. Improvement Plan: What specific skill will you practice before Week 12?

**Tutor tips:**
- Circulate to ensure students are writing (not checking phones)
- If students finish early (< 10 min): "Add more specific examples. Avoid vague observations like 'It was hard.' WHY was it hard? Give me the exact moment."
- Remind: "This reflection will guide your preparation for Week 12's graded Q&A. Be honest about what needs improvement."

**Common student question:** "How long should this be?"
**Answer:** "Minimum 150 words. Focus on specificity—one detailed example is better than three vague observations."

### What Good Reflections Look Like

**Good reflection characteristics:**
- Identifies specific questions that were challenging (not "all questions were hard")
- Names exact moments of struggle: "When [peer] asked about alternative approaches..."
- Connects struggle to framework gaps: "I skipped Step 1 (acknowledge) when defensive"
- States concrete improvement plan: "Before Week 12, I'll prepare responses to 10 potential challenging questions"

**Poor reflection characteristics:**
- Vague observations: "It was hard," "I learned a lot," "I need to improve"
- No specific examples or moments
- Generic improvement plans: "I'll practice more"
- Surface-level analysis: "I was nervous"

**If you see poor reflections at 5-minute mark:**
> "I'm seeing vague reflections. Give me SPECIFIC examples. Not 'I was nervous'—instead: 'When asked about my data sources, I forgot to acknowledge the question first and jumped straight to defending my work. Next time I'll say Great question before answering.'"

---

## Class Feedback Facilitation (10 min)

### Setup

**Ask for 4-6 volunteers to share one insight:**
- If fewer than 4 volunteer, give 10-second countdown: "I'll call on someone in 10 seconds if we don't have volunteers"
- Each student shares for ~2 minutes max

**Prompts for sharing:**
- "What's one challenging question you received and how did you handle it?"
- "What's one specific skill you'll improve before Week 12?"
- "What surprised you about being in the hot seat?"

### Facilitation Tips

**After each share:**
- Ask class: "Did anyone else experience something similar?" (builds community, normalizes struggles)
- If time allows, ask follow-up: "How specifically will you practice that skill?" (accountability)
- Thank each sharer: "That's a valuable insight—thanks for your honesty."

**Encourage specific sharing:**
> "Don't just say 'I need to improve Q&A.' Tell us which specific step of the framework you'll practice and how."

**Highlight diverse experiences:**
> "Notice how different students found different questions challenging? That's because your topics are different and your knowledge gaps are different. Preparation is personal."

## Common Misconceptions to Address

### Misconception 1: "I need to answer every question perfectly to get a good grade"
**Reality:** The rubric says "Handles all questions brilliantly; demonstrates expert knowledge; composed under pressure." "Brilliant" handling includes saying "I don't know, but here's how I'd find out." Honesty + composure = brilliance.

### Misconception 2: "If I say 'I don't know,' I'll lose marks"
**Reality:** Faking knowledge damages credibility more than admitting knowledge gaps. Saying "I don't know" with confidence (Step 3: Answer directly) demonstrates executive presence. Follow up with how you'd find the answer.

### Misconception 3: "Challenging questions mean the audience is hostile"
**Reality:** In academic settings, challenging questions signal engagement, not hostility. The Week 12 Q&A includes faculty and peers testing your thinking. Assume positive intent—they want to see you think critically.

### Misconception 4: "I should apologize when I don't know something"
**Reality:** Don't apologize ("Sorry, I don't know"). Instead, reframe with confidence: "That's outside the scope of my research, but here's a related insight..." or "I'd need to investigate that further, but here's my hypothesis..."

### Misconception 5: "Executive presence means being extroverted and charismatic"
**Reality:** Executive presence = gravitas (confidence + inclusiveness), communication (listening + clarity), authenticity. Introverts excel at listening and thoughtful responses. You don't need to be loud to have presence.

## Vietnamese Cultural Considerations

### Hierarchy and Questioning Authority

**Cultural context:** Vietnamese students may feel uncomfortable being questioned by peers or questioning authority figures
**Tutorial adaptation:**
- Emphasize that academic Q&A is a learning space where respectful challenge is expected and valued
- Frame challenging questions as helping, not attacking: "You're helping them practice for Week 12"
- Model respectful questioning language: "I'm curious about..." "Could you help me understand..."

**Language to use:**
> "In academic settings, asking challenging questions shows you're engaged and thinking critically, not being disrespectful. In Vietnamese culture, we value respect for speakers—you can show respect AND ask tough questions by using phrases like 'I'm curious about your reasoning on...'"

### Face-Saving and Defensiveness

**Cultural context:** Preserving "face" (dignity, reputation) is paramount; being challenged publicly can feel face-threatening
**Tutorial adaptation:**
- Reframe hot seat as skill-building, not evaluation: "This is practice, not judgment"
- Teach that acknowledging questions preserves face: "Great question" shows respect for questioner while defending your work
- Model recovering from mistakes: "I misspoke—let me clarify..." (shows mistakes don't destroy face)

**Language to use:**
> "Notice how 'Great question' preserves everyone's face. You're showing respect to the questioner while maintaining your expertise. Both people maintain dignity."

### Emotional Restraint

**Cultural context:** Vietnamese culture tends toward emotional restraint; showing discomfort or defensiveness may feel like losing control
**Tutorial adaptation:**
- Validate that feeling pressure is normal: "Everyone feels pressure in hot seat—even CEOs"
- Teach that pausing to think demonstrates composure, not weakness
- Frame "staying calm" as strategic, not emotional: "Pause = you're thinking strategically"

**Language to use:**
> "Executive presence isn't about hiding emotions—it's about managing them. Taking a visible breath before answering shows you're in control, not that you're struggling."

### Authority and Presentations

**Cultural context:** Presenting to faculty/authority figures creates anxiety due to hierarchical norms
**Tutorial adaptation:**
- Reframe Q&A as dialogue, not interrogation: "Questions = interest in your ideas"
- Teach that faculty asking tough questions = they take your work seriously
- Practice with peers first to build confidence before facing faculty

**Language to use:**
> "When a professor asks a challenging question in Week 12, they're showing they take your work seriously enough to engage deeply. 'Great question' acknowledges their expertise while defending your position."

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Students freeze or panic in hot seat
**Solution:**
- Coach them to use silence strategically: "It's okay to pause. Try: 'That's a great question—let me think about that for a moment.'"
- Model taking a visible breath before answering
- Normalize struggle: "Everyone freezes sometimes. Practice helps."

### Problem: Questioners only ask easy, clarifying questions (no real pressure)
**Solution:**
- Intervene with modeling: "Let me show you a challenging question: [To presenter] Some experts argue the opposite of your conclusion. How do you respond to that criticism?"
- Prompt questioners: "You're being too nice. Challenge their assumptions. Ask 'Why not [alternative approach]?'"
- Remind them: "You're helping them practice for Week 12 where faculty WILL ask tough questions"

### Problem: Questioners pile on when presenter struggles
**Solution:**
- Intervene immediately: "Give them space to recover. One question at a time."
- Redirect energy: "Great challenging question—now let's give [presenter] 30 seconds to think before the next one"
- Teach questioner etiquette: "If someone is struggling, don't pile on. Wait until they've recovered before asking next question."

### Problem: Presenter rambles for 90+ seconds per answer
**Solution:**
- Interrupt gently: "Pause there. You've been answering for 90 seconds. In Week 12, you'll have 10 minutes for multiple questions, so practice being concise. Answer the core question in 20-30 seconds."
- Teach checking: "After 20 seconds, check: 'Does that address your question, or would you like me to elaborate?'"

### Problem: Written reflections are vague ("I learned a lot")
**Solution:**
- Interrupt at 5-minute mark with examples: "I'm seeing vague reflections. Give me THIS: 'When [peer] asked about alternative approaches, I stumbled because I skipped Step 1. Next time I'll acknowledge before answering.' Not THIS: 'I need to improve.'"
- Provide sentence starters on board: "The hardest question was when...", "I struggled because...", "Before Week 12, I will..."

### Problem: Students finish hot seat rounds too quickly (some groups faster than others)
**Solution:**
- Add depth: "If you finish early, do a second round with different topics or practice answering follow-up questions"
- Provide extension activity: "Practice the Parking Lot technique—one person asks a complex question, presenter defers it appropriately"
- Use wait time productively: "Start your written reflection early while waiting for other groups"

## Key Phrases for Tutor to Use

**Encouraging practice:**
- "This is a safe space to make mistakes. Better to stumble here than in your graded Week 12 Q&A."
- "I'm seeing excellent use of the Four-Step Framework—keep it up."
- "Notice how different students handle Q&A differently? All approaches can demonstrate executive presence."

**Coaching technique:**
- "Pause. Take a breath. What framework applies here?"
- "You're being defensive. Assume positive intent and try again."
- "Great acknowledgment. Now answer the substance in 20-30 seconds."

**Building confidence:**
- "You handled that challenging question really well. What did you do differently?"
- "See how acknowledging the question changed the tone immediately? That's the power of Step 1."
- "Your reflection shows real insight. That self-awareness will help you prepare for Week 12."

**Connecting to assessment:**
- "This exact skill—handling Q&A under pressure—is worth 15% of your presentation grade in Week 12."
- "The rubric says 'Handles all questions brilliantly; composed under pressure.' You're building that skill right now."
- "Week 12 Q&A is 10 minutes. Today you're practicing the same skills in a shorter format."

## Assessment Connection Reminder

**Week 12 Group Presentation Rubric (from Assessment Handbook, Section 4):**

| Criteria | Weight | Excellent (94-100%) |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Q&A Performance** | **15%** | **Handles all questions brilliantly; demonstrates expert knowledge; composed under pressure** |
| Delivery & Presence | 25% | Commanding presence; engaging throughout; perfect voice and pace |
| Content & Analysis | 30% | Sophisticated framework application; compelling evidence |

**Today's tutorial directly prepares students for Q&A Performance (15%):**
- "Handles all questions brilliantly" = Four-Step Framework application (acknowledge, clarify, answer, check)
- "Demonstrates expert knowledge" = Confident answers with evidence; honest about knowledge gaps
- "Composed under pressure" = Executive presence (gravitas, communication); no defensiveness

**Tutor reminder:** Explicitly connect today's practice to graded rubric criteria throughout the session:
> "The rubric says 'composed under pressure.' When you pause to think before answering, you're demonstrating that composure. That's what gets you to Excellent level."
