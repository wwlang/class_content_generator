# SEGMENT 1

## Executive Presence: The Three Elements

*What leaders develop to perform under pressure*

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Executive Presence Definition">

## What Is Executive Presence?

**Executive Presence (EP):** The ability to project mature self-confidence, inspire others, and remain effective under pressure.

### The Updated Executive Presence Model (Hewlett, 2024)

**1. GRAVITAS** *(67% of senior executives say this is what really matters)*
- Confidence and decisiveness under pressure
- Inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives
- **Key shift:** Pedigree less important than demonstrated competence

**2. COMMUNICATION** *(Second most important element)*
- Superior speaking skills, commanding presence
- Virtual presence (Zoom comfort now essential)
- "Listen to learn" orientation vs. "listen to respond"

**3. APPEARANCE** *(Least important, most changed)*
- Authenticity now paramount over formality
- Digital presence matters (online image)
- Showing up in person signals commitment

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="content" title="Gravitas in Action">

## Gravitas: Confidence + Inclusiveness

### Case Study: The Listening Tour Strategy

**Context:** New CEO seeking to catalyze cultural change

**Action:** Asked every meeting: *"Tell me one thing you're experimenting with"*

**Result:** Employees shifted behavior to prepare better answers

**Lesson:** Questions can catalyze change as powerfully as directives

*(McKinsey, 2025)*

### Gravitas Tactics

- Show mastery through deep subject matter knowledge
- Demonstrate decisiveness in high-pressure moments
- Practice inclusiveness through authentic engagement with diverse perspectives

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Communication Element">

## Communication: Virtual + Listening

### Post-Pandemic Additions to Communication Element:

| Traditional Skill | New Essential Skill |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Command a room in person | Comfort on Zoom - virtual presence now mandatory |
| Superior speaking skills | "Listen to learn" orientation - active listening signals leadership |
| Assertive message delivery | Authenticity - genuine communication over performed leadership |

**Key stat:** CEOs spend 30% of their time with external stakeholders—communication is continuous, not episodic *(McKinsey, 2025)*

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="framework" title="Appearance Element">

## Appearance: From Formal to Authentic

| Old Rules (Pre-2020) | New Rules (2024) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Dress formally at all times | Dress for "new normal" (authenticity over formality) |
| Physical presence = commitment | Show up in person when possible (still signals commitment) |
| Minimize personal brand | Build online image (digital presence matters) |
| Follow dress code rigidly | Authenticity is paramount |

**Key insight:** Appearance is now the LEAST important of the three elements, but authenticity is the MOST important sub-component *(Hewlett, 2024)*

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="CEO Communication Framework">

## The EDGE Framework for Executive Communications

*Based on 80+ CEO interviews (McKinsey, 2025)*

| Element | Focus | Application to You |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **E – Expanded** | Communicate to multiple stakeholder groups | Your presentation addresses faculty, peers, and guests |
| **D – Distinctive** | Develop personal narrative ("The Four W's") | Your unique perspective and story |
| **G – Growth-oriented** | Empower multiple voices | Team presentations require coordination |
| **E – Engaged** | Maintain consistent rhythm | Rehearsal consistency, not last-minute prep |

### The Four W's Narrative Structure:

1. **Who you are** – Identity, values (authenticity)
2. **Why you are here** – Purpose, mission (motivation)
3. **What you will achieve** – Agenda with accountability (vision)
4. **When you will execute** – Timeline and immediate actions (urgency)

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Executive Presence Success Factors">

## Success Factors for Developing Executive Presence

### Gravitas Development:
- **Build deep expertise** in your domain—mastery creates confidence
- **Practice decisiveness** in low-stakes situations to develop muscle memory
- **Seek diverse perspectives** actively—ask "What am I missing?"
- **Own your mistakes** publicly—builds credibility and psychological safety

### Communication Development:
- **Record yourself** presenting—watch for verbal tics, pace, energy
- **Practice "listen to learn"**—ask 3 clarifying questions before responding
- **Master virtual presence**—test lighting, camera angle, background before important meetings
- **Develop vocal variety**—pitch, pace, pause, volume create engagement

### Appearance Development:
- **Audit your digital footprint**—Google yourself, review social media
- **Dress one level up** from audience expectations
- **Maintain energy**—physical fitness impacts executive presence
- **Be consistently authentic**—people notice when you're performing versus being genuine

<!-- SEGMENT 2: CRISIS COMMUNICATION -->

<slide number="13" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2 Introduction">

# SEGMENT 2

## Crisis Communication Fundamentals

*Responding strategically when stakes are highest*

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="SCCT Foundation">

## Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)

**Definition:** A prescriptive framework that matches crisis response strategies to crisis types based on stakeholder attribution of organizational responsibility *(Coombs, 2007)*

### Core Mechanism

**Attribution Theory:** Stakeholders assess whether crises resulted from situational (external) or organizational (internal) factors

**Key Insight:** Attribution of responsibility drives emotional and behavioral responses

**Application:** Match response intensity to perceived responsibility level

**Foundation:** SCCT is the first empirically-tested, evidence-based crisis communication theory—not just case studies, but experimental validation

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="Crisis Type Clusters">

## Three Crisis Clusters Based on Responsibility

| Cluster | Responsibility Level | Examples |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **VICTIM** | Low (external attribution) | Natural disasters, rumors, workplace violence, product tampering (external) |
| **ACCIDENTAL** | Moderate (mixed attribution) | Technical-error accidents, stakeholder challenges, technical product harm |
| **INTENTIONAL/PREVENTABLE** | High (internal attribution) | Human-error accidents, organizational misdeed, management misconduct |

**Critical rule:** Crisis history and prior reputation act as "intensifying factors" that escalate required response level

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="framework" title="Crisis Response Strategies">

## Four Crisis Response Postures

| Posture | Strategies | Best For | Risk |
|---------|-----------|----------|------|
| **DENY** | Attack accuser, denial, scapegoating | Misinformation situations ONLY | Severe credibility damage if misapplied |
| **DIMINISH** | Excuse, justification | Accidental cluster crises | Insufficient for intentional crises |
| **REBUILD** | Compensation, full apology | Intentional/preventable crises | Expensive, admits fault |
| **BOLSTERING** | Remind of past good works, ingratiation | Supplementary strategy only | Cannot stand alone |

**Matching rule:** Higher perceived responsibility requires more accommodative responses

### Ethical Base Response for ALL Crises:
- **Instructing information** (safety guidance)
- **Adjusting information** (expressing concern)

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Crisis Response Examples">

## SCCT in Action: Response Strategy Examples

### Victim Cluster → Deny/Diminish
**Crisis:** Competitor spreads false rumor about your product quality
**Response:** "This claim is categorically false. Our products meet all safety standards, as verified by independent testing. We're pursuing legal action against those spreading misinformation."

### Accidental Cluster → Diminish
**Crisis:** Equipment malfunction causes service interruption despite regular maintenance
**Response:** "We experienced an unexpected equipment failure that affected service. Our maintenance records show regular inspections, and we're implementing additional safeguards to prevent recurrence. We apologize for the inconvenience."

### Intentional/Preventable → Rebuild
**Crisis:** Data breach due to inadequate security protocols
**Response:** "We failed to protect customer data, and that's on us. We're implementing immediate security upgrades, offering credit monitoring to affected customers, and conducting a full third-party security audit. This should not have happened, and we take full responsibility."

</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Crisis Case Study">

## Case Study: David Ellison (Paramount CEO)

**Context:** New CEO writing first stakeholder communication

**Crisis potential:** Media industry in turmoil, stakeholder skepticism

**Action:** Wrote CEO letter positioning sports as "powerful engine for audience engagement"

**Timeline:** Less than one week later, secured $7.7 billion UFC media rights deal

**Outcome:** Words aligned with action—built immediate credibility

**Lesson:** "Show and tell"—your crisis response must be backed by tangible action *(McKinsey, 2025)*

### Application to Your Presentations

- If something goes wrong, acknowledge it immediately (adjusting information)
- Explain what you're doing about it (instructing information)
- Follow through with action (show, don't just tell)

<slide number="19" layout="quote" title="CEO Quotes on Communication">

> "Nothing prepares you for becoming the face of a company. Nothing."

<!-- SEGMENT 3: DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS & Q&A -->

<slide number="20" layout="section-break" title="Segment 3 Introduction">

# SEGMENT 3

## Difficult Conversations & Q&A Mastery

*Navigating interpersonal pressure with grace*

</slide>

<slide number="21" layout="framework" title="Three Conversations Model">

## The Three Conversations Model (Harvard Negotiation Project)

**Core insight:** Every difficult conversation contains three separate conversations happening simultaneously *(Stone, Patton, & Heen, 2023)*

### The Three Layers

**1. The "What Happened?" Conversation**
- **Focus:** Disagreements about facts, interpretations, blame
- **Common mistake:** Assuming certainty about what happened
- **Key technique:** "The And Stance"—both perspectives can be valid simultaneously
- **Critical insight:** Separate intent from impact—never assume you know why someone acted

**2. The Feelings Conversation**
- **Focus:** Emotions underlying the exchange (acknowledged or not)
- **Common mistake:** Ignoring or venting emotions
- **Key technique:** Describe feelings rather than express them reactively

**3. The Identity Conversation**
- **Focus:** Internal dialogue about what this means for who we are
- **Common mistake:** All-or-nothing identity thinking
- **Key technique:** Accept your own complexity

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="framework" title="Learning Conversation Approach">

## Transforming Difficult Conversations into Learning Conversations

### Starting Point: The "Third Story"

Begin from how a neutral observer would describe the situation (not your version or their version)

### Core Techniques

**1. Use inquiry, paraphrasing, and acknowledgment**
- "Help me understand your perspective..."
- "What I'm hearing is... Is that right?"

**2. "Tempered speech" vs. exaggeration**
- "I felt surprised when..." (not "You ALWAYS do this")

**3. Share perspective AS perspective, not absolute truth**
- "From my perspective..." (not "The truth is...")

**Goal:** Transform difficult conversation into learning conversation

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="framework" title="Q&A Framework">

## Mastering Q&A Sessions Without Defensiveness

### Four-Step Q&A Framework

**Step 1: ACKNOWLEDGE the question**
- "That's an excellent question"
- "I appreciate you raising that"
- **Benefit:** Shows respect, buys thinking time

**Step 2: CLARIFY if needed**
- "Just to make sure I understand, are you asking about X or Y?"
- **Benefit:** Prevents answering the wrong question

**Step 3: ANSWER directly**
- Address the question asked, not the question you wish they'd asked
- **If you don't know:** "I don't have that data, but I can find out"

**Step 4: CHECK understanding**
- "Does that address your question?"
- **Benefit:** Opens dialogue, prevents assumptions

### Handling Hostile Questions

- Use Three Conversations Model: Separate intent from impact
- Assume positive intent: "They're testing my knowledge, not attacking me"
- Stay calm: Pause, breathe, respond (don't react)

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Q&A Case Study">

## Case Study: Handling Surprise Questions

**Scenario:** Student presenting marketing plan; professor asks: "Why didn't you consider influencer marketing? That's the obvious strategy for Gen Z."

### Poor Response (Defensive)

"We did consider it! It's just not in the slides because we ran out of time."

**Analysis:** Defensive tone, makes excuses, sounds unprepared

### Strong Response (Executive Presence)

"Excellent question—influencer marketing is highly relevant for Gen Z. We evaluated it and chose not to prioritize it for two reasons: budget constraints and timeline. However, I'd be happy to discuss how we'd incorporate it in Phase 2. Would that be helpful?"

### Why This Works:

- Acknowledges question (shows respect)
- Answers directly (transparency)
- Provides reasoning (demonstrates thought process)
- Offers to continue dialogue (engagement)

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="framework" title="Advanced Q&A Techniques">

## Advanced Techniques for Really Tough Questions

### The "Bridge" Technique

**When:** Question is off-topic or unanswerable

**How:** Bridge to what you CAN discuss

**Example:**
- *Question:* "What's your company's revenue projection for 2030?"
- *Bridge:* "While I don't have 2030 projections, what I can share is our current growth trajectory and the market factors that will influence long-term performance..."

### The "Parking Lot" Technique

**When:** Question deserves deep discussion but time is limited

**Example:** "That's a complex question that deserves more than a quick answer. Can we add that to the parking lot and discuss it in detail after the presentation?"

### The "Turn It Back" Technique

**When:** Question is really an opinion disguised as a question

**Example:**
- *Question:* "Don't you think email marketing is dead?"
- *Response:* "That's an interesting perspective. What makes you think that?" *(Then address after hearing their reasoning)*

## Integration & Application

*Bringing it all together for your presentations*

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="framework" title="Framework Integration">

## How the Frameworks Work Together

| Pressure Situation | Framework to Apply | Key Action |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Building overall credibility | Executive Presence Model | Focus on gravitas (confidence + respect) and communication (virtual + listening) |
| Something goes wrong | SCCT Crisis Response | Match response to responsibility level: acknowledge (adjusting info) + explain fix (instructing info) |
| Team conflict during prep | Three Conversations Model | Use "Third Story" + separate intent from impact |
| Challenging Q&A question | Four-Step Q&A Framework | Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check |

**Integration principle:** All frameworks share common foundation—stay calm, show respect, respond (don't react)

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="content" title="Comprehensive Case Study">

## Comprehensive Case: The Perfect Storm

**Scenario:** Your team is presenting on sustainable business practices.

### Crisis 1: Technology fails—slides won't display

**Framework:** SCCT (accidental cluster)

**Response:** "We're experiencing a technical issue. While we troubleshoot, let me walk you through our key findings verbally..." *(adjusting info + instructing info)*

**Executive presence:** Maintain gravitas—stay calm, be decisive

### Crisis 2: During Q&A, audience member aggressively challenges your data

**Framework:** Four-Step Q&A + Three Conversations Model

**Response:** "Thank you for that question *(acknowledge)*. Just to clarify, are you questioning our data sources or our interpretation? *(clarify)*. Our data comes from [source], and here's our methodology... *(answer)*. Does that address your concern? *(check)*"

**Mindset:** Separate intent from impact—they're testing rigor, not attacking you personally

### Crisis 3: After presentation, teammate blames you for tech failure

**Framework:** Three Conversations Model

**Response:** "I know we're both frustrated. From my perspective, the tech failure was unexpected—I tested everything yesterday. I'm guessing you're concerned about how it affected our grade? Can we talk about what we can learn from this?"

## High-Stakes Communication in Vietnamese Context

### Executive Presence Adaptations

**Gravitas in Vietnamese culture:**
- Balance confidence with humility
- Show respect for hierarchy while demonstrating expertise
- Inclusiveness includes deference to seniority

**Communication adaptations:**
- Indirect communication can be culturally appropriate
- "From my perspective" shows respect while expressing views
- Active listening especially important across hierarchical differences

- Group harmony often prioritized over individual accountability
- SCCT still applies, but tone requires cultural calibration

### Difficult Conversations Cultural Nuances

- Third Story particularly important in hierarchical contexts
- Separating intent from impact helps navigate face concerns
- Tempered speech aligns with Vietnamese communication norms
