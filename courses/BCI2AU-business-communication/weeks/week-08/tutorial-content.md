# Week 8 Tutorial: Executive Presence Practice

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12) - this activity practices Q&A Performance (15% of presentation grade). The Group Presentation includes a mandatory 10-minute Q&A where you'll be assessed on handling challenging questions with composure and expertise.

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Executive Presence Model (Hewlett, 2024):** Three elements—Gravitas (confidence + inclusiveness, most important), Communication (virtual presence + listening), Appearance (authenticity over formality). Gravitas = 67% of what senior executives value. Sound of voice matters 2x as much as content.

- **Four-Step Q&A Framework:** (1) Acknowledge question ("Great question"), (2) Clarify if needed ("Are you asking about X or Y?"), (3) Answer directly (if you don't know, say so), (4) Check understanding ("Does that address your concern?"). Assume positive intent, stay calm, respond (don't react).

- **Advanced Q&A Techniques:** Bridge (redirect to related topic you CAN discuss), Parking Lot (defer complex questions for later), Turn It Back (engage their reasoning when question is really a statement). Never fake knowledge—honesty builds credibility.

**What good work looks like:**
- Handles all questions brilliantly; demonstrates expert knowledge
- Remains composed under pressure; doesn't become defensive
- Acknowledges questions respectfully before answering
- Answers directly and concisely; admits knowledge gaps when appropriate

## Main Activity: Hot Seat Q&A Practice

**Assessment Connection:** Group Presentation (Due Week 12) - this activity practices handling challenging questions under pressure, the exact skill assessed in Q&A Performance (15% of presentation grade).

**The Task:**
Deliver a 2-minute presentation on your team's topic, then defend it during a 3-minute Q&A where peers ask challenging and unexpected questions. This mirrors the pressure of Week 12's mandatory 10-minute Q&A session.

**Deliverable:**
- 2-minute presentation introducing your topic and main argument
- 3-minute Q&A defense responding to challenging questions
- Individual written reflection (150 words) on performance and improvement areas

**Success Criteria:** (from Presentation Rubric - Q&A Performance)
- Handles all questions brilliantly; demonstrates expert knowledge of topic
- Remains composed under pressure; no defensiveness or discomfort
- Acknowledges questions respectfully and answers directly
- Uses Q&A frameworks effectively (acknowledge, clarify, answer, check)

### Activity Structure

**Setup (Groups of 5-6 students):**
- Each student takes turns in the "hot seat" for 5 minutes total (2 min presentation + 3 min Q&A)
- Other group members serve as audience and questioners
- One person acts as timekeeper and tracks time
- All students must be prepared to present and question

---

### Your Role as Presenter (2 min + 3 min)

**Part 1: Presentation (2 minutes)**

Present a concise overview of your Week 12 topic:
1. **Opening (20 sec):** Hook the audience with why this topic matters
2. **Main argument (60 sec):** State your key claim and 2-3 supporting points
3. **Evidence (30 sec):** Share one compelling example or data point
4. **Transition to Q&A (10 sec):** "I'm happy to answer your questions"

**Tips:**
- Practice executive presence: Stand confidently, make eye contact, speak clearly
- Don't apologize or use hedging language ("I'm not an expert, but...")
- Project gravitas: You ARE the expert on this topic for the next 5 minutes

**Part 2: Q&A Defense (3 minutes)**

Respond to challenging questions using the Four-Step Framework:

**Step 1 - ACKNOWLEDGE:**
- "That's an excellent question"
- "I appreciate you raising that"
- "Great observation"

**Step 2 - CLARIFY (if needed):**
- "Just to make sure I understand, are you asking about X or Y?"
- "Can you clarify what aspect you'd like me to address?"

**Step 3 - ANSWER directly:**
- Address the question asked (not the question you wish they'd asked)
- Be concise: 20-30 seconds per answer
- If you don't know: "I don't have that data, but here's how I'd find out..."
- Use evidence when possible: "According to [source]..."

**Step 4 - CHECK understanding:**
- "Does that address your question?"
- "Would you like me to elaborate on any part?"

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Bridge:** "While I don't have 2030 projections, what I can share is our current growth trajectory..."
- **Parking Lot:** "That's complex and deserves more than a quick answer. Can we discuss it in detail after?"
- **Turn It Back:** "That's interesting. What makes you think that?" (for opinions disguised as questions)

### Your Role as Questioner

**Goal:** Help your peers practice handling pressure through challenging but fair questions.

**Question Types to Use:**

**1. Clarification Challenges:**
- "You mentioned [concept]—can you define that more precisely?"
- "I didn't understand your reasoning on [point]. Can you explain?"

**2. Evidence Requests:**
- "What data supports that conclusion?"
- "How do you know this is true?"
- "Can you cite your sources for that claim?"

**3. Alternative Perspectives:**
- "Some experts argue the opposite. How do you respond?"
- "Have you considered [alternative approach]?"
- "What about the counterargument that...?"

**4. Application Tests:**
- "How would this work in [different context]?"
- "What if your assumption about [X] is wrong?"
- "Can you give a real-world example?"

**5. Unexpected Angles:**
- "Why didn't you address [related topic]?"
- "This seems obvious. What's actually innovative here?"
- "How do you respond to [recent news/trend]?"

**Guidelines:**
- Ask questions that test thinking, not obscure facts
- Challenging but respectful—you're helping them practice, not attacking
- Vietnamese context note: In academic settings, questioning demonstrates engagement, not disrespect. Frame questions with: "I'm curious about..." or "Could you help me understand..."
- If presenter struggles, don't pile on—give them space to recover

### Written Reflection (Individual, 15 min at end)

After completing all hot seat rounds, write a 150-word reflection addressing:

1. **Q&A Performance:** Which questions were hardest to handle? Why?
2. **Framework Application:** Which step of the Four-Step Framework felt most natural? Which needs practice?
3. **Executive Presence:** How well did you maintain composure under pressure? What triggered defensiveness or uncertainty?
4. **Improvement Plan:** What specific skill will you practice before Week 12's graded Q&A?

**Format:** Submit via Moodle by end of tutorial session

**Example reflection opening:**
> "The hardest question was when [peer] asked about alternative approaches I hadn't considered. I stumbled because I jumped to answering without acknowledging the question first. This showed me I need to practice Step 1 (acknowledge) when I feel defensive. Before Week 12, I'll prepare responses to 10 potential challenging questions and practice acknowledging each one before answering."

---

**Class Feedback:**
At the end of the session, 4-6 students will share one insight from their written reflection. Be prepared to:
- Share one challenging moment and how you handled it
- Identify one specific improvement before Week 12
- Answer one question from peers about your experience

⚠️ **Participation:** You must complete the hot seat presentation, Q&A defense, and written reflection. Incomplete work will affect your participation marks (10% of final grade).
