    question: |
      What distinguishes gravitas from appearance and communication in the Executive Presence Framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Confidence and decisiveness under pressure, inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives, and demonstrated competence"
        feedback: "Correct! Gravitas encompasses these three dimensions: confidence and decisiveness under pressure, inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives, and demonstrated competence."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Physical appearance, commanding voice, and formal presentation skills"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These relate to the appearance and communication elements, not gravitas. Gravitas focuses on confidence, decisiveness, inclusiveness, and competence."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Educational credentials, professional dress, and social status"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Gravitas is not about credentials or appearance. The updated model de-emphasizes pedigree and prioritizes demonstrated competence through actions and decision-making."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Popularity with colleagues, charisma, and public speaking ability"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While related to presence, gravitas specifically emphasizes decisiveness under pressure and inclusive leadership, not popularity or natural charisma."

    general_feedback: |
      Gravitas in the Executive Presence Framework comprises three core elements: (1) **confidence** (self-assurance and composure), (2) **decisiveness** (making clear decisions under pressure), (3) **inclusiveness** (respecting diverse perspectives), and (4) **demonstrated competence** (proven capability through actions rather than credentials). The post-pandemic shift moved from **pedigree** (educational background and status) to demonstrated competence. See Week 8 slides 5-7.

    topic: "Executive Presence Framework"

    question: |
      What are the three elements of the Executive Presence Framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Gravitas, Communication, and Appearance"
        feedback: "Correct! The framework identifies three core elements: Gravitas (confidence and decisiveness), Communication (superior speaking and listening), and Appearance (authenticity and digital presence)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Confidence, Credibility, and Charisma"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While these relate to executive presence, they are not the three formal framework elements. The three elements are Gravitas, Communication, and Appearance."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Strategic thinking, relationship building, and emotional intelligence"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These describe broader leadership competencies, not the specific three elements of the Executive Presence Framework."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Technical expertise, soft skills, and interpersonal awareness"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The framework's three elements are Gravitas, Communication, and Appearance—not divided into technical and soft skills."

    general_feedback: |
      The Executive Presence Framework comprises three elements: (1) **Gravitas**—confidence and decisiveness under pressure, (2) **Communication**—superior speaking and **active listening** (genuinely understanding others), and (3) **Appearance**—**authenticity** (being genuine) and **digital presence** (professional image online). Post-pandemic research shows gravitas is most important (67% of executives), communication second, and appearance least important but requiring authenticity. See Week 8 slides 5-9.

  - id: "W8-Q3-listen-to-learn-vs-respond"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Executive Presence Framework"

    question: |
      How does "listen to learn" differ from "listen to respond" in the communication element of the Executive Presence Framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "'Listen to learn' involves genuine curiosity and understanding; 'listen to respond' means waiting for your turn to speak while formulating your reply"
        feedback: "Correct! 'Listen to learn' represents active engagement with genuine curiosity about others' perspectives. 'Listen to respond' is passive waiting while thinking about your counter-argument. This distinction emphasizes authentic engagement."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "'Listen to learn' means staying silent; 'listen to respond' means asking questions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This reverses the meanings. 'Listen to learn' actively seeks understanding through both listening and questions. 'Listen to respond' focuses on formulating rebuttals."

      - key: "C"
        text: "'Listen to learn' is for one-on-one conversations; 'listen to respond' is for presentations"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both orientations apply across all contexts. The Executive Presence Model positions 'listen to learn' as superior regardless of setting—it builds trust and credibility everywhere."

      - key: "D"
        text: "'Listen to learn' requires note-taking; 'listen to respond' does not"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Note-taking is a tactic. The difference is the underlying mindset: genuine curiosity seeking understanding vs. passive waiting to formulate counter-arguments."

    general_feedback: |
      "Listen to learn" reflects **genuine curiosity** (sincere interest in understanding others' viewpoints) and **active engagement** (focused attention on understanding). "Listen to respond" means **passively** waiting for your turn while mentally preparing counter-arguments. Leaders practicing "listen to learn" build **psychological safety** (an environment where people feel safe contributing) and are perceived as more effective. This shift represents a move from **transactional** (exchange-focused) to **relational** (relationship-focused) communication. See Week 8 slide 8.

  - id: "W8-Q4-scct-crisis-clusters"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)"

    question: |
      What are the three crisis clusters in Situational Crisis Communication Theory, and how do they differ in responsibility attribution?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Victim (low responsibility), Accidental (moderate responsibility), Intentional/Preventable (high responsibility)"
        feedback: "Correct! SCCT categorizes crises into three clusters based on stakeholder attribution of organizational responsibility: Victim (external attribution), Accidental (mixed attribution), and Intentional/Preventable (internal attribution)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Internal (high), Mixed (moderate), External (low)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While responsibility levels are correct, SCCT uses specific cluster names: Victim, Accidental, and Intentional/Preventable—not Internal/Mixed/External."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Minor (low), Moderate (medium), Major (high)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. SCCT does not categorize by crisis size or severity. The three clusters are based on stakeholder responsibility attribution, not magnitude."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Preventable, Unpredictable, and Predictable"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These describe crisis characteristics. SCCT's three clusters are Victim (low responsibility), Accidental (moderate responsibility), and Intentional/Preventable (high responsibility)."

    general_feedback: |
      SCCT's three crisis clusters based on **stakeholder attribution** (how people assign responsibility): (1) **Victim** cluster—external attribution, low responsibility (natural disaster, product tampering); (2) **Accidental** cluster—mixed attribution, moderate responsibility (equipment malfunction, technical error); (3) **Intentional/Preventable** cluster—internal attribution, high responsibility (safety shortcuts, misconduct). **Attribution Theory** posits that stakeholders assign blame based on perceived causes. Matching response intensity to attribution level is critical. See Week 8 slide 13.

  - id: "W8-Q5-intensifying-factors"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)"

    question: |
      In SCCT, how do intensifying factors change the response strategy required for a crisis?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Intensifying factors allow organizations to use less accommodative responses"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Intensifying factors escalate required response intensity. Organizations with crisis history or poor reputation must use more accommodative responses, not fewer."
        correct: false

      - key: "B"
        text: "Intensifying factors escalate the required response level, requiring more accommodative and apologetic responses"
        feedback: "Correct! If an organization has prior crisis history or poor reputation, stakeholders attribute more responsibility. This escalates required response level from minimizing responses (deny/diminish) to accommodative responses (rebuild)."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Intensifying factors determine which crisis cluster the crisis belongs to"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The crisis cluster is determined by the event itself (external, mixed, or internal). Intensifying factors escalate response intensity but don't determine the cluster."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Intensifying factors only affect victim cluster crises"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Intensifying factors apply across all clusters. Prior reputation issues escalate required response for victim, accidental, and intentional/preventable crises."

    general_feedback: |
      **Intensifying factors**—prior **crisis history** (previous similar incidents) and **reputation** (stakeholder perception of organizational character)—escalate required response intensity across all crisis clusters. If an organization has experienced similar crises or has poor reputation, stakeholders attribute more responsibility, requiring more **accommodative** (apologetic, compensatory, and relationship-focused) responses. An organization with spotless reputation can use **diminishing** (excuse, justification) posture; one with crisis history must use **rebuilding** (compensation, apology) posture. See Week 8 slide 14.

  - id: "W8-Q6-ethical-base-response-components"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)"

    question: |
      What are the two components of the ethical base response in SCCT, and how do they work together?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Instructing information (safety guidance) and adjusting information (expressing concern) address both practical and emotional stakeholder needs across all crisis types"
        feedback: "Correct! The ethical base response combines: (1) Instructing information—practical guidance on what stakeholders should do, (2) Adjusting information—emotional support showing organizational concern. Both apply to every crisis."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Instructing and adjusting information are only necessary for victim cluster crises"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The ethical base response applies universally to all crisis clusters—victim, accidental, and intentional/preventable. Both components are required regardless."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Instructing information alone is sufficient; adjusting information is optional"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both are necessary. Instructing information addresses 'what should I do?' Adjusting information addresses 'does the organization care?' Both are essential."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Adjusting information means taking full responsibility; instructing information means providing directions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Adjusting information means expressing concern for stakeholder welfare—not necessarily admitting fault. It addresses emotional needs, while instructing information addresses practical needs."

    general_feedback: |
      The ethical base response in SCCT combines two complementary components: (1) **Instructing information**—practical, actionable guidance addressing stakeholder safety and welfare; (2) **Adjusting information**—**empathetic** (understanding and caring about feelings) communication expressing organizational concern. **Instructing** answers: "What should I do?" **Adjusting** answers: "Does the organization care about me?" Together they address both **cognitive** (thinking, practical) and **affective** (emotional, feeling) stakeholder needs. This foundation applies **universally** to all crisis types. See Week 8 slide 15.

  - id: "W8-Q7-three-conversations-layers"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Stone's Three Conversations Model"

    question: |
      What are the three layers of conversation that occur simultaneously in every difficult conversation according to Stone's Three Conversations Model?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "'What Happened?' conversation (facts and blame), Feelings conversation (emotions), and Identity conversation (self-concept concerns)"
        feedback: "Correct! Every difficult conversation contains three simultaneous layers: What Happened (about facts and blame), Feelings (about emotions), and Identity (about self-concept and competence)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Opening conversation, middle conversation, and closing conversation"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These describe time sequence, not the three layers. The model identifies What Happened, Feelings, and Identity as simultaneous conversations, not sequential segments."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Verbal conversation, non-verbal conversation, and written communication"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These describe communication channels. The framework identifies What Happened (facts), Feelings (emotions), and Identity (self-concept) as the three simultaneous conversation types."

      - key: "D"
        text: "My perspective, your perspective, and the objective truth"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While the 'What Happened?' layer involves different perspectives, the framework has three distinct layers: What Happened (facts/blame), Feelings (emotions), and Identity (self-concept)."

    general_feedback: |
      Stone's Three Conversations Model identifies three **simultaneous** (happening at the same time) conversation layers in every difficult interaction: (1) **'What Happened?' conversation**—**interpretations** (meanings assigned to events) and **attributions** (assigning blame); (2) **Feelings conversation**—**emotions** (affective responses) underlying the exchange; (3) **Identity conversation**—internal dialogue about **self-concept** (who we think we are) and **competence** (capability and adequacy). Most people focus only on facts; missing the feelings and identity layers creates escalation. See Week 8 slides 17-18.

  - id: "W8-Q8-and-stance-purpose"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Stone's Three Conversations Model"

    question: |
      In the Three Conversations Model, what does the "And Stance" do in the "What Happened?" layer of difficult conversations?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "It recognizes both perspectives can be valid simultaneously, transforming dialogue from debate to mutual understanding"
        feedback: "Correct! The 'And Stance' shifts from 'I'm right and you're wrong' to 'You see it this way AND I see it that way.' This creates psychological safety and enables learning."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "It means accepting all blame without discussing the other person's perspective"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The And Stance does not mean accepting all blame. It acknowledges both perspectives as potentially valid, not that one is entirely correct and the other wrong."

      - key: "C"
        text: "It merges two conflicting viewpoints into a compromise position"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The And Stance doesn't force compromise. It recognizes different perspectives as potentially valid given different information or experiences, opening dialogue rather than resolving it."

      - key: "D"
        text: "It concludes discussions by stating both people are equally right"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The And Stance doesn't conclude discussions. It opens them by acknowledging both perspectives, recognizing that people may have different information and experiences."

    general_feedback: |
      The "And Stance" transforms the "What Happened?" conversation layer from **adversarial** (competing for who's right) to **collaborative** (seeking mutual understanding). It states: "You see it this way AND I see it that way"—recognizing that both perspectives can be **valid** (reasonable and defensible) given different information or **interpretations** (ways of understanding events). This creates **psychological safety** (feeling safe to express viewpoints without fear of punishment) and shifts from **debate** (proving one position correct) to **learning** (understanding different perspectives). See Week 8 slide 19.

  - id: "W8-Q9-third-story-function"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Stone's Three Conversations Model"

    question: |
      Why does the Three Conversations Model recommend starting difficult conversations with "the Third Story" rather than with your version or their version?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "It provides a neutral, objective starting point that avoids blame and creates psychological safety for dialogue"
        feedback: "Correct! The Third Story (how a neutral observer would describe the situation) shifts from debate about correctness to mutual understanding. It creates common ground and reduces defensiveness."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "It proves that your perspective is the most accurate"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Third Story doesn't validate one perspective over another. It provides neutral ground for both parties to understand their different viewpoints."

      - key: "C"
        text: "It forces both people to compromise on the actual facts"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Third Story doesn't force compromise. It provides neutral ground from which to discuss factual disagreements without blame."

      - key: "D"
        text: "It allows you to control the conversation narrative"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The Third Story approach is designed to reduce control dynamics and defensiveness. It opens dialogue rather than controlling outcomes."

    general_feedback: |
      The "Third Story" technique starts difficult conversations from a **neutral, objective** description—how a mediator would describe the situation without bias. This shifts from **blame-oriented** (identifying who is wrong) to **learning-oriented** (understanding differences) conversations. It creates **psychological safety** by positioning both parties as collaborative rather than adversarial. Starting with "your version" triggers defensiveness in the other person; starting with "their version" feels dismissive to you. The Third Story avoids both **egocentric** (self-centered) perspectives, opening genuine dialogue. See Week 8 slide 20.

  - id: "W8-Q10-four-step-qa-framework"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Q&A Framework"

    question: |
      Why does the Q&A Framework place Acknowledge before Answer in its sequence?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "It shows respect for the questioner and provides 2-3 seconds of thinking time to compose a thoughtful response"
        feedback: "Correct! Acknowledgment serves two critical functions: it signals respect for the questioner, and it provides composure time before responding. This prevents defensive reactions."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "It allows you to dismiss the question before actually addressing it"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Acknowledgment does the opposite—it shows the question deserves serious attention. Dismissing questions damages credibility."

      - key: "C"
        text: "It requires you to agree with the questioner's underlying assumptions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Acknowledging a question shows respect for the person and their input—not agreement with the question's premises. You can acknowledge and then disagree."

      - key: "D"
        text: "It means jumping immediately to your answer without thinking"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Acknowledge means pausing deliberately to show respect and think carefully. It intentionally slows the process."

    general_feedback: |
      The Q&A Framework places Acknowledge first because it serves dual functions: (1) **Relational**—demonstrates respect for the questioner, building **rapport** (positive relationship); (2) **Cognitive**—provides thinking time that enables **composed** (calm, thoughtful) responses rather than **reactive** (defensive, emotional) ones. Phrases like "That's an excellent question" accomplish both simultaneously. This front-loads the framework with relationship and composure. See Week 8 slide 22.

  - id: "W8-Q11-acknowledge-step-functions"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Q&A Framework"

    question: |
      In the Q&A Framework, what are the two functions of the Acknowledge step?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "It shows respect for the questioner and buys 2-3 seconds of thinking time"
        feedback: "Correct! Step 1 (Acknowledge) serves dual functions: showing respect builds rapport and credibility; gaining thinking time enables composed responses rather than defensive reactions."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "It dismisses the question as unimportant"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Acknowledgment does the opposite—it signals the question deserves respect and attention. Dismissing questions damages credibility."

      - key: "C"
        text: "It means you are agreeing with the questioner's underlying assumptions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Acknowledging a question means respecting the person and their input—not agreeing with the question's premises. You can acknowledge and disagree."

      - key: "D"
        text: "It means providing your complete answer without pausing"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Acknowledge means pausing to show respect and gain thinking time. It's the opposite of rushing to answer."

    general_feedback: |
      The Acknowledge step serves two critical functions: (1) **Relational**—shows respect for the questioner and their input, building **rapport** (positive relationship) and **credibility** (trustworthiness); (2) **Cognitive**—provides 2-3 seconds of thinking time, enabling **composed** (calm, thoughtful) responses rather than **reactive** (defensive, emotional) ones. Phrases like "That's an excellent question" or "I appreciate you raising that" accomplish both. This step demonstrates **executive presence** and prevents the defensive reactions that damage credibility. See Week 8 slide 23.

  - id: "W8-Q12-clarify-step-purpose"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Q&A Framework"

    question: |
      In the Four-Step Q&A Framework, which step comes after Acknowledge?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Clarify (step 2)"
        feedback: "Correct! Step 2 in the Four-Step Q&A Framework is Clarify. The sequence is: Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Answer (step 3)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Answer comes after Clarify, not immediately after Acknowledge. The correct sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Check (step 4)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Check is the final step. The correct sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Respond (not in framework)"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Respond is not one of the four steps. The correct sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check."

    general_feedback: |
      The Four-Step Q&A Framework sequence is: (1) **Acknowledge**—show respect and gain composure; (2) **Clarify**—ensure you understand what's being asked; (3) **Answer**—address the question substance directly; (4) **Check**—confirm the questioner's concern was addressed. The **sequential** (in order) arrangement is critical because acknowledging first establishes respect, and clarifying before answering prevents the common mistake of addressing the wrong question. See Week 8 slide 22.
