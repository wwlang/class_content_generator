::Executive Presence Elements::What are the three elements of executive presence according to Hewlett's model?{
~Confidence, Communication, Charisma
=Gravitas, Communication, Appearance #- **A) Incorrect.** While confidence is part of gravitas and charisma sounds related, these are not the three formal elements Hewlett identifies. The model uses gravitas (which includes confidence), communication, and appearance. - **B) Correct!** Hewlett's Executive Presence Model identifies three measurable components\: gravitas (67% of executives say this matters most), communication (second most important), and appearance (least important but still relevant). - **C) Incorrect.** Speaking and listening are components of the communication element, but they are not the three main elements of the model. The three elements are gravitas, communication, and appearance. - **D) Incorrect.** While authority relates to gravitas and authenticity is important for appearance, these are not the three formal elements. The model specifies gravitas, communication, and appearance.
~Speaking, Listening, Presence
~Authority, Authenticity, Assertiveness
}

::Gravitas Importance::According to Hewlett's research, what percentage of senior executives identify gravitas as the most important element of executive presence?{
~45%
~52%
=67% #- **A) Incorrect.** 45% is too low. Gravitas is considered significantly more important, with 67% of senior executives identifying it as what really matters. - **B) Incorrect.** While this is a majority, the actual figure is higher. 67% of senior executives say gravitas is the most important element. - **C) Correct!** 67% of senior executives say gravitas is what really matters in executive presence, making it the most critical element above communication and appearance. - **D) Incorrect.** 78% is too high. The research shows 67% of executives prioritize gravitas as the most important element.
~78%

::SCCT Crisis Clusters::What are the three crisis clusters in Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)?{
~Minor, Moderate, Major
~Internal, External, Mixed
=Victim, Accidental, Intentional/Preventable #- **A) Incorrect.** SCCT doesn't categorize crises by severity (minor/moderate/major) but rather by responsibility attribution. The three clusters are victim, accidental, and intentional/preventable. - **B) Incorrect.** While SCCT does consider whether crises are internal or external, these are not the names of the three clusters. The clusters are victim, accidental, and intentional/preventable. - **C) Correct!** SCCT categorizes all crises into three clusters based on stakeholder attribution of responsibility\: victim (low responsibility), accidental (moderate responsibility), and intentional/preventable (high responsibility). - **D) Incorrect.** SCCT doesn't use these categories. The three clusters are victim, accidental, and intentional/preventable, based on perceived organizational responsibility.
~Technical, Human, Natural
}

::Three Conversations Model Components::According to the Three Conversations Model from the Harvard Negotiation Project, what are the three separate conversations happening in every difficult interaction?{
=What Happened, Feelings, Identity #- **A) Correct!** The Three Conversations Model identifies three simultaneous layers\: the "What Happened?" conversation (facts and interpretations), the Feelings conversation (emotions), and the Identity conversation (internal dialogue about self-concept). - **B) Incorrect.** While facts and emotions are related to the model, "solutions" is not one of the three conversations. The model identifies "What Happened," Feelings, and Identity as the three layers. - **C) Incorrect.** The model doesn't focus on time periods (past/present/future). The three conversations are "What Happened," Feelings, and Identity. - **D) Incorrect.** These are not the three conversations. The model identifies "What Happened?" (facts), Feelings (emotions), and Identity (self-concept) as the three layers present in difficult conversations.
~Facts, Emotions, Solutions
~Past, Present, Future
~Speaker, Listener, Observer
}

::Four-Step Q&A Framework Sequence::What is the correct sequence of the Four-Step Q&A Framework taught in lecture?{
~Answer → Clarify → Acknowledge → Check
~Clarify → Acknowledge → Answer → Check
=Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check #- **A) Incorrect.** Starting with the answer is too abrupt and doesn't show respect for the question. The correct sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check. - **B) Incorrect.** You need to acknowledge the question first before clarifying. The correct sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check. - **C) Correct!** The Four-Step Q&A Framework follows this sequence\: (1) Acknowledge the question ("That's an excellent question"), (2) Clarify if needed ("Are you asking about X or Y?"), (3) Answer directly, and (4) Check understanding ("Does that address your question?"). - **D) Incorrect.** Clarifying should come before answering to ensure you understand the question correctly. The right sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check.
~Acknowledge → Answer → Clarify → Check
}

::Gravitas vs. Authority::According to Hewlett's updated Executive Presence Model, is gravitas primarily about demonstrating authority through pedigree (which school you attended)?{
~True - Pedigree and educational background define gravitas
=False - Modern gravitas emphasizes demonstrated competence over pedigree #- **A) Incorrect.** This was true in the old model (pre-2012), but Hewlett's updated research shows pedigree is now less important. Modern gravitas focuses on confidence under pressure and inclusiveness, not educational credentials. - **B) Correct!** A key shift in Hewlett's updated model (2012 vs. 2022) is that pedigree is now less important than demonstrated competence. Modern gravitas emphasizes confidence under pressure combined with inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives—not educational background or credentials. - **C) Incorrect.** While elite schools may have been valued in the past, the updated Executive Presence Model shows this is no longer the primary factor. Gravitas now emphasizes performance and inclusive leadership over pedigree. - **D) Incorrect.** While this correctly states that pedigree isn't important, gravitas is not about physical appearance—that's the separate "Appearance" element. Gravitas focuses on confidence, decisiveness, and inclusiveness.
~True - Elite school attendance is the most important factor
~False - Gravitas is entirely about physical appearance
}

::Crisis Response Matching Purpose::Why does SCCT recommend matching crisis response strategies to the level of perceived organizational responsibility?{
~Because more serious crises require longer press releases
=Because stakeholder attribution of responsibility drives their emotional and behavioral responses #- **A) Incorrect.** Response length is not the reason for matching. SCCT is based on attribution theory—stakeholders' perception of responsibility drives their reactions, so responses must match that perception level. - **B) Correct!** SCCT is grounded in attribution theory, which shows that stakeholders assess whether crises resulted from situational (external) or organizational (internal) factors. This attribution of responsibility drives their emotional and behavioral responses, so organizations must match response intensity to perceived responsibility level to be effective. - **C) Incorrect.** While legal considerations may exist, SCCT's matching principle is based on stakeholder psychology, not legal liability. The framework focuses on how stakeholders attribute responsibility and how that drives their reactions. - **D) Incorrect.** Media coverage is a factor in crisis management, but SCCT's matching principle is based on stakeholder attribution of responsibility, not media intensity. The framework addresses how stakeholders perceive and respond to responsibility.
~Because legal liability increases with crisis severity
~Because media coverage intensity varies by crisis type
}

::"Third Story" Technique::In the Three Conversations Model, what is the purpose of starting a difficult conversation with the "Third Story"?{
~To protect yourself by having a witness present
=To begin from how a neutral observer would describe the situation, rather than your version or their version #- **A) Incorrect.** "Third Story" doesn't refer to having a third person present. It means describing the situation from a neutral observer's perspective—neither your version nor their version—to start the conversation on common ground. - **B) Correct!** The "Third Story" technique means beginning the conversation from how a neutral, objective observer would describe the situation. This approach avoids starting with blame or competing narratives ("I'm right, you're wrong") and instead creates a shared starting point that both parties can work from. - **C) Incorrect.** The "Third Story" isn't about delay tactics. It's about framing the conversation neutrally from the start, which actually helps address the issue more effectively by reducing defensiveness. - **D) Incorrect.** The purpose is the opposite—to avoid dominance or control. "Third Story" creates neutral ground by describing the situation as an objective observer would, which reduces power dynamics and defensiveness.
~To delay addressing the real issue until emotions calm down
~To establish dominance by controlling the narrative

::Communication Element Post-Pandemic::According to Hewlett's updated Executive Presence Model, is virtual presence (comfort on Zoom) now a mandatory component of the communication element?{
~False - Virtual presence is optional and less important than in-person skills
=True - Virtual presence is now a mandatory core component #- **A) Incorrect.** Virtual presence is not optional in the updated model. The post-pandemic research shows "comfort on Zoom" is now an essential skill, equal in importance to in-person communication abilities. - **B) Correct!** The post-pandemic addition to the communication element explicitly includes "comfort on Zoom" as a new essential skill. The lecture notes that traditional skills like "command a room in person" now have a virtual equivalent—you must perform effectively on Zoom as well as in person. Virtual presence is no longer optional; it's a core component of executive communication. - **C) Incorrect.** Virtual presence is required across all roles at the executive level, not just technical positions. The updated Executive Presence Model shows this is a universal expectation for leaders post-pandemic. - **D) Incorrect.** While the statement that virtual presence is mandatory is correct, it's not limited to remote workers. All executives need virtual communication skills, as hybrid work and virtual stakeholder meetings are now standard across organizations.
~False - Only technical roles need virtual presence skills
~True - But only for remote workers, not executives
}

::Intent vs. Impact Separation::In the Three Conversations Model, why is it critical to separate intent from impact when navigating difficult conversations?{
~Because it allows you to avoid taking responsibility for your actions
=Because assuming you know someone's intentions often leads to misunderstanding and defensiveness #- **A) Incorrect.** Separating intent from impact isn't about avoiding responsibility. It's about recognizing that you can't know why someone acted (their intent) just from how it affected you (impact), which prevents misattribution and defensiveness. - **B) Correct!** The Three Conversations Model emphasizes that we never truly know why someone acted (intent)—we only know how it affected us (impact). Assuming we know their intent ("You did this to hurt me") leads to misunderstanding and defensiveness. Separating these allows for productive dialogue\: "This is how it affected me" rather than "This is why you did it." - **C) Incorrect.** While impact may matter in legal contexts, the Three Conversations Model is about interpersonal communication psychology, not law. The reason to separate intent from impact is to avoid misattribution and reduce defensiveness. - **D) Incorrect.** The model is designed to transform difficult conversations into learning conversations, not to win arguments. Separating intent from impact reduces conflict, not increases it.
~Because impact matters more than intent in legal contexts
~Because it helps you win arguments by focusing on their mistakes
