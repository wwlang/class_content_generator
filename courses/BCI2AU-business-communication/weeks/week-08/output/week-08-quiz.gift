$CATEGORY: Week 8: High-Stakes Communication

::Executive Presence Framework::What distinguishes gravitas from appearance and communication in the Executive Presence Framework?
{
=Confidence and decisiveness under pressure, inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives, and demonstrated competence
~Physical appearance, commanding voice, and formal presentation skills
~Educational credentials, professional dress, and social status
~Popularity with colleagues, charisma, and public speaking ability
####Gravitas in the Executive Presence Framework comprises three core elements\: (1) <b>confidence</b> (self-assurance and composure), (2) <b>decisiveness</b> (making clear decisions under pressure), (3) <b>inclusiveness</b> (respecting diverse perspectives), and (4) <b>demonstrated competence</b> (proven capability through actions rather than credentials). The post-pandemic shift moved from <b>pedigree</b> (educational background and status) to demonstrated competence. See Week 8 slides 5-7.}

::Executive Presence Framework::What are the three elements of the Executive Presence Framework?
{
=Gravitas, Communication, and Appearance
~Confidence, Credibility, and Charisma
~Strategic thinking, relationship building, and emotional intelligence
~Technical expertise, soft skills, and interpersonal awareness
####The Executive Presence Framework comprises three elements\: (1) <b>Gravitas</b>—confidence and decisiveness under pressure, (2) <b>Communication</b>—superior speaking and <b>active listening</b> (genuinely understanding others), and (3) <b>Appearance</b>—<b>authenticity</b> (being genuine) and <b>digital presence</b> (professional image online). Post-pandemic research shows gravitas is most important (67% of executives), communication second, and appearance least important but requiring authenticity. See Week 8 slides 5-9.}

::Executive Presence Framework::How does "listen to learn" differ from "listen to respond" in the communication element of the Executive Presence Framework?
{
='Listen to learn' involves genuine curiosity and understanding; 'listen to respond' means waiting for your turn to speak while formulating your reply
~'Listen to learn' means staying silent; 'listen to respond' means asking questions
~'Listen to learn' is for one-on-one conversations; 'listen to respond' is for presentations
~'Listen to learn' requires note-taking; 'listen to respond' does not
####"Listen to learn" reflects <b>genuine curiosity</b> (sincere interest in understanding others' viewpoints) and <b>active engagement</b> (focused attention on understanding). "Listen to respond" means <b>passively</b> waiting for your turn while mentally preparing counter-arguments. Leaders practicing "listen to learn" build <b>psychological safety</b> (an environment where people feel safe contributing) and are perceived as more effective. This shift represents a move from <b>transactional</b> (exchange-focused) to <b>relational</b> (relationship-focused) communication. See Week 8 slide 8.}

::Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)::What are the three crisis clusters in Situational Crisis Communication Theory, and how do they differ in responsibility attribution?
{
=Victim (low responsibility), Accidental (moderate responsibility), Intentional/Preventable (high responsibility)
~Internal (high), Mixed (moderate), External (low)
~Minor (low), Moderate (medium), Major (high)
~Preventable, Unpredictable, and Predictable
####SCCT's three crisis clusters based on <b>stakeholder attribution</b> (how people assign responsibility)\: (1) <b>Victim</b> cluster—external attribution, low responsibility (natural disaster, product tampering); (2) <b>Accidental</b> cluster—mixed attribution, moderate responsibility (equipment malfunction, technical error); (3) <b>Intentional/Preventable</b> cluster—internal attribution, high responsibility (safety shortcuts, misconduct). <b>Attribution Theory</b> posits that stakeholders assign blame based on perceived causes. Matching response intensity to attribution level is critical. See Week 8 slide 13.}

::Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)::In SCCT, how do intensifying factors change the response strategy required for a crisis?
{
~Intensifying factors allow organizations to use less accommodative responses
=Intensifying factors escalate the required response level, requiring more accommodative and apologetic responses
~Intensifying factors determine which crisis cluster the crisis belongs to
~Intensifying factors only affect victim cluster crises
####<b>Intensifying factors</b>—prior <b>crisis history</b> (previous similar incidents) and <b>reputation</b> (stakeholder perception of organizational character)—escalate required response intensity across all crisis clusters. If an organization has experienced similar crises or has poor reputation, stakeholders attribute more responsibility, requiring more <b>accommodative</b> (apologetic, compensatory, and relationship-focused) responses. An organization with spotless reputation can use <b>diminishing</b> (excuse, justification) posture; one with crisis history must use <b>rebuilding</b> (compensation, apology) posture. See Week 8 slide 14.}

::Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)::What are the two components of the ethical base response in SCCT, and how do they work together?
{
=Instructing information (safety guidance) and adjusting information (expressing concern) address both practical and emotional stakeholder needs across all crisis types
~Instructing and adjusting information are only necessary for victim cluster crises
~Instructing information alone is sufficient; adjusting information is optional
~Adjusting information means taking full responsibility; instructing information means providing directions
####The ethical base response in SCCT combines two complementary components\: (1) <b>Instructing information</b>—practical, actionable guidance addressing stakeholder safety and welfare; (2) <b>Adjusting information</b>—<b>empathetic</b> (understanding and caring about feelings) communication expressing organizational concern. <b>Instructing</b> answers\: "What should I do?" <b>Adjusting</b> answers\: "Does the organization care about me?" Together they address both <b>cognitive</b> (thinking, practical) and <b>affective</b> (emotional, feeling) stakeholder needs. This foundation applies <b>universally</b> to all crisis types. See Week 8 slide 15.}

::Stone's Three Conversations Model::What are the three layers of conversation that occur simultaneously in every difficult conversation according to Stone's Three Conversations Model?
{
='What Happened?' conversation (facts and blame), Feelings conversation (emotions), and Identity conversation (self-concept concerns)
~Opening conversation, middle conversation, and closing conversation
~Verbal conversation, non-verbal conversation, and written communication
~My perspective, your perspective, and the objective truth
####Stone's Three Conversations Model identifies three <b>simultaneous</b> (happening at the same time) conversation layers in every difficult interaction\: (1) <b>'What Happened?' conversation</b>—<b>interpretations</b> (meanings assigned to events) and <b>attributions</b> (assigning blame); (2) <b>Feelings conversation</b>—<b>emotions</b> (affective responses) underlying the exchange; (3) <b>Identity conversation</b>—internal dialogue about <b>self-concept</b> (who we think we are) and <b>competence</b> (capability and adequacy). Most people focus only on facts; missing the feelings and identity layers creates escalation. See Week 8 slides 17-18.}

::Stone's Three Conversations Model::In the Three Conversations Model, what does the "And Stance" do in the "What Happened?" layer of difficult conversations?
{
=It recognizes both perspectives can be valid simultaneously, transforming dialogue from debate to mutual understanding
~It means accepting all blame without discussing the other person's perspective
~It merges two conflicting viewpoints into a compromise position
~It concludes discussions by stating both people are equally right
####The "And Stance" transforms the "What Happened?" conversation layer from <b>adversarial</b> (competing for who's right) to <b>collaborative</b> (seeking mutual understanding). It states\: "You see it this way AND I see it that way"—recognizing that both perspectives can be <b>valid</b> (reasonable and defensible) given different information or <b>interpretations</b> (ways of understanding events). This creates <b>psychological safety</b> (feeling safe to express viewpoints without fear of punishment) and shifts from <b>debate</b> (proving one position correct) to <b>learning</b> (understanding different perspectives). See Week 8 slide 19.}

::Stone's Three Conversations Model::Why does the Three Conversations Model recommend starting difficult conversations with "the Third Story" rather than with your version or their version?
{
=It provides a neutral, objective starting point that avoids blame and creates psychological safety for dialogue
~It proves that your perspective is the most accurate
~It forces both people to compromise on the actual facts
~It allows you to control the conversation narrative
####The "Third Story" technique starts difficult conversations from a <b>neutral, objective</b> description—how a mediator would describe the situation without bias. This shifts from <b>blame-oriented</b> (identifying who is wrong) to <b>learning-oriented</b> (understanding differences) conversations. It creates <b>psychological safety</b> by positioning both parties as collaborative rather than adversarial. Starting with "your version" triggers defensiveness in the other person; starting with "their version" feels dismissive to you. The Third Story avoids both <b>egocentric</b> (self-centered) perspectives, opening genuine dialogue. See Week 8 slide 20.}

::Q&A Framework::Why does the Q&A Framework place Acknowledge before Answer in its sequence?
{
=It shows respect for the questioner and provides 2-3 seconds of thinking time to compose a thoughtful response
~It allows you to dismiss the question before actually addressing it
~It requires you to agree with the questioner's underlying assumptions
~It means jumping immediately to your answer without thinking
####The Q&A Framework places Acknowledge first because it serves dual functions\: (1) <b>Relational</b>—demonstrates respect for the questioner, building <b>rapport</b> (positive relationship); (2) <b>Cognitive</b>—provides thinking time that enables <b>composed</b> (calm, thoughtful) responses rather than <b>reactive</b> (defensive, emotional) ones. Phrases like "That's an excellent question" accomplish both simultaneously. This front-loads the framework with relationship and composure. See Week 8 slide 22.}

::Q&A Framework::In the Q&A Framework, what are the two functions of the Acknowledge step?
{
=It shows respect for the questioner and buys 2-3 seconds of thinking time
~It dismisses the question as unimportant
~It means you are agreeing with the questioner's underlying assumptions
~It means providing your complete answer without pausing
####The Acknowledge step serves two critical functions\: (1) <b>Relational</b>—shows respect for the questioner and their input, building <b>rapport</b> (positive relationship) and <b>credibility</b> (trustworthiness); (2) <b>Cognitive</b>—provides 2-3 seconds of thinking time, enabling <b>composed</b> (calm, thoughtful) responses rather than <b>reactive</b> (defensive, emotional) ones. Phrases like "That's an excellent question" or "I appreciate you raising that" accomplish both. This step demonstrates <b>executive presence</b> and prevents the defensive reactions that damage credibility. See Week 8 slide 23.}

::Q&A Framework::In the Four-Step Q&A Framework, which step comes after Acknowledge?
{
=Clarify (step 2)
~Answer (step 3)
~Check (step 4)
~Respond (not in framework)
####The Four-Step Q&A Framework sequence is\: (1) <b>Acknowledge</b>—show respect and gain composure; (2) <b>Clarify</b>—ensure you understand what's being asked; (3) <b>Answer</b>—address the question substance directly; (4) <b>Check</b>—confirm the questioner's concern was addressed. The <b>sequential</b> (in order) arrangement is critical because acknowledging first establishes respect, and clarifying before answering prevents the common mistake of addressing the wrong question. See Week 8 slide 22.}
