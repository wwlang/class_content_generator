// Question 1: Executive Presence Elements
::Week 8 Q1 - Executive Presence Elements::According to Hewlett's (2024) updated Executive Presence Model, which element is considered MOST important by senior executives?{
=Gravitas - confidence, decisiveness, and inclusiveness#Correct! 67% of senior executives identify gravitas as the most important element of executive presence. Gravitas includes confidence, decisiveness, and—in the updated model—inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives.
~Appearance - authenticity and professional image#Appearance is actually the LEAST important of the three elements, though authenticity within appearance has become more valued.
~Communication - virtual presence and listening skills#Communication is the second most important element, including virtual presence and "listen to learn" orientation, but gravitas is ranked #1 by senior executives.
~Charisma - natural leadership ability#Charisma is not one of the three elements. Executive presence is learnable—you don't need innate charisma. The three elements are gravitas, communication, and appearance.

// Question 2: SCCT Crisis Clusters
::Week 8 Q2 - SCCT Crisis Clusters::Your company experiences a technical malfunction that causes a service interruption. No one intended for this to happen, but the equipment should have been maintained better. According to Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT), which crisis cluster does this represent?{
~Victim cluster - organization is victim of external forces#Victim cluster is for situations where the organization has minimal control, like natural disasters or external product tampering. This scenario involves internal maintenance issues.
=Accidental cluster - organization had some control but didn't intend harm#Correct! This is an accidental cluster crisis. The organization had some control (maintenance responsibility) but didn't intend the harm. Technical-error accidents fall into this moderate-responsibility category.
~Intentional/Preventable cluster - organization made choices that caused crisis#Intentional/Preventable cluster involves deliberate choices or human misconduct. While maintenance was inadequate, this wasn't a deliberate decision to cause harm.
~Misinformation cluster - crisis based on false information#"Misinformation cluster" is not one of SCCT's three crisis clusters. The Deny posture is used for misinformation situations specifically, but it's not a cluster category.
}

// Question 3: Crisis Response Matching
::Week 8 Q3 - Crisis Response Matching::According to SCCT, if your organization is the victim of a false rumor (misinformation), the appropriate response strategy is the Deny posture (denial, attack the accuser).{
TRUE#Correct! The Deny posture is ONLY appropriate for misinformation situations where false rumors are being spread. In these cases, denying the false information and possibly attacking the source of misinformation is the correct strategy. However, using Deny posture for any other crisis type creates severe credibility damage—it's critical to match response to crisis type correctly.
FALSE#Actually, this is true. Deny posture is the correct response for misinformation. The key warning from SCCT is to NEVER use Deny outside misinformation situations, but when rumors are genuinely false, denial is appropriate and necessary.

// Question 4: Three Conversations Model
::Week 8 Q4 - Three Conversations Model::The Three Conversations Model from Harvard Negotiation Project identifies three layers in every difficult conversation. Which of the following is NOT one of those three conversations?{
~The "What Happened?" Conversation - disagreements about facts and interpretations#The "What Happened?" Conversation is the first of the three layers, focusing on disputes about facts, interpretations, and blame.
~The Feelings Conversation - emotions underlying the exchange#The Feelings Conversation is the second layer, addressing the emotions (acknowledged or not) that underlie the exchange.
~The Identity Conversation - what this means for who we are#The Identity Conversation is the third layer, focusing on internal dialogue about what the situation means for our self-concept.
=The Resolution Conversation - agreeing on next steps#Correct! "Resolution Conversation" is not one of the three layers. The model identifies\: What Happened (facts/interpretations), Feelings (emotions), and Identity (self-concept). Resolution is a potential outcome, not a separate conversation layer.
}

// Question 5: Q&A Framework Application
::Week 8 Q5 - Q&A Framework Application::During your presentation Q&A, an audience member asks\: "Your market analysis seems incomplete. Why didn't you include competitor pricing data?" Which response demonstrates the Four-Step Q&A Framework most effectively?{
~"We did include it—it's on slide 12. Were you not paying attention?"#This is defensive and disrespectful. It violates the Acknowledge step (makes questioner feel dismissed) and doesn't actually address whether competitor pricing should have been included.
="That's a great question. Just to clarify, are you asking why we didn't show competitor pricing specifically, or why our pricing analysis overall seems incomplete? Our approach focused on value proposition rather than price competition, and here's why... Does that address your question?"#Correct! This response follows all four steps\: (1) Acknowledge - "great question," (2) Clarify - "are you asking about X or Y?", (3) Answer - explains the approach and reasoning, (4) Check - "Does that address your question?" It shows respect, prevents misunderstanding, provides substance, and confirms understanding.
~"I don't know. We probably should have included that."#While honest, this response lacks confidence and doesn't defend the analytical choices made. It also doesn't acknowledge the question positively or check understanding.
~"Competitor pricing wasn't relevant to our analysis."#Too abrupt and dismissive. It doesn't acknowledge the question respectfully, doesn't explain reasoning, and doesn't check if the answer satisfies the questioner.
}

// Question 6: Executive Communication Shift
::Week 8 Q6 - Executive Communication Shift::According to Hewlett's (2024) research comparing 2012 to 2022 data, "comfort on Zoom" and virtual presence skills have become essential components of the Communication element in executive presence.{
TRUE#Correct! The updated Executive Presence Model identifies "comfort on Zoom" as a new essential skill within the Communication element. Post-pandemic, virtual presence is now mandatory for leaders, not optional. This represents one of the most significant shifts in executive presence expectations over the past decade.
FALSE#Actually, this is true. Virtual presence is now a core component. Research shows that executives must master virtual communication (lighting, camera presence, engagement techniques) as thoroughly as in-person communication skills. The pandemic permanently changed what constitutes effective executive communication.
}

// Question 7: Difficult Conversations Technique
::Week 8 Q7 - Difficult Conversations Technique::Your teammate forgot to complete their section of the group presentation, and you're frustrated. According to the Three Conversations Model, which approach best demonstrates "The And Stance" from the "What Happened?" conversation?{
~"You forgot your section AND now we're all going to get a bad grade."#This uses the word "and" but isn't the And Stance—it's just listing consequences. It doesn't acknowledge both perspectives as potentially valid.
="From your perspective, something prevented you from finishing AND from my perspective, we had a clear deadline we all agreed to. Let's figure out what happened."#Correct! The "And Stance" means both perspectives can be valid simultaneously. This response acknowledges their reality ("something prevented you") AND your reality ("we had a deadline"), without making either person wrong. It opens dialogue rather than assigning blame.
~"You're irresponsible AND I'm the one who always has to fix things."#This is judgment and blame, not the And Stance. It makes the other person wrong ("irresponsible") and yourself a victim ("I always have to fix things").
~"I understand you were busy AND I'm not mad about it."#While this seems conciliatory, it doesn't actually explore both perspectives. It dismisses your own valid frustration rather than acknowledging that both realities can exist.
}

// Question 8: SCCT Ethical Base Response
::Week 8 Q8 - SCCT Ethical Base Response::According to Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT), ALL crisis responses—regardless of crisis type—must include two elements\: instructing information (safety guidance) and adjusting information (expressing concern).{
TRUE#Correct! SCCT identifies these as the "ethical base response" required for all crises, regardless of which crisis cluster or response posture is appropriate. Instructing information tells stakeholders what to do to protect themselves. Adjusting information expresses the organization's concern for stakeholders. These form the foundation; response postures (Deny, Diminish, Rebuild, Bolstering) are then added based on the crisis type.
FALSE#Actually, this is true. Even when using different response postures, instructing and adjusting information are always required. For example, even if you're using a Deny posture for misinformation, you still need to tell people what to do (instructing) and show concern for their wellbeing (adjusting). These are non-negotiable ethical requirements.
