## 70% of Leaders Consider Decisiveness a Component of Executive Presence

Yet decisiveness under pressure—in Q&A, crises, and difficult conversations—is what actually separates high performers from average ones.

(Hewlett, 2024)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome to Week 8 on High-Stakes Communication
- We've been building communication skills progressively—this week we tackle the hardest situations

**Key Points:**
- Executive presence isn't about looking polished—it's about performing under pressure
- 70% of senior executives identify decisiveness as a key component (Hewlett, 2024)
- Today we focus on three pressure situations: Q&A, difficult conversations, and crisis communication
- These are the moments where competent communicators reveal themselves as leaders

**Example:**
- Think about a recent situation where you felt pressured in communication—maybe a surprise question from a professor, a disagreement with a friend, or having to explain something that went wrong
- That feeling of stress is what we're going to learn to manage

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick poll: How many of you have experienced anxiety when someone asks an unexpected question during a presentation?"

**Transition:**
- Let's establish what we're trying to accomplish today

---

### Slide 2: Objectives
<!-- LAYOUT: objectives -->

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the Executive Presence Model (gravitas, communication, appearance) to high-stakes scenarios
2. **Evaluate** appropriate crisis response strategies using Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)
3. **Design** effective approaches to difficult conversations using the Three Conversations Model
4. **Demonstrate** techniques for handling challenging Q&A sessions with confidence

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Four measurable outcomes for today—these directly prepare you for your group presentations

**Key Points:**

### Slide 3: Assessment Connection
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## How This Prepares You for Week 12 Group Presentation

**Group Presentation (25%) + Individual Grade (15%) = 40% of your final mark**

| Assessment Component | Today's Skills |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Opening & delivery** | Executive presence (gravitas + communication) |
| **Q&A performance (10 min)** | Handling challenging questions under pressure |
| **Team dynamics** | Navigating difficult conversations during preparation |
| **Crisis management** | Responding if technology fails or questions blindside you |

**Your presentation includes a mandatory 10-minute Q&A—handling it professionally is graded.**

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Your Week 12 presentation is worth 40% of your final grade—nearly half
- Today's content directly prepares you for that assessment

**Key Points:**
- The presentation has a 10-minute Q&A session that is graded
- You'll be assessed on executive presence—how you carry yourself, communicate, and handle pressure
- Team dynamics during preparation require difficult conversation skills
- If something goes wrong (tech fails, tough question), crisis communication frameworks help

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: In Q&A, hierarchy matters. If a senior person asks a question, you need to balance showing respect with demonstrating expertise. Executive presence helps you navigate this.

**Check Understanding:**
- "How many of you have experienced a presentation where Q&A was harder than the presentation itself?"

**Transition:**
- Here's how we'll structure today's journey

## SEGMENT 1
# Executive Presence: The Three Elements

*What leaders develop to perform under pressure*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- We're starting with executive presence because it's the foundation for all high-stakes communication

**Key Points:**
- Executive presence is learnable—you don't need to be born with charisma
- Research by Sylvia Ann Hewlett shows it has three measurable components
- These components have shifted post-pandemic

**Example:**
- Think of someone you consider a strong leader—what makes them effective under pressure?

**Transition:**
- Let's define what executive presence actually is

---

#### Slide 6: Executive Presence Definition
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## What Is Executive Presence?

**Executive Presence (EP):** The ability to project mature self-confidence, inspire others, and remain effective under pressure.

### The Updated Executive Presence Model (Hewlett, 2024)

1. **GRAVITAS** (67% of senior executives say this is what really matters)
   - Confidence and decisiveness under pressure
   - Inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives
   - *Key shift:* Pedigree less important than demonstrated competence

2. **COMMUNICATION** (Second most important element)
   - Superior speaking skills, commanding presence
   - Virtual presence (Zoom comfort now essential)
   - "Listen to learn" orientation vs. "listen to respond"

3. **APPEARANCE** (Least important, most changed)
   - Authenticity now paramount over formality
   - Digital presence matters (online image)
   - Showing up in person signals commitment

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Hewlett's research compares 2012 to 2022 data—significant shifts due to pandemic

**Key Points:**
- Gravitas is #1: 67% of senior execs prioritize this
- Old model emphasized pedigree (which school you attended). New model emphasizes inclusiveness and respect
- Communication has added virtual presence—you must perform on Zoom as well as in person
- Appearance has shifted from "dress formally" to "be authentic"
- Critical insight: Sound of your voice matters **2x as much as content** (Hewlett, 2024)

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: "Gravitas" in Vietnamese culture might emphasize humility alongside confidence. Western EP emphasizes assertiveness; Vietnamese EP balances this with showing respect for hierarchy.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which of these three elements do you think you're strongest in? Which needs development?"

**Transition:**
- Let's look at each element in detail, starting with gravitas

---

#### Slide 7: Gravitas in Action
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Gravitas: Confidence + Inclusiveness

**Case Study: The Listening Tour Strategy**

**Context:** New CEO seeking to catalyze cultural change
**Action:** Asked every meeting: *"Tell me one thing you're experimenting with"*
**Result:** Employees shifted behavior to prepare better answers
**Lesson:** Questions can catalyze change as powerfully as directives

(McKinsey, 2025)

### Gravitas Tactics
- Show mastery through deep subject matter knowledge
- Demonstrate decisiveness in high-pressure moments
- Practice inclusiveness through authentic engagement with diverse perspectives

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Gravitas isn't about dominating conversations—it's about confidence combined with respect

**Key Points:**
- This CEO case shows gravitas through strategic questions, not commands
- The question "What are you experimenting with?" signals openness to innovation
- Vietnamese context: Asking "What are you experimenting with?" shows respect for employee expertise while maintaining authority
- Gravitas = confidence without arrogance

**Example:**
- In your presentations, gravitas shows when you answer a tough question with: "That's an excellent question. Let me address that by..." (shows respect + confidence)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Pair-share (2 min): Think of a leader you respect. How do they show gravitas?"

**Transition:**
- Gravitas is what you project. Communication is how you deliver.

---

#### Slide 8: Communication Element
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Communication: Virtual + Listening

**Post-Pandemic Additions to Communication Element:**

| Traditional Skill | New Essential Skill |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Command a room in person | **Comfort on Zoom** - virtual presence is now mandatory |
| Superior speaking skills | **"Listen to learn"** orientation - active listening signals leadership |
| Assertive message delivery | **Authenticity** - genuine communication over performed leadership |

**Key Stat:** CEOs spend **30% of their time** with external stakeholders—communication is continuous, not episodic
(McKinsey, 2025)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Communication has always been important, but what constitutes effective communication has changed

**Key Points:**
- Virtual presence is now non-negotiable: lighting, camera angle, engagement techniques matter
- "Listen to learn" vs. "listen to respond": Leaders who actively listen are seen as more effective
- Authenticity beats polish: People value genuine communication over scripted corporate-speak
- 30% of CEO time is stakeholder-facing—communication is constant

**Example:**
- In Zoom meetings: Camera at eye level (not looking down), good lighting, minimize distractions in background. These signal professionalism.
- Vietnamese context: In virtual meetings, showing respect through attentive listening is even more important when you can't use physical presence cues

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick reflection: What's one thing you could improve about your virtual presence?"

**Transition:**
- The third element is appearance—but not what you think

---

#### Slide 9: Appearance Element
<!-- LAYOUT: comparison -->

## Appearance: From Formal to Authentic

| Old Rules (Pre-2020) | New Rules (2024) |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Dress formally at all times | Dress for "new normal" (authenticity over formality) |
| Physical presence = commitment | **Show up in person when possible** (still signals commitment) |
| Minimize personal brand | **Build online image** (digital presence matters) |
| Follow dress code rigidly | Authenticity is paramount |

**Key Insight:** Appearance is now the **least important** of the three elements, but authenticity is the **most important** sub-component
(Hewlett, 2024)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Biggest shift in EP research: appearance matters less, but authenticity matters more

**Key Points:**
- Don't ignore appearance—but prioritize being genuine over being perfectly polished
- Online image (LinkedIn, social media) now part of "appearance"
- Showing up in person still matters—demonstrates investment in relationships
- For presentations: Dress appropriately, but focus more on gravitas and communication

**Example:**
- Case: Sheryl Sandberg used LinkedIn strategically to build executive brand—online presence complements traditional presence
- Vietnamese context: Balance traditional respect for formal dress with authenticity. Business casual is increasingly acceptable in startups; corporate settings still value formality.

**Check Understanding:**
- "How many of you have a professional LinkedIn profile? That's part of modern executive appearance."

**Transition:**
- Now let's see executive presence in the highest-stakes context: CEO communication

---

#### Slide 10: CEO Communication Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## The EDGE Framework for Executive Communications

Based on 80+ CEO interviews (McKinsey, 2025)

| Element | Focus | Application to You |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| **E – Expanded** | Communicate to multiple stakeholder groups | Your presentation addresses faculty, peers, and guests |
| **D – Distinctive** | Develop personal narrative ("The Four W's") | Your unique perspective and story |
| **G – Growth-oriented** | Empower multiple voices | Team presentations require coordination |
| **E – Engaged** | Maintain consistent rhythm | Rehearsal consistency, not last-minute prep |

**The Four W's Narrative Structure:**
1. **Who you are** – Identity, values (authenticity)
2. **Why you are here** – Purpose, mission (motivation)
3. **What you will achieve** – Agenda with accountability (vision)
4. **When you will execute** – Timeline and immediate actions (urgency)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This framework comes from studying CEOs at highest performance level—Fortune 100 companies

**Key Points:**
- EDGE shows communication at the executive level is strategic, not spontaneous
- The Four W's create memorable narratives: who, why, what, when
- For your presentations: Open with who you are (team intro), why this topic matters, what you'll cover, when/how you'll deliver it
- Distinctive language creates lasting impact: Find 1-2 phrases that capture your message

**Example:**
- Satya Nadella (Microsoft) created "learn it all" vs. "know it all" concept—proprietary language that became cultural shorthand
- For your presentation: Can you create one memorable phrase that captures your core message?

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think about your presentation topic: What's your 'why you are here'? Why does your topic matter?"

**Transition:**
- We've covered executive presence. Now let's apply it to crisis situations.

### SEGMENT 2: Crisis Communication Fundamentals (6 slides)

#### Slide 11: Section Break
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## SEGMENT 2
# Crisis Communication Fundamentals

*Responding strategically when stakes are highest*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Shifting from individual presence to organizational-level communication
- Crises are the ultimate high-stakes situation

**Key Points:**
- Crisis communication isn't about panic—it's about systematic response
- We'll learn SCCT: Situational Crisis Communication Theory
- This is the most-cited framework in crisis communication research (2,044+ citations)

**Example:**
- Crisis in your context: Technology failure during presentation, unexpected challenging question, team member doesn't show up

**Transition:**
- Let's define what makes something a crisis

---

#### Slide 12: What Is a Crisis?
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)

**Definition:** A prescriptive framework that matches crisis response strategies to crisis types based on stakeholder attribution of organizational responsibility
(Coombs, 2007)

### Core Mechanism
- **Attribution Theory:** Stakeholders assess whether crises resulted from *situational* (external) or *organizational* (internal) factors
- **Key Insight:** Attribution of responsibility drives emotional and behavioral responses
- **Application:** Match response intensity to perceived responsibility level

**Foundation:** SCCT is the first empirically-tested, evidence-based crisis communication theory—not just case studies, but experimental validation

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- SCCT gives you a decision framework when you're under pressure
- Unlike vague "be transparent" advice, SCCT tells you exactly what to do

**Key Points:**
- Attribution Theory: People naturally assign blame. Is the crisis your fault (internal) or bad luck (external)?
- Example: Natural disaster = external. Product defect = internal.
- Your response must match the level of responsibility stakeholders attribute to you
- 2,044+ academic citations makes this the gold standard

**Example:**
- Vietnamese business context: When something goes wrong, cultural tendency is to protect face. SCCT helps you balance saving face with taking appropriate responsibility.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick pair-share: Think of a recent organizational failure (airline delay, product recall). Was it perceived as internal or external fault?"

**Transition:**
- Let's see how SCCT categorizes different crisis types

---

#### Slide 13: Crisis Type Clusters
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Three Crisis Clusters Based on Responsibility

| Cluster | Responsibility Level | Examples |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **VICTIM** | Low (external attribution) | Natural disasters, rumors, workplace violence, product tampering (external) |
| **ACCIDENTAL** | Moderate (mixed attribution) | Technical-error accidents, stakeholder challenges, technical product harm |
| **INTENTIONAL/PREVENTABLE** | High (internal attribution) | Human-error accidents, organizational misdeed, management misconduct |

**Critical Rule:** Crisis history and prior reputation act as **"intensifying factors"** that escalate required response level

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- SCCT categorizes every crisis into one of three clusters based on perceived responsibility

**Key Points:**
- Victim cluster: Organization is seen as victim (e.g., terrorist attack). Low responsibility.
- Accidental cluster: Organization had some control but didn't intend harm (e.g., equipment malfunction). Moderate responsibility.
- Intentional/Preventable cluster: Organization caused the crisis through choices (e.g., safety shortcuts). High responsibility.
- Intensifying factors: If you've had crises before or have bad reputation, stakeholders assign MORE responsibility

**Example:**
- Tylenol poisonings (1982): External tampering = Victim cluster. Johnson & Johnson responded with full transparency and product recall—became case study in crisis response.
- Vietnamese context: If a company has prior reputation issues, even a minor problem can be seen as intentional/preventable.

**Check Understanding:**
- "If your presentation technology fails, which cluster is that? (Accidental—mixed attribution)"

**Transition:**
- Now that we know the clusters, how do we respond?

---

#### Slide 14: Crisis Response Strategies
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Four Crisis Response Postures

| Posture | Strategies | Best For | Risk |
|---------|-----------|----------|------|
| **DENY** | Attack accuser, denial, scapegoating | Misinformation situations ONLY | Severe credibility damage if misapplied |
| **DIMINISH** | Excuse, justification | Accidental cluster crises | Insufficient for intentional crises |
| **REBUILD** | Compensation, full apology | Intentional/preventable crises | Expensive, admits fault |
| **BOLSTERING** | Remind of past good works, ingratiation | Supplementary strategy only | Cannot stand alone |

**Matching Rule:** Higher perceived responsibility requires more accommodative responses

**Ethical Base Response for ALL Crises:**
- Instructing information (safety guidance)
- Adjusting information (expressing concern)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Four response postures, each matched to crisis type
- Critical warning: NEVER use denial outside misinformation situations

**Key Points:**
- Deny posture: Only for false rumors. Example: "We did NOT use contaminated ingredients" (when rumor is false)
- Diminish posture: For accidental crises. Example: "Equipment malfunctioned despite regular maintenance"
- Rebuild posture: For intentional crises. Full apology + compensation. Example: "We made a mistake and here's how we'll make it right"
- Bolstering: Add-on only. "Remember our 20-year safety record" helps but can't be your only response
- ALL crises need instructing info (what to do) and adjusting info (we care about you)

**Example:**
- Exxon Valdez (1989): Intentional/preventable crisis (human error) but used diminish posture (excuses). Result: Reputational disaster.
- AT&T service interruption: Accidental crisis, used rebuild posture (full apology + compensation). Success.

**Check Understanding:**
- "What response posture would you use if your team forgot to include required content in presentation? (Rebuild—take responsibility, explain fix)"

**Transition:**
- Let's see this framework in action with a case study

---

#### Slide 15: Crisis Case Study
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Case Study: David Ellison (Paramount CEO)

**Context:** New CEO writing first stakeholder communication
**Crisis Potential:** Media industry in turmoil, stakeholder skepticism

**Action:** Wrote CEO letter positioning sports as "powerful engine for audience engagement"
**Timeline:** Less than one week later, secured **$7.7 billion UFC media rights deal**
**Outcome:** Words aligned with action—built immediate credibility

**Lesson:** "Show and tell"—your crisis response must be backed by tangible action
(McKinsey, 2025)

### Application to Your Presentations
- If something goes wrong, acknowledge it immediately (adjusting information)
- Explain what you're doing about it (instructing information)
- Follow through with action (show, don't just tell)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This case shows crisis communication principles applied proactively

**Key Points:**
- Ellison faced potential credibility crisis as new CEO in struggling industry
- He made a bold claim (sports = engagement engine) and immediately backed it with $7.7B deal
- This is "show and tell" principle: words must align with actions
- In your presentation: If tech fails, don't just apologize—show how you'll adapt (use whiteboard, handouts, verbal description)

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: "Show and tell" aligns with cultural value of demonstrated competence over self-promotion. Don't just say you'll fix it—show the fix.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Pair-share (2 min): What's one crisis that could happen in your presentation? How would you respond using SCCT principles?"

**Transition:**
- We've covered organizational crisis communication. Now let's go to interpersonal level: difficult conversations.

---

#### Slide 16: Key Quote on Crisis Communication
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

> "Nothing prepares you for becoming the face of a company. Nothing."
>
> **— Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz**

> "I have a BA in English Literature, a minor in Computer Science, a JD, and an MBA. As CEO of Cloudflare, a fairly technical company, the most important has always been that English Literature degree."
>
> **— Matt Prince, CEO of Cloudflare**

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Two CEO quotes that emphasize communication as the #1 executive skill

**Key Points:**
- Bäte's quote: Even experienced executives feel unprepared for crisis communication stakes
- Prince's quote: Communication skills matter more than technical expertise at leadership level
- For you: Communication competence is your most transferable, valuable skill

**Example:**
- Technical skills (Python, Excel, etc.) get you in the door. Communication skills (presenting, handling pressure) get you promoted.

**Check Understanding:**
- "What surprises you about Prince's statement that English Literature matters more than technical skills?"

**Transition:**
- Now let's tackle the most common high-stakes situation: difficult conversations

---

### SEGMENT 3: Difficult Conversations & Q&A Mastery (6 slides)

#### Slide 17: Section Break
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## SEGMENT 3
# Difficult Conversations & Q&A Mastery

*Navigating interpersonal pressure with grace*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Moving from organizational (crisis) to interpersonal (difficult conversations)
- This is where most communication pressure happens in daily life

**Key Points:**
- Difficult conversations: Delivering bad news, disagreeing with authority, addressing conflict
- Q&A sessions: Responding to challenging questions without defensiveness
- Both require emotional regulation and structured approach

**Example:**
- Difficult conversations in student context: Asking professor for grade review, addressing teammate who isn't contributing, negotiating deadline extension

**Transition:**
- Let's start with the most comprehensive framework for difficult conversations

---

#### Slide 18: The Three Conversations Model
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## The Three Conversations Model (Harvard Negotiation Project)

**Core Insight:** Every difficult conversation contains three separate conversations happening simultaneously
(Stone, Patton, & Heen, 2023)

### The Three Layers

**1. The "What Happened?" Conversation**
- Focus: Disagreements about facts, interpretations, blame
- **Common Mistake:** Assuming certainty about what happened
- **Key Technique:** "The And Stance"—both perspectives can be valid simultaneously
- **Critical Insight:** Separate intent from impact—never assume you know why someone acted

**2. The Feelings Conversation**
- Focus: Emotions underlying the exchange (acknowledged or not)
- **Common Mistake:** Ignoring or venting emotions
- **Key Technique:** Describe feelings rather than express them reactively

**3. The Identity Conversation**
- Focus: Internal dialogue about what this means for who we are
- **Common Mistake:** All-or-nothing identity thinking
- **Key Technique:** Accept your own complexity

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This framework is from the creators of *Getting to Yes*—Harvard's premier negotiation research

**Key Points:**
- Every difficult conversation has three layers happening at once
- "What Happened" layer: Facts are often in dispute. Use "And Stance": "You see it this way AND I see it this way" (both valid)
- Feelings layer: Emotions are real even if facts are disputed. Name feelings: "I feel frustrated" vs. "You're making me angry"
- Identity layer: "Am I competent/good/lovable?" Questions like this get triggered. Remind yourself: one mistake doesn't define you
- Vietnamese context: "Face" relates to identity conversation—threats to face trigger defensive reactions

**Example:**
- Group presentation scenario: Team member didn't finish their slides.
  - What Happened: They say they emailed you; you say you never got it. Both might be true (spam filter?).
  - Feelings: You're frustrated; they're embarrassed.
  - Identity: "Am I a good team member?" (for both of you)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which layer do you think is hardest to manage in difficult conversations? (Poll the room)"

**Transition:**
- Here's how to apply this model in practice

---

#### Slide 19: The Learning Conversation Approach
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Transforming Difficult Conversations into Learning Conversations

### Starting Point: The "Third Story"
Begin from how a neutral observer would describe the situation (not your version or their version)

### Core Techniques
1. **Use inquiry, paraphrasing, and acknowledgment**
   - "Help me understand your perspective..."
   - "What I'm hearing is... Is that right?"

2. **"Tempered speech" vs. exaggeration**
   - "I felt surprised when..." (not "You ALWAYS do this")

3. **Share perspective AS perspective, not absolute truth**
   - "From my perspective..." (not "The truth is...")

**Goal:** Transform difficult conversation into learning conversation

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Practical application of the Three Conversations Model
- Key shift: From debate (who's right) to learning (what can we understand)

**Key Points:**
- "Third Story": Imagine a mediator describing the situation. Start there, not with blame.
- Inquiry before advocacy: Ask questions before defending your position
- Paraphrasing: "What I hear you saying is..." builds understanding
- Tempered speech: Avoid "always/never." Use specific examples.
- Vietnamese context: Indirect communication is cultural norm. "From my perspective" aligns with cultural preference for non-confrontational language.

**Example:**
- Bad approach: "You never finish your work on time and I always have to cover for you!"
- Learning approach: "I've noticed our timelines have been tight. Can we talk about how to coordinate better? From my perspective, when deadlines shift, I feel stressed. How are you experiencing this?"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Pair-share (2 min): Practice starting a difficult conversation with 'Third Story.' Scenario: Teammate missed a deadline."

**Transition:**
- Now let's apply these principles to Q&A sessions

---

#### Slide 20: Handling Challenging Q&A
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Mastering Q&A Sessions Without Defensiveness

### Four-Step Q&A Framework

**1. ACKNOWLEDGE the question**
- "That's an excellent question"
- "I appreciate you raising that"
- Shows respect, buys thinking time

**2. CLARIFY if needed**
- "Just to make sure I understand, are you asking about X or Y?"
- Prevents answering the wrong question

**3. ANSWER directly**
- Address the question asked, not the question you wish they'd asked
- If you don't know: "I don't have that data, but I can find out"

**4. CHECK understanding**
- "Does that address your question?"
- Opens dialogue, prevents assumptions

### Handling Hostile Questions
- Use Three Conversations Model: Separate intent from impact
- Assume positive intent: "They're testing my knowledge, not attacking me"
- Stay calm: Pause, breathe, respond (don't react)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Q&A is where executive presence gets tested most directly
- Four-step framework gives you structure when you're stressed

**Key Points:**
- Step 1 (Acknowledge): Buys you 2-3 seconds to think while showing respect
- Step 2 (Clarify): Prevents misunderstandings. Also shows you're listening carefully.
- Step 3 (Answer): Be direct. If you don't know, say so—then offer to find out
- Step 4 (Check): Confirms they're satisfied; shows you care about understanding
- Hostile questions: Assume they're testing knowledge, not attacking character (Three Conversations: separate intent from impact)

**Example:**
- Hostile question: "Your data looks questionable. How do we know this is accurate?"
- Bad response: "Are you saying I'm lying?" (defensive)
- Good response: "Great question—let me walk you through our methodology..." (acknowledge + answer)

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's the hardest part of Q&A for you? Thinking on your feet, or staying calm?"

**Transition:**
- Let's see Q&A techniques applied in a case study

---

#### Slide 21: Q&A Case Study
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Case Study: Handling Surprise Questions

**Scenario:** Student presenting marketing plan; professor asks: "Why didn't you consider influencer marketing? That's the obvious strategy for Gen Z."

### Poor Response (Defensive)
"We did consider it! It's just not in the slides because we ran out of time."
- Defensive tone, makes excuses, sounds unprepared

### Strong Response (Executive Presence)
"Excellent question—influencer marketing is highly relevant for Gen Z. We evaluated it and chose not to prioritize it for two reasons: budget constraints and timeline. However, I'd be happy to discuss how we'd incorporate it in Phase 2. Would that be helpful?"

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges question (shows respect)
- Answers directly (transparency)
- Provides reasoning (demonstrates thought process)
- Offers to continue dialogue (engagement)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Real scenario that happens frequently in presentations
- Watch how word choice and structure create different impressions

**Key Points:**
- Poor response problems: Sounds defensive, makes excuses, doesn't address the question substance
- Strong response elements: Acknowledges ("excellent question"), answers directly ("we evaluated it"), explains reasoning ("budget + timeline"), offers engagement ("Phase 2")
- Tone matters: "Excellent question" (curious, respectful) vs. "We already thought of that" (defensive)

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Direct disagreement with professor/authority figure can be face-threatening. "Excellent question" shows respect while still defending your work.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Notice the strong response doesn't apologize or make excuses—it explains reasoning. Why is that more effective?"

**Transition:**
- One more technique for really tough questions

---

#### Slide 22: Advanced Q&A Techniques
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Advanced Techniques for Really Tough Questions

### The "Bridge" Technique
When question is off-topic or unanswerable, bridge to what you CAN discuss

**Example:**
- **Question:** "What's your company's revenue projection for 2030?"
- **Bridge:** "While I don't have 2030 projections, what I can share is our current growth trajectory and the market factors that will influence long-term performance..."

### The "Parking Lot" Technique
When question deserves deep discussion but time is limited

**Example:**
- **Response:** "That's a complex question that deserves more than a quick answer. Can we add that to the parking lot and discuss it in detail after the presentation?"

### The "Turn It Back" Technique
When question is really an opinion disguised as a question

**Example:**
- **Question:** "Don't you think email marketing is dead?"
- **Response:** "That's an interesting perspective. What makes you think that?" (Then address after hearing their reasoning)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Three advanced techniques for when basic framework isn't enough

**Key Points:**
- Bridge: Redirect to related topic you CAN address. Don't fake knowledge you don't have.
- Parking Lot: Shows you value the question but need more time. Must actually follow up later.
- Turn It Back: When someone is really making a statement, not asking a question. Engage their reasoning first.
- Vietnamese context: "Turn It Back" can feel confrontational. Use softening language: "I'd be curious to hear more about your perspective on that..."

**Example:**
- Bridge example: "I don't have exact figures, but what I can share is the methodology we'd use to develop projections..."
- Parking Lot: Must visibly write it down or designate someone to track it

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which technique would you use if someone asks about a competitor you don't know much about? (Bridge to what you DO know about market dynamics)"

**Transition:**
- Let's bring all these frameworks together

## SEGMENT 4
# Integration & Application

*Bringing it all together for your presentations*

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- We've covered three major frameworks: Executive Presence, SCCT, Three Conversations Model
- Now let's integrate them for your Week 12 presentations

**Key Points:**
- You won't face organizational crises, but you will face pressure
- These frameworks give you tools for different pressure situations
- Practice them in tutorial today

**Transition:**
- Here's how the frameworks work together

---

#### Slide 24: Framework Integration
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## How the Frameworks Work Together

| Pressure Situation | Framework to Apply | Key Action |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Building overall credibility** | Executive Presence Model | Focus on gravitas (confidence + respect) and communication (virtual + listening) |
| **Something goes wrong** | SCCT Crisis Response | Match response to responsibility level: acknowledge (adjusting info) + explain fix (instructing info) |
| **Team conflict during prep** | Three Conversations Model | Use "Third Story" + separate intent from impact |
| **Challenging Q&A question** | Four-Step Q&A Framework | Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check |

**Integration Principle:** All frameworks share common foundation—stay calm, show respect, respond (don't react)

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Cheat sheet for which framework to use when
- Notice the common thread: emotional regulation + respect

**Key Points:**
- Executive Presence: Your baseline for all communication
- SCCT: When organizational-level problem occurs (tech failure, missing team member)
- Three Conversations: When interpersonal conflict arises (teammate disagreement)
- Q&A Framework: When facing challenging questions
- All require: Pause before responding, assume positive intent, show respect

**Example:**
- Real scenario: Team member doesn't show up for presentation.
  - SCCT: Acknowledge situation ("We're one person short due to illness"), explain adaptation ("We've redistributed content")
  - Executive Presence: Maintain gravitas (confidence despite problem)
  - If Q&A asks why someone's missing: Four-Step Framework

**Check Understanding:**
- "Can you see how these frameworks layer on each other rather than contradict?"

**Transition:**
- Let's see full integration in a comprehensive case

---

#### Slide 25: Comprehensive Case Study
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Comprehensive Case: The Perfect Storm

**Scenario:** Your team is presenting on sustainable business practices.

**Crisis 1:** Technology fails—slides won't display
- **Framework:** SCCT (accidental cluster)
- **Response:** "We're experiencing a technical issue. While we troubleshoot, let me walk you through our key findings verbally..." (adjusting info + instructing info)
- **Executive Presence:** Maintain gravitas—stay calm, be decisive

**Crisis 2:** During Q&A, audience member aggressively challenges your data
- **Framework:** Four-Step Q&A + Three Conversations Model
- **Response:** "Thank you for that question (acknowledge). Just to clarify, are you questioning our data sources or our interpretation? (clarify). Our data comes from [source], and here's our methodology... (answer). Does that address your concern? (check)"
- **Mindset:** Separate intent from impact—they're testing rigor, not attacking you personally

**Crisis 3:** After presentation, teammate blames you for tech failure
- **Framework:** Three Conversations Model
- **Response:** "I know we're both frustrated. From my perspective, the tech failure was unexpected—I tested everything yesterday. I'm guessing you're concerned about how it affected our grade? Can we talk about what we can learn from this?"

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- This scenario combines all three pressure situations in one presentation
- Notice how different frameworks apply to different moments

**Key Points:**
- Tech failure = SCCT: Acknowledge problem, explain solution, maintain executive presence
- Aggressive Q&A = Four-Step + Three Conversations: Acknowledge question, don't take it personally, answer substance
- Team conflict = Three Conversations: Third Story ("we're both frustrated"), separate intent from impact
- Throughout all: Executive presence maintains your credibility

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Tech failure can feel face-threatening. SCCT lets you acknowledge without losing credibility.
- Aggressive questions from authority figure: Extra challenging in hierarchical culture. "Thank you for that question" shows respect while defending work.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Pair-share (3 min): Walk through this scenario with a partner. How would you specifically respond at each crisis point?"

**Transition:**
- Let's wrap up with key takeaways

## Wrap-up (4 slides)

#### Slide 26: Key Takeaways
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Key Takeaways: High-Stakes Communication

**1. Executive Presence is Learnable**
- Focus on gravitas (confidence + inclusiveness), communication (virtual + listening), and authentic appearance
- Sound of voice matters 2x as much as content

**2. Match Crisis Response to Responsibility Level**
- SCCT provides structure: Victim → Diminish, Accidental → Diminish, Intentional → Rebuild
- Always provide adjusting information (concern) + instructing information (action)

**3. Difficult Conversations Have Three Layers**
- What Happened (facts), Feelings (emotions), Identity (self-concept)
- Use "Third Story" and separate intent from impact

**4. Q&A Framework: Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check**
- Assume positive intent, stay calm, respond (don't react)

**5. All Frameworks Share Foundation: Emotional Regulation + Respect**

#### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Five core takeaways that summarize today's lecture
- These apply far beyond presentations—job interviews, client meetings, leadership roles

**Key Points:**
- EP is learnable: Practice gravitas, communication, appearance elements
- SCCT: Don't panic—match response to crisis type
- Three Conversations: Recognize the layers, especially feelings and identity
- Q&A: Structure helps when you're stressed
- Common thread: Stay calm, show respect

**Example:**
- These frameworks will serve you for decades. CEOs use them, startup founders use them, managers use them.

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which framework do you think you'll use first? In what situation?"

**Transition:**
- Let's preview your tutorial activity
