# 70%

**of executives identify decisiveness as a key component of executive presence**

But it's decisiveness **under pressure** that separates high performers from average ones.

*(Hewlett, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
Executive presence isn't about looking polished in comfortable situations—it's about performing under pressure when the stakes are high. Hewlett's 2024 research shows 70% of senior executives identify decisiveness as key to executive presence, but specifically decisiveness under pressure matters most.

Today we focus on three pressure situations: Q&A sessions, difficult conversations, and crisis communication. These are the moments that test your communication competence.

Quick poll: How many of you have experienced anxiety when someone asks an unexpected question during a presentation? This is common, which is why today's frameworks are valuable.

<slide number="3" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the Executive Presence Model (gravitas, communication, appearance) to high-stakes scenarios
2. **Evaluate** appropriate crisis response strategies using Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)
3. **Design** effective approaches to difficult conversations using the Three Conversations Model
4. **Demonstrate** techniques for handling challenging Q&A sessions with confidence

<speaker-notes>
Four measurable outcomes directly preparing you for your group presentations.

Objective 1: Executive Presence Model identifies three learnable elements—gravitas, communication, and appearance.

Objective 2: SCCT (Situational Crisis Communication Theory) is a research-backed framework for organizational crisis response developed by W. Timothy Coombs.

Objective 3: Three Conversations Model from Harvard's Negotiation Project handles interpersonal conflict.

Objective 4: Practical Q&A techniques for your Week 12 presentations.

Notice we focus on frameworks rather than tips. Frameworks provide structure when you're stressed—they guide decision-making when emotional regulation is challenged.

## How This Prepares You for Week 12 Group Presentation

**Group Presentation (25%) + Individual Grade (15%) = 40% of your final mark**

| Assessment Component | Today's Skills |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Opening & delivery | Executive presence (gravitas + communication) |
| Q&A performance (10 min) | Handling challenging questions under pressure |
| Team dynamics | Navigating difficult conversations during preparation |
| Crisis management | Responding if technology fails or questions blindside you |

**Your presentation includes a mandatory 10-minute Q&A—handling it professionally is graded.**

<speaker-notes>
Your Week 12 presentation is worth 40% of your final grade. Today's content directly prepares you for that assessment.

The presentation has a mandatory 10-minute Q&A session explicitly graded as part of your performance. You'll be assessed on executive presence—how you carry yourself, communicate under pressure, and handle unexpected challenges.

Team dynamics during preparation will require difficult conversation skills when coordinating across different work styles. If something goes wrong—technology fails, tough question, team member struggles—crisis communication frameworks help you respond professionally.

In Vietnamese context, Q&A sessions involve additional complexity because hierarchy matters. If a senior person asks a question, you must balance showing respect with demonstrating expertise. Executive presence helps you navigate this cultural dimension while maintaining credibility.

# SEGMENT 1

## Executive Presence: The Three Elements

*What leaders develop to perform under pressure*

<speaker-notes>
We start with executive presence because it's the foundation for all high-stakes communication. Many people think executive presence is innate—something you're born with. Research by Sylvia Ann Hewlett demonstrates that executive presence is actually learnable with three measurable components you can develop systematically.

These components have shifted significantly post-pandemic. Hewlett compared data from 2012 to 2022 and found substantial changes in what senior executives value.

Think of someone you consider a strong leader—what makes them effective under pressure? Chances are, they demonstrate these three elements we're about to explore.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Executive Presence Definition">

## What Is Executive Presence?

**Executive Presence (EP):** The ability to project mature self-confidence, inspire others, and remain effective under pressure.

### The Updated Executive Presence Model (Hewlett, 2024)

**1. GRAVITAS** *(67% of senior executives say this is what really matters)*
- Confidence and decisiveness under pressure
- Inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives
- **Key shift:** Pedigree less important than demonstrated competence

**2. COMMUNICATION** *(Second most important element)*
- Superior speaking skills, commanding presence
- Virtual presence (Zoom comfort now essential)
- "Listen to learn" orientation vs. "listen to respond"

**3. APPEARANCE** *(Least important, most changed)*
- Authenticity now paramount over formality
- Digital presence matters (online image)
- Showing up in person signals commitment

<speaker-notes>
Hewlett's research compares 2012 to 2022 data, revealing significant shifts due to pandemic and changing workplace norms.

Gravitas is the number one factor: 67% of senior executives prioritize this above all else. The old model emphasized pedigree—which school you attended, who you know. The new model emphasizes inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives. Demonstrated competence matters more than credentials.

Communication has added virtual presence as core requirement. You must perform effectively on Zoom as well as in person. The sound of your voice matters twice as much as the content of what you say—a critical insight from Hewlett's research. "Listen to learn" means actively seeking understanding rather than waiting for your turn to speak.

Appearance has shifted dramatically from "dress formally at all times" to "be authentic." Authenticity is now paramount. This doesn't mean appearance doesn't matter—it means genuine presentation trumps performed formality. Your online image (LinkedIn, professional social media) is now part of "appearance."

In Vietnamese context, "gravitas" might emphasize humility alongside confidence. Western executive presence emphasizes assertiveness; Vietnamese executive presence balances this with showing respect for hierarchy.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="content" title="Gravitas in Action">

## Gravitas: Confidence + Inclusiveness

### Case Study: The Listening Tour Strategy

**Context:** New CEO seeking to catalyze cultural change

**Action:** Asked every meeting: *"Tell me one thing you're experimenting with"*

**Result:** Employees shifted behavior to prepare better answers

**Lesson:** Questions can catalyze change as powerfully as directives

*(McKinsey, 2025)*

### Gravitas Tactics

- Show mastery through deep subject matter knowledge
- Demonstrate decisiveness in high-pressure moments
- Practice inclusiveness through authentic engagement with diverse perspectives

<speaker-notes>
Gravitas isn't about dominating conversations or asserting authority through volume. It's about projecting confidence combined with respect for others.

This CEO case study shows gravitas through strategic questions rather than commands. The question "What are you experimenting with?" signals several things: openness to innovation, confidence that employees have good ideas, and expectation of proactive initiative. Employees responded by actually experimenting more because they knew they'd be asked.

In Vietnamese context, asking "What are you experimenting with?" shows respect for employee expertise while maintaining authority. It's culturally appropriate because it invites contribution without challenging hierarchy.

In your presentations, gravitas shows when you answer a tough question with: "That's an excellent question. Let me address that by..." This demonstrates respect for the questioner and confidence in your ability to respond. It buys you thinking time while maintaining executive presence.

Pair-share for two minutes: Think of a leader you respect. How do they show gravitas? What specific behaviors demonstrate confidence combined with inclusiveness?
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Communication Element">

## Communication: Virtual + Listening

### Post-Pandemic Additions to Communication Element:

| Traditional Skill | New Essential Skill |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Command a room in person | Comfort on Zoom - virtual presence now mandatory |
| Superior speaking skills | "Listen to learn" orientation - active listening signals leadership |
| Assertive message delivery | Authenticity - genuine communication over performed leadership |

**Key stat:** CEOs spend 30% of their time with external stakeholders—communication is continuous, not episodic *(McKinsey, 2025)*

<speaker-notes>
Communication has always been important for leaders, but what constitutes effective communication has changed substantially.

Virtual presence is now non-negotiable. Technical factors matter: lighting, camera angle, background, engagement techniques. These aren't superficial details—they directly impact how you're perceived professionally.

"Listen to learn" versus "listen to respond" represents a fundamental mindset shift. Many people listen just long enough to formulate their rebuttal. Leaders who actively listen—who ask clarifying questions and genuinely seek understanding—are seen as more effective. This is especially important in cross-cultural contexts where misunderstanding is more likely.

Authenticity beats polish. Research shows people value genuine communication over scripted corporate-speak. This doesn't mean being unprepared—it means being yourself when prepared.

The statistic about CEOs spending 30% of their time with external stakeholders illustrates that communication isn't an occasional performance—it's continuous relationship management.

For Zoom meetings: Position your camera at eye level, not looking down. Ensure good lighting from the front, not behind (backlighting makes you a silhouette). Minimize distractions in your background. These signal professionalism.

In Vietnamese context, showing respect through attentive listening is even more important in virtual meetings when you can't use physical presence cues like standing when someone senior enters the room.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="framework" title="Appearance Element">

## Appearance: From Formal to Authentic

| Old Rules (Pre-2020) | New Rules (2024) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Dress formally at all times | Dress for "new normal" (authenticity over formality) |
| Physical presence = commitment | Show up in person when possible (still signals commitment) |
| Minimize personal brand | Build online image (digital presence matters) |
| Follow dress code rigidly | Authenticity is paramount |

**Key insight:** Appearance is now the LEAST important of the three elements, but authenticity is the MOST important sub-component *(Hewlett, 2024)*

<speaker-notes>
The biggest shift in executive presence research: appearance matters less overall, but authenticity within appearance matters more than ever. Don't ignore appearance—presentation still matters—but prioritize being genuine over being perfectly polished.

Online image is now part of "appearance." Your LinkedIn profile, professional social media presence, and digital footprint contribute to how people perceive your executive presence before they meet you.

Showing up in person still matters and demonstrates investment in relationships. In hybrid work environments, choosing to be physically present signals commitment. However, the definition of "appropriate" dress has relaxed significantly.

In Vietnamese context, balance traditional respect for formal dress with authenticity. Vietnamese business culture still tends toward formality more than Western startups, but this is shifting among younger professionals and tech companies.

For your presentations: Dress appropriately for an academic setting, but focus more energy on developing gravitas and communication skills. Those elements have greater impact on your grade and career success.

How many of you have a professional LinkedIn profile? That's part of modern executive appearance. If you don't have one, consider creating it—it's becoming expected for business professionals.
</speaker-notes>

<slide number="11" layout="framework" title="CEO Communication Framework">

## The EDGE Framework for Executive Communications

*Based on 80+ CEO interviews (McKinsey, 2025)*

| Element | Focus | Application to You |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **E – Expanded** | Communicate to multiple stakeholder groups | Your presentation addresses faculty, peers, and guests |
| **D – Distinctive** | Develop personal narrative ("The Four W's") | Your unique perspective and story |
| **G – Growth-oriented** | Empower multiple voices | Team presentations require coordination |
| **E – Engaged** | Maintain consistent rhythm | Rehearsal consistency, not last-minute prep |

### The Four W's Narrative Structure:

1. **Who you are** – Identity, values (authenticity)
2. **Why you are here** – Purpose, mission (motivation)
3. **What you will achieve** – Agenda with accountability (vision)
4. **When you will execute** – Timeline and immediate actions (urgency)

<speaker-notes>
This EDGE framework comes from studying CEOs at the highest performance level—Fortune 100 companies. It shows that communication at the executive level is strategic and systematic, not spontaneous.

Expanded communication means addressing multiple stakeholder groups simultaneously. In your presentation, you're speaking to faculty (who grade you), peers (who learn from you), and potentially guests. Each group has different priorities.

Distinctive language creates lasting impact. Satya Nadella at Microsoft created the phrase "learn it all" versus "know it all"—proprietary language that became cultural shorthand for Microsoft's transformation. For your presentation, can you create one memorable phrase that captures your core message?

Growth-oriented communication empowers multiple voices. In team presentations, this means coordination where everyone contributes meaningfully rather than one person dominating.

Engaged communication means maintaining consistent rhythm—regular rehearsals, not cramming the night before.

For your presentations, apply the Four W's structure in your opening: Who you are (team introduction), why you are here (why this topic matters—significance), what you will achieve (agenda and key takeaways), when you will execute (structure and timing).

Think about your presentation topic: What's your "why you are here"? Why does your topic matter to your audience? That's your motivational hook.

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Executive Presence Success Factors">

## Success Factors for Developing Executive Presence

### Gravitas Development:
- **Build deep expertise** in your domain—mastery creates confidence
- **Practice decisiveness** in low-stakes situations to develop muscle memory
- **Seek diverse perspectives** actively—ask "What am I missing?"
- **Own your mistakes** publicly—builds credibility and psychological safety

### Communication Development:
- **Record yourself** presenting—watch for verbal tics, pace, energy
- **Practice "listen to learn"**—ask 3 clarifying questions before responding
- **Master virtual presence**—test lighting, camera angle, background before important meetings
- **Develop vocal variety**—pitch, pace, pause, volume create engagement

### Appearance Development:
- **Audit your digital footprint**—Google yourself, review social media
- **Dress one level up** from audience expectations
- **Maintain energy**—physical fitness impacts executive presence
- **Be consistently authentic**—people notice when you're performing versus being genuine

<speaker-notes>
These are practical, actionable steps you can take to develop each element of executive presence systematically.

Gravitas development: Deep expertise is the foundation. You can't fake confidence when you don't know your material. Practice decisiveness in low-stakes situations—volunteer to make team decisions, practice stating opinions clearly. This builds muscle memory for high-stakes moments.

Communication development: Recording yourself is uncomfortable but highly effective. You'll notice habits you don't catch in the moment—saying "um," looking down, speaking too fast. "Listen to learn" requires conscious practice: force yourself to ask three clarifying questions before offering your opinion.

Vocal variety is critical and often overlooked. Monotone delivery kills engagement even with excellent content. Practice varying your pitch (high to low), pace (fast to slow), pause (strategic silence), and volume (loud to soft).

Appearance development: Google yourself right now. What comes up? That's your digital appearance. If there's nothing, you need to build professional presence. If there's inappropriate content, you need to clean it up.

"Dress one level up" means if your audience is business casual, you wear business professional. If they're in t-shirts, you wear business casual. This shows respect without overdoing it.

Physical fitness impacts executive presence because energy, posture, and endurance affect how you're perceived. You don't need to be an athlete, but basic fitness helps you project confidence.

Consistency in authenticity is crucial. If you're one person in small meetings and a different person on stage, people notice and trust decreases. Find your authentic professional self and maintain it across contexts.

Which of these success factors will you focus on first? Identify one specific behavior to practice before your Week 12 presentation.

<!-- SEGMENT 2: CRISIS COMMUNICATION -->

<slide number="13" layout="section-break" title="Segment 2 Introduction">

# SEGMENT 2

## Crisis Communication Fundamentals

*Responding strategically when stakes are highest*

<speaker-notes>
We're shifting from individual executive presence to organizational-level communication. Crises represent the ultimate high-stakes situation—when problems emerge publicly and stakeholders are watching how you respond.

Crisis communication isn't about panic management—it's about systematic response guided by research-backed frameworks.

We'll learn SCCT: Situational Crisis Communication Theory, developed by W. Timothy Coombs. This is the most-cited framework in crisis communication research with over 2,044 academic citations. It's the gold standard because it's empirically tested, not just based on case studies.

Crisis in your context might not be organizational-level scandal, but you will face presentation crises: technology failure, unexpected challenging question you're unprepared for, team member who doesn't show up. These are personal crises that require structured response.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="SCCT Foundation">

## Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)

**Definition:** A prescriptive framework that matches crisis response strategies to crisis types based on stakeholder attribution of organizational responsibility *(Coombs, 2007)*

### Core Mechanism

**Attribution Theory:** Stakeholders assess whether crises resulted from situational (external) or organizational (internal) factors

**Key Insight:** Attribution of responsibility drives emotional and behavioral responses

**Application:** Match response intensity to perceived responsibility level

**Foundation:** SCCT is the first empirically-tested, evidence-based crisis communication theory—not just case studies, but experimental validation

<speaker-notes>
SCCT gives you a decision framework when you're under pressure and emotional regulation is difficult. Unlike vague advice like "be transparent" or "communicate quickly," SCCT tells you exactly what to do based on the type of crisis you're facing.

Attribution Theory is the foundation: People naturally assign blame when something goes wrong. They assess whether the crisis was your fault (internal attribution) or bad luck (external attribution).

For example: A natural disaster is external attribution. A product defect from cutting corners is internal attribution. Your response strategy must match the level of responsibility stakeholders attribute to you.

This is why SCCT is prescriptive, not just descriptive. It tells you: "If stakeholders perceive high responsibility, you MUST use rebuild strategies like apology and compensation. If stakeholders perceive low responsibility, you CAN use diminish strategies like excuses." The matching principle is crucial.

With 2,044+ academic citations, SCCT is the gold standard in crisis communication research. It's been tested experimentally with different crisis scenarios, organizations, and cultures.

In Vietnamese business culture, there's often a cultural tendency to protect face when something goes wrong. SCCT helps you balance face-saving with taking appropriate responsibility. Sometimes the culturally comfortable response—minimizing blame—is strategically wrong if stakeholders perceive high responsibility.

Pair-share: Think of a recent organizational failure you've observed—airline delay, product recall, service interruption. Was it perceived as internal fault (the organization messed up) or external fault (circumstances beyond control)? Understanding attribution is step one.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="framework" title="Crisis Type Clusters">

## Three Crisis Clusters Based on Responsibility

| Cluster | Responsibility Level | Examples |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **VICTIM** | Low (external attribution) | Natural disasters, rumors, workplace violence, product tampering (external) |
| **ACCIDENTAL** | Moderate (mixed attribution) | Technical-error accidents, stakeholder challenges, technical product harm |
| **INTENTIONAL/PREVENTABLE** | High (internal attribution) | Human-error accidents, organizational misdeed, management misconduct |

**Critical rule:** Crisis history and prior reputation act as "intensifying factors" that escalate required response level

<speaker-notes>
SCCT categorizes every crisis into one of three clusters based on the level of responsibility stakeholders perceive. This categorization determines your response strategy.

Victim cluster: The organization is seen as a victim of circumstances. Examples include terrorist attacks, false rumors, natural disasters, or external product tampering. Responsibility attribution is low because external forces caused the crisis. The 1982 Tylenol poisonings are the classic example—someone externally tampered with products. Johnson & Johnson was a victim but responded with full transparency and product recall, which became a case study in effective crisis management.

Accidental cluster: The organization had some control but didn't intend harm. Examples include equipment malfunction despite regular maintenance, technical errors, or stakeholder challenges. Attribution is moderate—mixed between organizational and situational factors. If your presentation technology fails, this is accidental cluster. You didn't intend it, but you bear some responsibility for contingency planning.

Intentional/Preventable cluster: The organization caused the crisis through conscious choices or negligence. Examples include human-error accidents from inadequate training, organizational misdeed, or management misconduct. Attribution is high because stakeholders believe this was preventable. If your team forgot to include required content because you didn't coordinate properly, that's intentional/preventable.

The critical rule about intensifying factors is crucial: If you've had crises before or have a bad reputation, stakeholders assign MORE responsibility to current crises. A company with a perfect safety record gets more benefit of the doubt than a company with repeated violations.

In Vietnamese context, if an organization has prior reputation issues, even a minor problem can be perceived as intentional/preventable because stakeholders assume a pattern.

If your presentation technology fails, which cluster is that? Accidental—it's a mixed attribution situation.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="framework" title="Crisis Response Strategies">

## Four Crisis Response Postures

| Posture | Strategies | Best For | Risk |
|---------|-----------|----------|------|
| **DENY** | Attack accuser, denial, scapegoating | Misinformation situations ONLY | Severe credibility damage if misapplied |
| **DIMINISH** | Excuse, justification | Accidental cluster crises | Insufficient for intentional crises |
| **REBUILD** | Compensation, full apology | Intentional/preventable crises | Expensive, admits fault |
| **BOLSTERING** | Remind of past good works, ingratiation | Supplementary strategy only | Cannot stand alone |

**Matching rule:** Higher perceived responsibility requires more accommodative responses

### Ethical Base Response for ALL Crises:
- **Instructing information** (safety guidance)
- **Adjusting information** (expressing concern)

<speaker-notes>
Four response postures, each matched to specific crisis types. Critical warning: NEVER use denial outside misinformation situations. Misapplying denial when stakeholders perceive responsibility causes severe credibility damage.

Deny posture: Use only for false rumors or misinformation. Example: "We did NOT use contaminated ingredients" when the rumor is objectively false. Strategies include denial, attacking the accuser if they're spreading falsehoods, or scapegoating external bad actors. This is high-risk because if you're wrong about the facts, you've destroyed your credibility.

Diminish posture: For accidental cluster crises. Strategies include excuses ("Equipment malfunctioned despite regular maintenance") and justification ("The benefits of this product outweigh the minor risks"). This works when attribution is moderate. However, diminish is insufficient for intentional/preventable crises—stakeholders will see it as deflecting responsibility.

Rebuild posture: For intentional/preventable crises. Requires full apology and often compensation. Example: "We made a mistake, and here's specifically what we're doing to make it right and prevent recurrence." This is expensive and explicitly admits fault, but it's the only appropriate response when stakeholders perceive high responsibility.

The Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 was intentional/preventable (human error from inadequate safety protocols), but Exxon used diminish posture (excuses). Result: reputational disaster that persists decades later.

Bolstering posture: "Remember our 20-year safety record" or "We've been serving this community for decades." This helps buffer reputation but cannot be your primary response. It's always supplementary. Using only bolstering makes you sound like you're avoiding the issue.

ALL crises require ethical base responses: Instructing information (what should stakeholders do to stay safe?) and adjusting information (expressing genuine concern for those affected). These are non-negotiable minimums regardless of crisis type.

What response posture would you use if your team forgot to include required content in your presentation? Rebuild—take responsibility, explain how you'll fix it, apologize to the audience for the gap. Don't make excuses or blame team members publicly.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Crisis Response Examples">

## SCCT in Action: Response Strategy Examples

### Victim Cluster → Deny/Diminish
**Crisis:** Competitor spreads false rumor about your product quality
**Response:** "This claim is categorically false. Our products meet all safety standards, as verified by independent testing. We're pursuing legal action against those spreading misinformation."

### Accidental Cluster → Diminish
**Crisis:** Equipment malfunction causes service interruption despite regular maintenance
**Response:** "We experienced an unexpected equipment failure that affected service. Our maintenance records show regular inspections, and we're implementing additional safeguards to prevent recurrence. We apologize for the inconvenience."

### Intentional/Preventable → Rebuild
**Crisis:** Data breach due to inadequate security protocols
**Response:** "We failed to protect customer data, and that's on us. We're implementing immediate security upgrades, offering credit monitoring to affected customers, and conducting a full third-party security audit. This should not have happened, and we take full responsibility."

<speaker-notes>
These examples show how response language changes based on crisis cluster.

Victim cluster response uses strong denial because the claim is objectively false. Notice the response includes evidence ("independent testing") and action ("legal action"). You don't just deny—you substantiate the denial and show consequences for false claims.

Accidental cluster response uses excuse strategy from diminish posture. "Unexpected equipment failure" explains what happened without taking full blame. "Regular maintenance records show..." provides context that you were being responsible. "Implementing additional safeguards" shows learning and improvement. "We apologize for the inconvenience" expresses concern (adjusting information) without accepting full responsibility.

Intentional/preventable response uses full rebuild strategy. "We failed" is direct ownership. "That's on us" is colloquial but reinforces accountability. Then immediately provide instructing information: specific actions being taken (security upgrades, credit monitoring, third-party audit). "This should not have happened, and we take full responsibility" is the full apology required for high-responsibility crises.

Notice how the tone and level of accountability escalate across clusters. Victim: defensive but substantiated. Accidental: explanatory with moderate apology. Intentional/preventable: full ownership and remediation.

For your presentations: If tech fails (accidental), use diminish: "We're experiencing technical difficulties. While we resolve this, let me walk you through our key points..." If you forgot content (intentional), use rebuild: "We should have included X in our analysis. That's an oversight on our part. Let me address it now..."

The key is matching response to perceived responsibility, not to what's comfortable. Many people want to minimize blame even when stakeholders perceive high responsibility. This mismatch destroys credibility.

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Crisis Case Study">

## Case Study: David Ellison (Paramount CEO)

**Context:** New CEO writing first stakeholder communication

**Crisis potential:** Media industry in turmoil, stakeholder skepticism

**Action:** Wrote CEO letter positioning sports as "powerful engine for audience engagement"

**Timeline:** Less than one week later, secured $7.7 billion UFC media rights deal

**Outcome:** Words aligned with action—built immediate credibility

**Lesson:** "Show and tell"—your crisis response must be backed by tangible action *(McKinsey, 2025)*

### Application to Your Presentations

- If something goes wrong, acknowledge it immediately (adjusting information)
- Explain what you're doing about it (instructing information)
- Follow through with action (show, don't just tell)

<speaker-notes>
This case shows crisis communication principles applied proactively rather than reactively. David Ellison became Paramount CEO in 2024 during significant industry turmoil—streaming wars, traditional media decline, financial pressure.

Instead of defensive or cautious communication, Ellison made a bold strategic claim: sports programming is a "powerful engine for audience engagement" and would be central to Paramount's strategy. Less than one week later, he announced the $7.7 billion UFC media rights deal.

This is the "show and tell" principle: your words must align with actions immediately and tangibly. Ellison didn't just say sports matter—he demonstrated it with massive investment.

For your presentations, apply this principle: If technology fails, don't just apologize verbally. Show how you'll adapt by immediately using the whiteboard, distributing handouts, or pivoting to verbal description with clear structure.

If someone asks a question that reveals a gap in your analysis, don't just say "good point"—explain specifically how you'd address that gap in the next iteration.

In Vietnamese context, "show and tell" aligns with cultural value of demonstrated competence over self-promotion. Vietnamese business culture tends to value action more than words. Don't just say you'll fix something—show the fix in real-time or commit to specific, measurable follow-up.

Pair-share for two minutes: What's one crisis that could happen during your presentation? Technology failure, missing team member, hostile question, time running short? How would you respond using SCCT principles? Which cluster would it fall into, and what response posture would you use?

<slide number="19" layout="quote" title="CEO Quotes on Communication">

> "Nothing prepares you for becoming the face of a company. Nothing."
>
> — Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz

> "I have a BA in English Literature, a minor in Computer Science, a JD, and an MBA. As CEO of Cloudflare, a fairly technical company, the most important has always been that English Literature degree."
>
> — Matt Prince, CEO of Cloudflare

<speaker-notes>
Two CEO quotes that emphasize communication as the number one executive skill, surpassing technical expertise.

Oliver Bäte's quote reveals that even experienced executives with extensive training feel unprepared for the communication stakes at the CEO level. Being "the face of a company" means every word, gesture, and decision is scrutinized by multiple stakeholder groups simultaneously. No amount of formal education fully prepares you for that pressure.

Matt Prince's quote is particularly striking for business students. He has technical training (computer science), legal training (JD), and business training (MBA). Yet he identifies his English Literature degree—focused on communication, narrative, analysis, and persuasion—as the most important credential for leading a technical company.

This isn't dismissing technical skills; it's recognizing that communication competence is the bottleneck at leadership levels.

For you, this insight is encouraging: Communication skills are your most transferable, valuable asset. Technical skills like Python, Excel, or financial modeling get you in the door and establish baseline competence. Communication skills—presenting, handling pressure, navigating difficult conversations, building relationships—get you promoted and determine your leadership trajectory.

Many students overinvest in technical skills and underinvest in communication development because technical skills are easier to measure and practice. Communication feels subjective and uncomfortable. However, research consistently shows that communication differentiates high performers from average performers more than technical expertise does.

What surprises you about Prince's statement that English Literature matters more than his technical and business degrees? Consider how that reframes the value of the communication skills you're developing in this course.

Moving from organizational-level crisis communication to interpersonal-level pressure situations. This is where most communication pressure happens in daily life, both academically and professionally.

Difficult conversations include delivering bad news, disagreeing with authority figures, addressing conflict with peers, or navigating situations where emotions run high.

Q&A sessions represent a specific high-stakes situation: responding to challenging questions without becoming defensive.

Both difficult conversations and Q&A require emotional regulation—managing your own emotions while remaining effective—and structured approaches that prevent reactive, unproductive responses.

Difficult conversations in student context include: asking a professor for grade review, addressing a teammate who isn't contributing fairly, negotiating a deadline extension, giving critical feedback to peers, or resolving group work conflicts.

Q&A in student context includes: handling questions during presentations, responding to challenges from professors or peers, addressing gaps in your analysis, or managing questions you don't know how to answer.

Let's start with the most comprehensive framework for difficult conversations—one that helps you understand why these conversations are so hard and how to navigate them productively.

<slide number="21" layout="framework" title="Three Conversations Model">

## The Three Conversations Model (Harvard Negotiation Project)

**Core insight:** Every difficult conversation contains three separate conversations happening simultaneously *(Stone, Patton, & Heen, 2023)*

### The Three Layers

**1. The "What Happened?" Conversation**
- **Focus:** Disagreements about facts, interpretations, blame
- **Common mistake:** Assuming certainty about what happened
- **Key technique:** "The And Stance"—both perspectives can be valid simultaneously
- **Critical insight:** Separate intent from impact—never assume you know why someone acted

**2. The Feelings Conversation**
- **Focus:** Emotions underlying the exchange (acknowledged or not)
- **Common mistake:** Ignoring or venting emotions
- **Key technique:** Describe feelings rather than express them reactively

**3. The Identity Conversation**
- **Focus:** Internal dialogue about what this means for who we are
- **Common mistake:** All-or-nothing identity thinking
- **Key technique:** Accept your own complexity

<speaker-notes>
This framework comes from the Harvard Negotiation Project—the same research group that created "Getting to Yes," the foundational text on principled negotiation.

The core insight is that difficult conversations are difficult because three separate conversations are happening simultaneously, and we typically focus on only one layer while ignoring the others.

The "What Happened?" conversation is about facts, interpretations, and blame. Most people assume their version of events is objectively correct and the other person's version is wrong. This is rarely true.

The "And Stance" is transformative: "You see it this way AND I see it this way" acknowledges both perspectives as valid without requiring agreement on one "truth."

Critically, separate intent from impact. You experienced a negative impact from someone's behavior, but that doesn't mean they intended to hurt you. Never assume you know why someone acted—ask instead.

The Feelings conversation is about emotions underlying the exchange, whether acknowledged or not. Common mistake one: Ignoring emotions and pretending it's purely rational discussion. This fails because emotions don't disappear when ignored—they sabotage the conversation covertly.

Common mistake two: Venting emotions reactively—"You're making me so angry!" This escalates conflict. Instead, describe feelings: "I feel frustrated when deadlines change without notice because it affects my planning." This names the emotion without blaming.

The Identity conversation is your internal dialogue about what this situation means for who you are. Difficult conversations often trigger identity questions: "Am I competent?" "Am I a good person?" When these questions are triggered, people become defensive because they're protecting self-concept, not just discussing facts.

All-or-nothing thinking makes this worse: "If I made this mistake, I'm a complete failure." Accepting your own complexity helps: "I made a mistake in this situation AND I'm generally competent."

In Vietnamese context, "face" relates directly to the identity conversation. Threats to face trigger defensive reactions because they threaten core self-concept and social standing.

Group presentation scenario: Your team member didn't finish their slides by the deadline. What Happened layer: They say they emailed you the slides; you say you never received them. Both might be true if the email went to spam. Feelings layer: You feel frustrated and stressed; they feel embarrassed and defensive. Identity layer: You're wondering "Am I a bad team leader?" They're wondering "Am I a bad team member?" These identity questions drive defensive behavior more than the factual disagreement.

<slide number="22" layout="framework" title="Learning Conversation Approach">

## Transforming Difficult Conversations into Learning Conversations

### Starting Point: The "Third Story"

Begin from how a neutral observer would describe the situation (not your version or their version)

### Core Techniques

**1. Use inquiry, paraphrasing, and acknowledgment**
- "Help me understand your perspective..."
- "What I'm hearing is... Is that right?"

**2. "Tempered speech" vs. exaggeration**
- "I felt surprised when..." (not "You ALWAYS do this")

**3. Share perspective AS perspective, not absolute truth**
- "From my perspective..." (not "The truth is...")

**Goal:** Transform difficult conversation into learning conversation

<speaker-notes>
This is the practical application of the Three Conversations Model—specific language techniques that transform difficult conversations into learning conversations. The key shift is from debate (who's right?) to learning (what can we understand together?).

The "Third Story" is your starting point. Before the conversation, imagine how a neutral observer or mediator would describe the situation. Not your version where you're the hero and they're the villain. Not their version where they're justified and you're unreasonable.

The third story is neutral: "We're having trouble coordinating on deadlines, and it's causing stress for both of us." Starting from third story reduces defensiveness because you're not assigning blame in your opening.

Technique one: Inquiry before advocacy. Ask questions before defending your position. "Help me understand your perspective on what happened" invites their story before you assert yours.

Paraphrasing builds understanding: "What I hear you saying is that you felt blindsided by the timeline change. Is that right?" This confirms understanding before responding.

Acknowledgment doesn't mean agreement—it means recognizing their perspective as real for them.

Technique two: Tempered speech. Avoid absolute language like "always" and "never" because it's usually inaccurate and feels like attack. "You never finish work on time" triggers defensiveness. "I've noticed our last three deadlines were challenging" is specific and temperate.

Use "I felt surprised" rather than "You shocked me"—this owns your emotional response rather than blaming them for causing it.

Technique three: Share perspective AS perspective. "From my perspective, when deadlines shift without discussion, I feel stressed because I can't plan effectively" acknowledges this is your view, not objective reality. "The truth is you're disorganized" presents opinion as fact and kills dialogue.

In Vietnamese context, indirect communication is often the cultural norm, which actually aligns well with these techniques. "From my perspective" is culturally appropriate because it avoids direct confrontation while still expressing your view.

However, Vietnamese indirectness sometimes becomes so subtle that the actual issue never gets addressed. These techniques let you be clear about the problem while remaining respectful in approach.

Bad approach example: "You never finish your work on time and I always have to cover for you! This is unacceptable!" This violates all three techniques.

Learning approach example: "I've noticed our timelines have been tight recently. Can we talk about how to coordinate better? From my perspective, when deadlines shift, I feel stressed because it affects my planning. How are you experiencing this?"

Pair-share for two minutes: Practice starting a difficult conversation with "Third Story." Scenario: Your teammate missed a deadline that affects your group project grade. What's the neutral third story? How would you open the conversation using these techniques?

## Mastering Q&A Sessions Without Defensiveness

### Four-Step Q&A Framework

**Step 1: ACKNOWLEDGE the question**
- "That's an excellent question"
- "I appreciate you raising that"
- **Benefit:** Shows respect, buys thinking time

**Step 2: CLARIFY if needed**
- "Just to make sure I understand, are you asking about X or Y?"
- **Benefit:** Prevents answering the wrong question

**Step 3: ANSWER directly**
- Address the question asked, not the question you wish they'd asked
- **If you don't know:** "I don't have that data, but I can find out"

**Step 4: CHECK understanding**
- "Does that address your question?"
- **Benefit:** Opens dialogue, prevents assumptions

### Handling Hostile Questions

- Use Three Conversations Model: Separate intent from impact
- Assume positive intent: "They're testing my knowledge, not attacking me"
- Stay calm: Pause, breathe, respond (don't react)

<speaker-notes>
Q&A is where executive presence gets tested most directly. You can rehearse your presentation content, but questions are unpredictable. This four-step framework gives you structure when you're stressed and thinking on your feet.

Step 1: Acknowledge the question. This serves two functions. First, it shows respect for the questioner, which reduces potential hostility. Second, it buys you 2-3 seconds to think while you're saying "That's an excellent question." Use this thinking time to process the question and formulate your approach.

Even if the question is hostile or critical, acknowledging it professionally maintains your executive presence.

Step 2: Clarify if needed. If the question is ambiguous or multi-part, clarify before answering. "Just to make sure I understand, are you asking about our methodology or our data sources?" This prevents the common mistake of answering the wrong question and looking like you didn't listen.

Clarifying also shows you're listening carefully rather than giving pre-programmed answers.

Step 3: Answer directly. Address the actual question, not the question you wish they'd asked. If you don't know the answer, say so honestly: "I don't have that specific data with me, but I can research it and follow up with you." This maintains credibility better than faking knowledge or deflecting.

Brief is better than rambling—answer the question, then stop. Don't keep talking just to fill silence.

Step 4: Check understanding. "Does that address your question?" or "Is there a specific aspect you'd like me to elaborate on?" This confirms they're satisfied and opens continued dialogue if needed. It also prevents you from assuming you've answered when you haven't.

For hostile questions, use the Three Conversations Model principle: Separate intent from impact. You experienced the question as hostile (impact), but assume they're testing your knowledge depth rather than attacking your character (intent). This mindset shift keeps you from becoming defensive.

Stay calm by pausing, taking a breath if needed, and responding thoughtfully rather than reacting emotionally.

Hostile question example: "Your data looks questionable. How do we know this is accurate?"

Bad response: "Are you saying I'm lying?" This is defensive and escalates.

Good response: "Great question—let me walk you through our methodology and data sources so you can assess the rigor yourself." This acknowledges, stays calm, and answers substance.

What's the hardest part of Q&A for most people? Thinking on your feet under pressure, or staying calm when challenged? Both are skills you can develop with practice and frameworks.

## Case Study: Handling Surprise Questions

**Scenario:** Student presenting marketing plan; professor asks: "Why didn't you consider influencer marketing? That's the obvious strategy for Gen Z."

### Poor Response (Defensive)

"We did consider it! It's just not in the slides because we ran out of time."

**Analysis:** Defensive tone, makes excuses, sounds unprepared

### Strong Response (Executive Presence)

"Excellent question—influencer marketing is highly relevant for Gen Z. We evaluated it and chose not to prioritize it for two reasons: budget constraints and timeline. However, I'd be happy to discuss how we'd incorporate it in Phase 2. Would that be helpful?"

### Why This Works:

- Acknowledges question (shows respect)
- Answers directly (transparency)
- Provides reasoning (demonstrates thought process)
- Offers to continue dialogue (engagement)

<speaker-notes>
Real scenario that happens frequently in business presentations: Someone asks why you didn't consider what seems like an obvious option. This feels threatening because it implies your analysis was incomplete. How you respond determines whether this damages or enhances your credibility.

Poor response problems: "We did consider it!" sounds immediately defensive. Adding "It's just not in the slides because we ran out of time" makes excuses and actually suggests poor planning—why would you run out of time discussing a major strategic option?

This response doesn't address the substance of the question—it defends against perceived attack. The professor is left thinking: "They didn't really consider it thoroughly."

Strong response breakdown: "Excellent question" acknowledges while buying thinking time. "Influencer marketing is highly relevant for Gen Z" shows you understand the field and validates the questioner's expertise.

"We evaluated it and chose not to prioritize it" directly addresses the question—you DID consider it. "For two reasons: budget constraints and timeline" provides specific reasoning that demonstrates analytical thinking.

"However, I'd be happy to discuss how we'd incorporate it in Phase 2" shows strategic thinking beyond immediate scope. "Would that be helpful?" invites continued engagement rather than defensively shutting down.

Notice the strong response doesn't apologize or make excuses—it explains reasoning. This is more effective because it demonstrates competence rather than defensiveness. The tone throughout is confident and respectful, not combative or submissive.

In Vietnamese context, direct disagreement with a professor or authority figure can be face-threatening for both parties. "Excellent question" shows respect and acknowledges the professor's expertise, which protects their face. Then explaining your reasoning protects your own face by demonstrating competence.

The strong response also uses the Four-Step Framework implicitly: Acknowledges ("excellent question"), clarifies implicitly (restates the question concept), answers directly ("we evaluated it... for two reasons"), and checks ("would that be helpful?").

Notice how word choice and structure create completely different impressions from essentially the same content. The poor response might actually have the same underlying message—we did consider it but chose not to include it—but the defensive framing undermines credibility.

<slide number="25" layout="framework" title="Advanced Q&A Techniques">

## Advanced Techniques for Really Tough Questions

### The "Bridge" Technique

**When:** Question is off-topic or unanswerable

**How:** Bridge to what you CAN discuss

**Example:**
- *Question:* "What's your company's revenue projection for 2030?"
- *Bridge:* "While I don't have 2030 projections, what I can share is our current growth trajectory and the market factors that will influence long-term performance..."

### The "Parking Lot" Technique

**When:** Question deserves deep discussion but time is limited

**Example:** "That's a complex question that deserves more than a quick answer. Can we add that to the parking lot and discuss it in detail after the presentation?"

### The "Turn It Back" Technique

**When:** Question is really an opinion disguised as a question

**Example:**
- *Question:* "Don't you think email marketing is dead?"
- *Response:* "That's an interesting perspective. What makes you think that?" *(Then address after hearing their reasoning)*

<speaker-notes>
Three advanced techniques for when the basic four-step framework isn't sufficient. These handle edge cases where standard Q&A approaches don't work.

Bridge technique: Use when the question is off-topic, too far in the future, or asks for information you don't have. The key is acknowledging the question's validity while redirecting to related content you CAN address.

"While I don't have 2030 projections" avoids faking knowledge. "What I can share is our current growth trajectory and market factors" bridges to relevant information you do have.

Never make up answers you don't know—bridge to what you can legitimately discuss. Example: "I don't have competitor-specific data, but what I can share is the market dynamics that affect all players in this space..."

Parking Lot technique: Use when a question deserves substantial discussion but you're time-constrained. The critical requirement is you MUST actually follow up later. Don't use parking lot as a brush-off technique—that destroys credibility.

Visibly write down the question or designate someone to track it. After the presentation, make time for the parking lot discussion. This technique shows you value the question enough to give it proper attention rather than a rushed response.

Turn It Back technique: Use when someone poses an opinion as a question. "Don't you think email marketing is dead?" isn't really a question—it's a statement of opinion seeking agreement or debate.

Turning it back—"That's an interesting perspective. What makes you think that?"—accomplishes two things. First, you learn their reasoning before responding, which helps you address their actual concerns. Second, you avoid immediately disagreeing, which can create adversarial dynamics.

In Vietnamese context, "Turn It Back" can feel confrontational if not done carefully. Soften with: "I'd be curious to hear more about your perspective on that..." or "That's an interesting viewpoint. Could you share what's shaped your thinking?"

Which technique would you use if someone asks about a competitor you don't know much about? Bridge technique—redirect to market dynamics you DO understand. "While I'm not familiar with that specific company's approach, what I can share is how industry leaders generally approach this challenge..."

These advanced techniques prevent you from getting trapped by questions outside your knowledge scope or time constraints.

<!-- SEGMENT 4: INTEGRATION -->

<slide number="26" layout="section-break" title="Segment 4 Introduction">

# SEGMENT 4

## Integration & Application

*Bringing it all together for your presentations*

<speaker-notes>
We've covered three major frameworks today: Executive Presence Model (gravitas, communication, appearance), SCCT (crisis communication), and the Three Conversations Model (difficult conversations plus Q&A techniques).

Each framework addresses different pressure situations, but they share common foundations.

Now we integrate these frameworks for your Week 12 presentations. You won't face Fortune 500-level organizational crises, but you will face pressure: technology failures, team coordination challenges, difficult questions, unexpected problems.

These frameworks give you systematic tools for different pressure situations rather than hoping you'll improvise effectively under stress.

The integration principle is that all frameworks share a common foundation: emotional regulation (managing your own stress response) and respect (maintaining productive relationships despite pressure).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="framework" title="Framework Integration">

## How the Frameworks Work Together

| Pressure Situation | Framework to Apply | Key Action |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Building overall credibility | Executive Presence Model | Focus on gravitas (confidence + respect) and communication (virtual + listening) |
| Something goes wrong | SCCT Crisis Response | Match response to responsibility level: acknowledge (adjusting info) + explain fix (instructing info) |
| Team conflict during prep | Three Conversations Model | Use "Third Story" + separate intent from impact |
| Challenging Q&A question | Four-Step Q&A Framework | Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check |

**Integration principle:** All frameworks share common foundation—stay calm, show respect, respond (don't react)

<speaker-notes>
This is your cheat sheet for which framework to use in different situations. Notice the common thread running through all frameworks: emotional regulation and respect for others.

Executive Presence is your baseline for all communication—the foundation you maintain throughout. Gravitas (confidence combined with respect), communication (speaking and listening effectively), and authentic appearance create your credibility foundation. This is always active, not situation-specific.

SCCT applies when organizational-level problems occur: technology failure during your presentation, missing team member, content error discovered mid-presentation. Match your response to the responsibility cluster.

If it's accidental (tech failure), use adjusting information ("we're experiencing technical difficulties") and instructing information ("while we troubleshoot, let me walk through the key points verbally"). Maintain executive presence throughout—stay calm and decisive even when stressed.

Three Conversations Model applies when interpersonal conflict arises: disagreement with teammate about work division, conflict over quality standards, tension about who presents which section. Use "Third Story" to open the conversation from neutral ground. Separate intent from impact—they might not have intended to frustrate you even though their behavior had that impact.

Four-Step Q&A Framework applies when facing challenging questions: unexpected questions, hostile questions, questions revealing gaps in your analysis. Acknowledge (show respect, buy time), clarify (ensure you understand), answer directly (address substance), check understanding (confirm satisfaction).

All four approaches require the same foundation: Pause before responding (don't react immediately when stressed), assume positive intent (most people aren't trying to attack you), and show respect (maintain relationships despite pressure).

When you're stressed, your instinct is often to become defensive, aggressive, or avoidant. These frameworks give you structure that overrides unproductive instincts.

Real scenario: Team member doesn't show up for your presentation. SCCT application: This is accidental cluster (they're sick, not malicious). Response: Acknowledge situation ("We're one person short today due to illness"), explain adaptation ("We've redistributed their content among the team"). Executive Presence: Maintain gravitas—show confidence despite the problem. Don't apologize excessively or make excuses.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="content" title="Comprehensive Case Study">

## Comprehensive Case: The Perfect Storm

**Scenario:** Your team is presenting on sustainable business practices.

### Crisis 1: Technology fails—slides won't display

**Framework:** SCCT (accidental cluster)

**Response:** "We're experiencing a technical issue. While we troubleshoot, let me walk you through our key findings verbally..." *(adjusting info + instructing info)*

**Executive presence:** Maintain gravitas—stay calm, be decisive

### Crisis 2: During Q&A, audience member aggressively challenges your data

**Framework:** Four-Step Q&A + Three Conversations Model

**Response:** "Thank you for that question *(acknowledge)*. Just to clarify, are you questioning our data sources or our interpretation? *(clarify)*. Our data comes from [source], and here's our methodology... *(answer)*. Does that address your concern? *(check)*"

**Mindset:** Separate intent from impact—they're testing rigor, not attacking you personally

### Crisis 3: After presentation, teammate blames you for tech failure

**Framework:** Three Conversations Model

**Response:** "I know we're both frustrated. From my perspective, the tech failure was unexpected—I tested everything yesterday. I'm guessing you're concerned about how it affected our grade? Can we talk about what we can learn from this?"

<speaker-notes>
This scenario combines all three pressure situations in one presentation—organizational crisis, hostile Q&A, and team conflict. Notice how different frameworks apply to different moments, but executive presence maintains throughout.

Crisis 1—Technology failure: This is SCCT territory. Categorize it: accidental cluster (you didn't intend it, but you bear some responsibility for contingency planning).

Response strategy: Adjusting information first—acknowledge the problem without excessive apology: "We're experiencing a technical issue." Instructing information immediately—explain what you're doing: "While we troubleshoot, let me walk through our key findings verbally."

Throughout the tech failure, maintain executive presence: Gravitas shows in staying calm and decisive rather than panicking. Don't say "I'm so sorry, this is so embarrassing..." That undermines confidence. Instead: "We've got a plan B ready. Let me walk you through the content."

Crisis 2—Aggressive Q&A: Apply Four-Step Framework combined with Three Conversations insight. "Thank you for that question" acknowledges and buys thinking time. "Just to clarify, are you questioning our data sources or our interpretation?" clarifies what they're actually challenging.

"Our data comes from [specific source], and here's our methodology..." answers the substance directly. "Does that address your concern?" checks understanding and invites continued dialogue.

Critically, use Three Conversations principle: Separate intent from impact. You experienced their question as aggressive attack (impact), but assume they're testing analytical rigor rather than attacking your character (intent). This mindset shift prevents you from responding defensively.

Crisis 3—Team conflict after presentation: Pure Three Conversations Model application. Your teammate is upset and blaming you. "I know we're both frustrated" acknowledges feelings conversation—emotions are real and valid.

"From my perspective, the tech failure was unexpected—I tested everything yesterday" shares your perspective AS perspective, not as absolute truth. You're not saying "It's not my fault" which is defensive.

"I'm guessing you're concerned about how it affected our grade?" addresses the identity conversation—they're worried about competence. "Can we talk about what we can learn from this?" shifts from blame to learning conversation.

Pair-share for three minutes: Walk through this scenario with a partner. How would you specifically respond at each crisis point? What would you say word-for-word? Practice the language, not just the concepts.

<!-- WRAP-UP -->

<slide number="29" layout="framework" title="Key Takeaways">

## Key Takeaways: High-Stakes Communication

### 1. Executive Presence is Learnable

- Focus on gravitas (confidence + inclusiveness), communication (virtual + listening), and authentic appearance
- Sound of voice matters 2x as much as content
- Post-pandemic shifts: authenticity over formality, virtual presence mandatory, "listen to learn" orientation

### 2. Match Crisis Response to Responsibility Level

- SCCT provides structure: Victim → Deny, Accidental → Diminish, Intentional → Rebuild
- Always provide adjusting information (concern) + instructing information (action)
- Mismatching response to attribution destroys credibility

### 3. Difficult Conversations Have Three Layers

- What Happened (facts), Feelings (emotions), Identity (self-concept)
- Use "Third Story" and separate intent from impact
- Transform debate into learning conversation

### 4. Q&A Framework: Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check

- Assume positive intent, stay calm, respond (don't react)
- Advanced techniques: Bridge, Parking Lot, Turn It Back

### 5. All Frameworks Share Foundation: Emotional Regulation + Respect

- Pause before responding when stressed
- Show respect for others even in conflict
- Frameworks override defensive instincts

<speaker-notes>
Five core takeaways that summarize today's lecture. These frameworks apply far beyond academic presentations—you'll use them in job interviews, client meetings, team leadership, and throughout your career.

Takeaway 1: Executive Presence is learnable, not innate. You can systematically develop gravitas by practicing confidence combined with respect. Develop communication skills by improving both speaking and listening, in-person and virtual. Work on authentic appearance—be genuine rather than performed.

Hewlett's research shows the sound of your voice matters twice as much as the content of what you say—practice vocal delivery, pacing, and tone.

Takeaway 2: SCCT provides structure for crisis response. Don't panic—systematically categorize the crisis type, then match your response strategy. Remember the ethical base for ALL crises: adjusting information (express concern) and instructing information (explain what to do). These are non-negotiable minimums.

The critical warning: Mismatching your response to stakeholder attribution destroys credibility. If they perceive high responsibility and you use diminish strategy, you look like you're deflecting. If they perceive low responsibility and you over-apologize, you look weak.

Takeaway 3: Difficult conversations have three layers operating simultaneously. Most people focus only on "What Happened" (facts) while ignoring Feelings (emotions) and Identity (self-concept). Effective communicators address all three layers.

Use "Third Story" to start from neutral ground. Separate intent from impact—assume positive intent even when you experienced negative impact.

Takeaway 4: Four-Step Q&A Framework gives you structure under pressure. Acknowledge (show respect, buy thinking time), Clarify (ensure understanding), Answer directly (address substance), Check understanding (confirm satisfaction).

Assume positive intent—most questions are testing your knowledge, not attacking your character. Stay calm by pausing and breathing before responding.

Advanced techniques (Bridge, Parking Lot, Turn It Back) handle edge cases when basic framework isn't sufficient.

Takeaway 5: All frameworks share common foundation. Emotional regulation—managing your stress response so you can think clearly under pressure. Respect—maintaining productive relationships despite challenges. These are the core competencies that make all frameworks work.

Which framework do you think you'll use first? In what specific situation? Self-awareness about your communication challenges helps you target improvement efforts.

<slide number="30" layout="framework" title="Practical Application Checklist">

## Your High-Stakes Communication Toolkit

### Before Your Presentation

- [ ] **Develop executive presence:** Record yourself practicing—assess gravitas, vocal variety, virtual presence
- [ ] **Prepare crisis responses:** Identify 3 likely problems and plan SCCT responses
- [ ] **Rehearse Q&A:** Have peers ask challenging questions, practice Four-Step Framework
- [ ] **Audit appearance:** Check digital presence, dress appropriately, ensure good lighting/camera angle

### During Pressure Situations

- [ ] **Technology fails:** Accidental cluster → adjusting info + instructing info, maintain gravitas
- [ ] **Hostile question:** Separate intent from impact, Four-Step Framework
- [ ] **Team conflict:** Three Conversations Model—start with Third Story
- [ ] **Unknown answer:** Bridge to what you DO know, or admit gap and commit to follow-up

### After High-Stakes Events

- [ ] **Debrief with team:** Learning conversation, not blame assignment
- [ ] **Self-assess:** What worked? What needs improvement?
- [ ] **Follow up:** Parking lot questions, promised information
- [ ] **Apply lessons:** Update your approach based on what you learned

<speaker-notes>
This is your practical toolkit—specific actions you can take before, during, and after high-stakes communication situations.

Before your presentation: Recording yourself is uncomfortable but highly effective. You'll notice habits you don't catch in the moment—verbal tics, lack of vocal variety, defensive body language.

Assess your executive presence: Do you project gravitas (confidence + respect)? Is your vocal delivery engaging or monotone? For virtual presentations, is your lighting/camera angle professional?

Prepare crisis responses by identifying three likely problems for your specific presentation. Technology might fail—what's your plan B? Someone might ask about a topic you didn't cover—how will you respond? Team member might struggle—how will you support them?

Planning responses in advance makes them available under pressure when you can't think as clearly.

Rehearse Q&A with peers who've been instructed to ask challenging questions. Practice the Four-Step Framework until it becomes automatic: Acknowledge, Clarify, Answer, Check.

During pressure situations: Each crisis type maps to a framework. Technology fails → SCCT (accidental cluster). Hostile question → Four-Step Q&A + separate intent from impact. Team conflict → Three Conversations Model.

When you don't know an answer, never fake it. Either bridge to what you DO know, or admit the gap honestly and commit to finding out: "I don't have that data, but I can research it and follow up with you."

After high-stakes events: Debrief with your team using learning conversation approach, not blame assignment. "What worked well? What could we improve next time?" This is Third Story application—neutral, learning-oriented.

Self-assessment is crucial for improvement. What specific behaviors worked? What needs development? Be specific: "I need to pause longer before answering questions" is actionable. "I need to be better at Q&A" is too vague.

Follow up on parking lot questions and any information you promised. This builds credibility and demonstrates professionalism.

Apply lessons: Update your approach based on what you learned. If you discovered you speak too fast when nervous, practice slowing down. If you realized you don't handle unexpected questions well, do more Q&A rehearsal.

Which checklist items will you prioritize for your Week 12 presentation? Start with the areas where you have the most room for improvement.

## Tutorial Activity: Executive Presence Practice

**Today's Tutorial (90 min):**

### Activity 1: Q&A Simulation (40 min)

- Present 3-minute summary of your team's presentation topic
- Face 5 minutes of challenging questions from peers
- Apply Four-Step Q&A Framework
- Receive peer feedback on executive presence

### Activity 2: Difficult Conversation Role-Play (35 min)

- Navigate a team conflict scenario using Three Conversations Model
- Practice "Third Story" and separating intent from impact
- Debrief: What worked? What was hard?

### Deliverable: Written reflection on what worked, what you'll improve

**Reminder:** Week 12 Group Presentation (25%) + Individual Grade (15%) includes mandatory 10-minute Q&A. Today's practice directly prepares you for that graded component.

<speaker-notes>
Tutorial applies all frameworks you learned today in safe, low-stakes practice environment. This is your opportunity to develop muscle memory for these techniques before your graded presentation.

Activity 1—Q&A Simulation: You'll present a 3-minute summary of your team's presentation topic (condensed version, focusing on key argument). Then you'll face 5 minutes of challenging questions from peers who've been instructed to ask tough questions—not hostile, but substantive challenges.

Apply the Four-Step Framework: Acknowledge, Clarify, Answer, Check. Your peers will give you feedback on your executive presence during Q&A.

The goal is to experience pressure in a low-stakes environment. Athletes practice under pressure before game day—this is your practice. You'll discover which aspects of Q&A are hardest for you: thinking on your feet, staying calm when challenged, or admitting when you don't know something.

Activity 2—Difficult Conversation Role-Play: You'll receive a scenario involving team conflict—typical issues like unequal work distribution, missed deadlines, or quality disagreements. Practice using "Third Story" to open the conversation neutrally.

Practice separating intent from impact—your partner's behavior affected you negatively, but assume they didn't intend harm. Navigate all three layers: What Happened, Feelings, and Identity.

Deliverable: Written reflection on what worked and what you'll improve. Metacognition—thinking about your thinking—accelerates learning. Identify specific behaviors you'll practice: "I need to pause longer before answering questions" or "I need to work on not saying 'does that make sense?' after every answer."

Remember: Your Week 12 Group Presentation includes mandatory 10-minute Q&A that's explicitly graded. Today's practice directly prepares you for that assessment component.

**Pre-reading:** Meyer, E. (2014). *The Culture Map* (Ch. 1-4)

<speaker-notes>
Next week builds on today's content by examining executive presence in cross-cultural contexts. High-stakes communication becomes even more complex when cultural differences affect expectations, interpretation, and appropriate responses.

Cultural Dimensions Theory from Geert Hofstede provides framework for understanding how culture shapes communication preferences. For example, high-context versus low-context communication: Vietnamese culture tends toward high-context where meaning is often implied; Western business culture tends toward low-context where everything must be explicit.

Virtual team communication strategies are increasingly important in globalized business environment. How do you build trust remotely? How do you navigate time zones and asynchronous communication?

Collaborative presentations require coordination across different work styles, communication preferences, and quality standards. We'll examine how to divide work effectively, integrate individual contributions into coherent whole, and handle common team challenges.

Feedback culture—both giving and receiving constructive feedback—improves presentation quality. We'll practice feedback techniques that are specific, actionable, and respectful. In Vietnamese context, direct negative feedback can be face-threatening, so we'll examine culturally appropriate ways to provide critical feedback that drives improvement.

Your Week 12 group presentations require all these skills: coordinating across diverse team communication styles, potentially navigating cultural differences if you have international students on your team, and giving/receiving feedback during preparation to improve quality.

Pre-reading is Erin Meyer's "The Culture Map," chapters 1-4. This is accessible through library and provides excellent framework for cross-cultural communication.

### Tools

- Practice Q&A with peers before Week 12
- Record yourself on video to assess executive presence
- Audit your digital footprint (Google yourself)

<speaker-notes>
All required readings are accessible: two are open access, two are available via university library or ResearchGate. These sources will appear on your Week 11 comprehensive quiz, so engage with them thoroughly.

Hewlett 2024 and McKinsey 2025 provide recent, practical applications of executive presence and CEO communication. Both articles include specific examples and actionable advice. Hewlett's article specifically compares 2012 to 2022 data, showing post-pandemic shifts in executive expectations.

McKinsey's article includes the EDGE framework we covered today plus downloadable reflection exercises you can use for presentation preparation.

Coombs 2007 is the foundational SCCT theory article with 2,044+ academic citations. This is the original source for crisis communication framework. It's academic rather than practitioner-focused, but reading the source material deepens understanding. The article includes experimental validation showing how different response strategies affect stakeholder perceptions.

Stone, Patton, and Heen 2023 is the comprehensive guide to difficult conversations. The 3rd edition updates the original with recent examples and expanded coverage of virtual communication. This is from Harvard's Program on Negotiation—gold standard in conflict resolution research. Very readable, with extensive examples and practice exercises.

Stanford podcast from Grousbeck and Abrahams features excellent role-play demonstrations of difficult conversations. Hearing the techniques applied helps you understand the language patterns and tone. Only 45 minutes—highly recommended for auditory learners.

Tools: Practice Q&A with peers before your Week 12 presentation. Run through your content, then have peers ask challenging questions. Record it on video if possible—watching yourself reveals habits you don't notice in the moment (saying "um," looking down, defensive body language).

Record yourself presenting to assess executive presence: Do you maintain eye contact? How's your vocal variety—are you monotone or dynamic? Do you appear confident or nervous? What's your pace—too fast, too slow, or appropriate?

Audit your digital footprint: Google yourself right now. What comes up? That's your digital appearance. If there's nothing, you need to build professional presence. If there's inappropriate content, you need to clean it up.

Which resource will you start with? Hewlett is the most accessible entry point. Coombs is most academic but most rigorous. Stone et al. is most comprehensive for difficult conversations.

## High-Stakes Communication in Vietnamese Context

### Executive Presence Adaptations

**Gravitas in Vietnamese culture:**
- Balance confidence with humility
- Show respect for hierarchy while demonstrating expertise
- Inclusiveness includes deference to seniority

**Communication adaptations:**
- Indirect communication can be culturally appropriate
- "From my perspective" shows respect while expressing views
- Active listening especially important across hierarchical differences

**Appearance considerations:**
- Vietnamese business culture still tends toward formality
- Authenticity balanced with cultural expectations
- Physical presence highly valued in relationship-building

### Crisis Communication Cultural Factors

- Face-saving is critical—protect both your face and others'
- Group harmony often prioritized over individual accountability
- SCCT still applies, but tone requires cultural calibration

### Difficult Conversations Cultural Nuances

- Third Story particularly important in hierarchical contexts
- Separating intent from impact helps navigate face concerns
- Tempered speech aligns with Vietnamese communication norms

<speaker-notes>
This slide addresses the critical question: How do these Western-developed frameworks apply in Vietnamese cultural context?

Executive Presence in Vietnamese culture requires balancing confidence with humility. Western executive presence often emphasizes assertiveness and self-promotion. Vietnamese executive presence values demonstrated competence combined with modesty.

Gravitas in Vietnamese context means showing respect for hierarchy while still demonstrating expertise. When speaking to someone senior, you maintain deference while contributing your knowledge. This is the "confidence + inclusiveness" principle adapted for hierarchical culture.

Communication adaptations: Indirect communication isn't a weakness in Vietnamese context—it's often culturally appropriate. The frameworks we learned today (Third Story, "from my perspective") actually align well with Vietnamese communication norms because they avoid direct confrontation while still addressing substance.

Active listening is especially important across hierarchical differences. When a senior person speaks, listening attentively and asking clarifying questions (rather than immediately asserting your view) shows both respect and engagement.

Appearance: Vietnamese business culture still tends toward formality more than Western startups. The "authenticity over formality" shift is happening, but more slowly. Understand your specific organizational context. Traditional companies still value formal dress; tech startups are more casual.

Crisis Communication cultural factors: Face-saving is critical in Vietnamese culture. When applying SCCT, you must protect both your own face and others' face. This doesn't mean avoiding responsibility—it means how you communicate responsibility matters enormously.

For example, if a team member makes a mistake, you don't publicly blame them (destroys their face). Instead, you take collective responsibility: "As a team, we should have caught this." Then address the issue privately with the individual.

Group harmony is often prioritized over individual accountability. SCCT still applies—you must match response to attribution—but the tone requires cultural calibration. Rebuild strategy in Vietnamese context might emphasize collective learning rather than individual fault.

Difficult Conversations cultural nuances: Third Story is particularly valuable in hierarchical contexts because it starts from neutral ground rather than asserting your version or their version. This protects face for everyone involved.

Separating intent from impact helps navigate face concerns. Instead of saying "You made me look bad" (attacks their intent), say "When the deadline was missed, I felt concerned about our team's reputation" (describes impact without attributing malicious intent).

Tempered speech aligns perfectly with Vietnamese communication norms. Vietnamese culture already uses indirect language and avoids absolutes. The techniques we learned today (avoiding "always" and "never," using "I felt" rather than "You did") are culturally appropriate adaptations.

The key insight: These frameworks aren't culturally rigid. They're adaptable to different cultural contexts. The core principles (emotional regulation, respect, systematic response) are universal. The specific language and tone adapt to cultural norms.

How do these cultural adaptations resonate with your experience? What additional cultural factors should we consider when applying these frameworks in Vietnamese business contexts?
