# Week 1 Tutorial: Communication Self-Assessment Workshop

**Course:** BCI2AU Business Communication
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Assessment Connection:** Builds self-awareness for portfolio improvement — knowing your gaps enables targeted revision of written work (Business Memo Week 4, Persuasive Proposal Week 7, Executive Summary Week 10) and presentation preparation (Group Presentation Week 12). Directly supports Learning Objective 6: Evaluate personal communication effectiveness through self-reflection.

## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**
- **Shannon-Weaver Model:** Communication flows from source through encoder, channel (with noise), decoder, to destination — useful for diagnosing why messages fail
- **MKS Model:** Communication competence requires Motivation (desire + confidence), Knowledge (understanding frameworks), and Skills (execution ability) — all three dimensions must be present
- **Four Leadership Strategies:** Short words, sticky metaphors, humanized data, mission as mantra

**What good work looks like:**
- Honest self-assessment with specific evidence (not vague statements like "I'm not confident")
- Clear identification of which MKS dimension is your biggest gap
- Concrete action plan with measurable steps

**Full rubric:** See Assessment Handbook, Written Communication Rubric — criteria like "Content & Strategy" and "Professional Tone" improve when you know your personal gaps

## Main Activity: MKS Self-Assessment and Development Plan

**Assessment Connection:** This self-assessment directly prepares you for success on ALL portfolio pieces. The Written Communication Rubric (Assessment Handbook) evaluates "Content & Strategy," "Organization," "Clarity & Concision," and "Professional Tone." Knowing which MKS dimension is YOUR gap allows you to:
- **Focus revision efforts** where you need them most
- **Request targeted feedback** from peers and instructor
- **Track improvement** across multiple submissions
- **Build confidence** for the Group Presentation (Week 12)

For example: If your gap is **Knowledge**, you'll prioritize learning frameworks (Pyramid Principle, SCQA) before Week 4 Memo. If your gap is **Skills**, you'll practice writing and speaking repeatedly. If your gap is **Motivation**, you'll focus on building confidence through low-stakes practice.

**The Task:**
Complete a structured self-assessment using the MKS framework, then create a personal communication development plan that identifies your gap and proposes specific actions to address it this semester.

**Deliverable:**
A 1-page Communication Development Plan containing:
1. MKS ratings (1-5 scale) with specific evidence for each dimension
2. Your primary gap area with concrete examples from your experience
3. Three actionable steps you will take this semester to improve

**Success Criteria:** (supports Written Communication Rubric)
- Self-assessment shows honest reflection with specific examples (not vague generalizations like "I'm bad at writing")
- Gap identification connects clearly to MKS dimensions with evidence
- Action plan includes measurable, achievable steps within your control

**Resources:**

### Self-Assessment Questions

**Motivation (Desire + Confidence)**
- How do you feel before giving a presentation? (1 = dread it, 5 = excited)
- Do you volunteer to speak in meetings or class? Why or why not?
- What communication situations do you avoid? What does that tell you?
- When do you feel most/least confident communicating?

**Knowledge (Understanding what works)**
- Could you explain how to structure a business memo right now? A persuasive proposal?
- Do you know when to use direct vs. indirect communication approaches?
- Can you name three persuasion techniques and when to apply them?
- Do you understand cultural differences in Vietnamese vs. Western business communication?

**Skills (Ability to perform)**
- **Attentiveness:** How well do you listen without planning your response?
- **Composure:** How do you handle unexpected questions or challenges?
- **Coordination:** Can you manage a group discussion or meeting flow?
- **Expressiveness:** Is your writing clear on first read? Is your speaking engaging?

At the end of the session, 4-6 students will share their development plans. Be prepared to:
- State your primary gap area and explain why
- Share one action you plan to take this semester
- Explain how addressing this gap will improve your written or oral work

⚠️ **Participation:** You must complete the development plan template to participate in sharing. This is formative work — honest self-assessment benefits YOU, not the grade.
