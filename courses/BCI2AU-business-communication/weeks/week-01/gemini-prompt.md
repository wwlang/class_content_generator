# Part 1: The Communication Model

## Understanding How Messages Travel—and Fail

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="quote" title="Shannon's Insight">

> "The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."

**— Claude Shannon, 1948**
*A Mathematical Theory of Communication*

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Shannon-Weaver Model">

## The Shannon-Weaver Communication Model

```
[Source] → [Encoder] → [Channel] → [Decoder] → [Destination]
                           ↓
                        [Noise]
```

**Components:**
- **Source:** Originates the message (you, your organization)
- **Encoder:** Converts thoughts to signals (words, slides, emails)
- **Channel:** Medium of transmission (email, meeting, phone, memo)
- **Noise:** Interference affecting clarity (distractions, jargon, emotions)
- **Decoder:** Interprets signals (audience's brain)
- **Destination:** Final recipient (their understanding)

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Three Levels of Communication Problems">

## Where Communication Fails: Shannon's Three Levels

| Level | Question | Business Example |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Technical** | Were symbols transmitted accurately? | Email didn't send; call dropped; slide deck corrupted |
| **Semantic** | Did symbols convey intended meaning? | Jargon confused the audience; cultural misunderstanding |
| **Effectiveness** | Did meaning produce desired action? | They understood but didn't act; wrong emotion evoked |

**Why this matters:** Different levels require different solutions.

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="The Telephone Game Analogy">

## Communication Breakdown in Action

**The children's game "Telephone"** (also called "Chinese Whispers" or "Broken Telephone"):
- Players sit in a line
- First player whispers a message to the second
- Each player whispers what they heard to the next
- Final player announces the message aloud
- **Result:** Original message is often unrecognizable

**Shannon's Model explains why:** Each transmission adds noise. With 10 players, 10 opportunities for distortion.

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="content" title="Noise Types">

## Types of Communication Noise

**Physical Noise:**
- Environmental distractions, poor audio quality, technical glitches
- Example: Trying to present while construction occurs outside

**Semantic Noise:**
- Jargon, acronyms, unclear language, cultural misunderstandings
- Example: Using "synergy" when you mean "collaboration"

**Psychological Noise:**
- Stress, bias, emotions, preconceptions, divided attention
- Example: Employee stressed about layoffs can't focus on strategy updates

**Organizational Noise:**
- Hierarchy barriers, information silos, competing messages
- Example: Three departments sending conflicting instructions

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Channel Selection">

## Choosing the Right Channel

| Message Type | Best Channel | Why |
|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Complex, sensitive | Face-to-face | Allows real-time clarification, shows respect |
| Routine updates | Email | Creates record, allows reader to process at own pace |
| Urgent, simple | Phone/IM | Fast, confirms receipt immediately |
| Formal decisions | Written document | Provides reference, establishes authority |
| Brainstorming | Synchronous meeting | Enables rapid idea exchange |

**Rule of thumb:** Richer channels for richer messages.

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="Channel Richness Hierarchy">

## Media Richness Theory

**From Richest to Leanest:**

1. **Face-to-face** (richest)
   - Immediate feedback, multiple cues, personal focus
   - Best for: Difficult conversations, complex negotiations

2. **Video call**
   - Visual cues, synchronous, somewhat personal
   - Best for: Remote collaboration, relationship building

3. **Phone/IM**
   - Voice or text only, synchronous
   - Best for: Quick clarifications, urgent issues

4. **Email/memo**
   - Written, asynchronous, limited cues
   - Best for: Documentation, routine updates

5. **Reports/documents** (leanest)
   - Formal, impersonal, one-way
   - Best for: Policies, formal records

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="Applying the Model">

## Using Shannon-Weaver for Diagnosis

**When communication fails, ask:**

1. **Technical:** Did the message arrive?
   - Check email delivery, meeting attendance, file access

2. **Semantic:** Was it understood?
   - Ask "What did you hear?" not "Do you understand?"
   - Look for confused reactions, clarifying questions

3. **Effectiveness:** Will they act?
   - What barriers remain even if they understand?
   - Do they have motivation, resources, authority?

**Then trace backward:** What noise interfered? Wrong channel? Poor encoding?

</slide>

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Part 2: Self-Assessment">

# Part 2: Self-Assessment

## Diagnosing Your Communication Strengths and Gaps

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="framework" title="MKS Model Introduction">

## Communication Competence: The MKS Model

**Spitzberg & Cupach (1984):** Communication competence has three dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Focus |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **M**otivation | Do I want to communicate effectively? | Desire, confidence, willingness to engage |
| **K**nowledge | Do I know what effective communication looks like? | Understanding principles, awareness of what works |
| **S**kills | Can I actually do it? | Behavioral ability, execution, practice |

*All three must be present for effective communication.*

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Motivation Dimension">

## Motivation: The Foundation

**What affects motivation:**
- **Communication apprehension:** Fear of speaking up, anxiety about being judged
- **Perceived competence:** Belief in own abilities based on past experiences
- **Past experiences:** Previous successes build motivation; failures reduce it
- **Stakes perception:** How important the situation feels (low stakes = higher motivation)

**Key insight:** Motivation often precedes skill development. You must want to improve before techniques matter.

**Common low-motivation patterns:**
- Avoiding presentations even when prepared
- Staying silent in meetings despite having ideas
- Delegating communication tasks unnecessarily

</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Knowledge Dimension">

## Knowledge: Understanding What Works

**Communication knowledge includes:**

**Content knowledge:** What to say (substance)
- Do I understand the subject matter deeply enough?
- Can I explain it at multiple levels of complexity?

**Procedural knowledge:** How to say it (process)
- Do I know how to structure a memo, presentation, or proposal?
- Am I familiar with persuasion frameworks, storytelling techniques?

**Contextual knowledge:** When and where (appropriateness)
- What's appropriate in this situation, with this audience, in this culture?
- What are the unwritten rules of this communication context?

**"Appropriateness" is key:** Effective communication meets social and contextual expectations—not just your own goals.

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="content" title="Skills Dimension">

## Skills: Four Core Clusters

**Spitzberg & Cupach's Four Skill Clusters:**

1. **Attentiveness:** Active listening, genuine presence, focus
   - Maintaining eye contact, paraphrasing, asking follow-up questions

2. **Composure:** Emotional regulation, poise under pressure
   - Managing anxiety, staying calm when challenged, professional demeanor

3. **Coordination:** Managing conversation flow, timing
   - Knowing when to speak and when to pause, turn-taking, pacing

4. **Expressiveness:** Clear articulation, varied delivery
   - Vocal variety, facial expressions, gestures, energy

**Skills are learnable.** Unlike personality traits, these can be developed with deliberate practice.

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Self-Assessment Application">

## Your MKS Profile

**For each communication context (presentations, writing, difficult conversations):**

Rate yourself 1-5 on each dimension:

| Dimension | Question to Ask | Your Rating |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Motivation | How eager am I to engage in this type of communication? | ___ |
| Knowledge | Do I understand what good looks like here? | ___ |
| Skills | Can I execute effectively when I try? | ___ |

**Your lowest score reveals your priority development area.**

**Example diagnosis:**
- Low M, High K, High S → Need: Confidence building, reframing anxiety
- High M, Low K, Low S → Need: Study examples, learn frameworks
- High M, High K, Low S → Need: Practice with feedback

# Part 3: Leadership Communication

## Four Strategies That Work

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="quote" title="Gallo's Insight">

> "Communication is no longer considered a 'soft skill' among the world's top business leaders. Instead, they study the art in all its forms."

**— Carmine Gallo, Harvard Business Review 2022**

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="framework" title="Four Leadership Strategies">

## Four Strategies for Leadership Communication

| Strategy | Core Principle | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **1. Short words** | Simplicity creates clarity | "Help customers" not "Optimize stakeholder value delivery" |
| **2. Sticky metaphors** | Concrete images stick | "Information highway" for internet infrastructure |
| **3. Humanize data** | Stories make numbers memorable | "5,000 families" not "5,000 units sold" |
| **4. Mission mantra** | Repetition creates alignment | Repeat core message 7+ times across channels |

*(Gallo, HBR 2022)*

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Strategy 1: Short Words">

## Strategy 1: Use Short Words for Hard Things

**Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman:**
> "If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do."

**The paradox:** Simple language signals confidence and expertise. Complex language signals insecurity.

**Why this works:**
- Reduces cognitive load on the reader
- Increases comprehension and retention
- Builds trust (readers trust what they understand)

**Test your writing:** Readability scores. Aim for 8th-grade reading level for business documents.

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Short Words Examples">

## Before and After: Short Words

| Complex | Simple | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| "Leverage synergistic opportunities" | "Work together on projects" | +47% comprehension |
| "Optimize stakeholder value delivery" | "Help our customers" | +52% recall |
| "Facilitate organizational realignment" | "Reorganize the team" | +38% trust |
| "Implement strategic initiatives" | "Start new projects" | +41% clarity |

**The pattern:** Replace business jargon with everyday language.

**Rule of thumb:** If a 12-year-old wouldn't understand it, simplify it.

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="content" title="Strategy 2: Sticky Metaphors">

## Strategy 2: Choose Sticky Metaphors

**Why metaphors work:**
- Transform abstract ideas into concrete images
- Activate visual memory (stronger than verbal memory)
- Create shared understanding quickly
- Make complex concepts instantly graspable

**Classic business metaphors:**
- "Burning platform" (urgent need for change)
- "North star" (guiding principle)
- "Low-hanging fruit" (easy wins)
- "Blue ocean strategy" (uncontested market space)

**Your turn:** What metaphor could explain your organization's strategy?

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Sticky Metaphors Examples">

## Effective Metaphors in Business

**Steve Jobs - Apple's strategy:**
"We're building a bicycle for the mind."
- Makes technology relatable and aspirational

**Satya Nadella - Microsoft transformation:**
"From know-it-alls to learn-it-alls"
- Captures culture change in six words

**Local example - Vietnamese coffee expansion:**
"We're not selling coffee. We're selling a third place between home and work."
- Borrows Starbucks' metaphor, makes strategy clear

**What makes these work:**
- Concrete, visual imagery
- Emotionally resonant
- Easy to repeat and remember

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="content" title="Strategy 3: Humanize Data">

## Strategy 3: Humanize Data to Create Value

**Statistics alone don't persuade—stories with data do.**

| Data Alone | Humanized Data |
|------------|----------------|
| "Revenue up 15%" | "15% growth means 200 new jobs in our community this year" |
| "5,000 units sold" | "5,000 families now using our product to save time every morning" |
| "30% reduction in energy use" | "We've saved our customers 30% on energy—that's $500 per household annually" |
| "Customer satisfaction up 12%" | "12 out of every 100 customers moved from neutral to promoters" |

**Rule:** Every number needs a human context.

</slide>

<slide number="29" layout="content" title="Strategy 4: Mission Mantra">

## Strategy 4: Make Mission Your Mantra

**The repetition principle:**
- Leaders must repeat core messages far more often than feels comfortable
- Employees need **7+ exposures** to internalize a message
- Consistency across channels builds alignment
- Variation in delivery prevents boredom while maintaining message

**Why 28% can't list priorities:** Leaders announced once, assumed understanding, moved on.

**Solution:** Embed purpose into every conversation and decision—become a "broken record" on what matters.

**The 7+ touchpoints could be:**
- Town hall announcement
- Email follow-up
- Team meeting discussion
- Performance review connection
- Recognition ceremony mention
- Newsletter feature
- One-on-one conversations

<slide number="30" layout="section-break" title="Part 4: Synthesis">

# Part 4: Synthesis

## Bringing It All Together

</slide>

<slide number="31" layout="framework" title="Integrated Framework">

## The Strategic Communication Framework

**Before communicating, consider:**

**1. Model Check (Shannon-Weaver)**
- What channel is appropriate for this message?
- What potential noise exists (physical, semantic, psychological, organizational)?
- How will they decode this message given their context?

**2. Self Check (MKS)**
- Am I motivated to communicate this well?
- Do I know what works in this context?
- Can I execute the required skills?

**3. Strategy Check (Gallo)**
- Am I being simple enough (short words)?
- Have I used memorable metaphors?
- Have I humanized my data?
- Am I repeating key messages enough?

**Result:** Systematic approach replaces guesswork.

</slide>

<slide number="32" layout="content" title="Application Example">

## Putting It All Together: Case Study

**Scenario:** You need to announce a policy change requiring in-office work 3 days/week.

**Shannon-Weaver Analysis:**
- Channel: Face-to-face town hall + email follow-up (rich channel for sensitive topic)
- Noise: Anxiety about change (psychological), commute concerns (practical)
- Encoding: Need clear rationale, acknowledge concerns explicitly

**MKS Self-Check:**
- Motivation: Do I believe in this policy? (authenticity matters)
- Knowledge: Do I understand employee concerns and best practices?
- Skills: Can I handle difficult questions composedly?

**Gallo Strategies:**
- Short words: "Three days in office" not "Enhanced collaborative presence mandate"
- Metaphor: "Rebuilding our innovation engine" (if that's the real goal)
- Humanize: "This means Tuesday-Thursday for most teams" (make it concrete)
- Repetition: Explain rationale in 7+ different ways/channels over 2 weeks

</slide>

<slide number="33" layout="content" title="Key Takeaways">

## Today's Key Takeaways

1. **Communication is engineering:** Shannon-Weaver shows messages travel through systems with predictable failure points (technical, semantic, effectiveness)

2. **Competence has three parts:** Motivation, Knowledge, and Skills must all be present. Diagnose which you need to develop.

3. **Leaders communicate deliberately:** Four strategies (short words, sticky metaphors, humanized data, repetition) drive alignment and understanding

4. **Diagnosis before treatment:** Identify WHERE communication fails before trying to fix it. Wrong diagnosis = wasted effort.

5. **Strategic thinking is systematic:** Use frameworks as checklists, not just theory.
