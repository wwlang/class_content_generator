## Slide 1: Hook

# Only 28%

**of executives and managers can list three strategic priorities of their organization**

*(MIT Sloan Research, Lancefield 2022)*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Wait for silence, then reveal the number
- Let it sink in before explaining

**Key Points:**
- This isn't a memory problem—it's a communication failure
- If leaders can't communicate strategy clearly, how can employees execute it?
- This gap represents billions in wasted organizational effort

**Example:**
- Think of a company announcement you've received—could you summarize the key message in one sentence?

**Check Understanding:**
- "How many of you could confidently explain your last employer's top three priorities?"

**Transition:**
- "This course will ensure you never contribute to that 72% communication gap..."

## Slide 5: Roadmap

# Today's Journey

1. **The Communication Model** (20 min)
   *How messages travel—and fail*

2. **Self-Assessment** (25 min)
   *Diagnosing your strengths and gaps*

3. **Leadership Communication** (25 min)
   *Four strategies that work*

4. **Synthesis** (20 min)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Four clear segments, one break in the middle

**Key Points:**
- First two segments: foundational theory (models)
- Second two segments: practical application (strategies)
- Each segment ends with an activity or discussion

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with the question that launched communication theory..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->
## Slide 6: Segment 1 Intro

# Part 1: The Communication Model
## Understanding How Messages Travel—and Fail

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Before we can improve communication, we need a shared vocabulary for discussing it"

**Key Points:**
- Communication theory began with a practical problem: how to transmit telephone signals reliably
- The solution became the foundation for ALL communication study
- This model helps diagnose why communication fails

**Transition:**
- "In 1948, a Bell Labs engineer asked a simple question..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->
## Slide 7: Shannon Quote

> "The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."

**— Claude Shannon, 1948**
*A Mathematical Theory of Communication*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Shannon wasn't thinking about business meetings—he was engineering telephone systems
- But his insight applies to every message you'll ever send

**Key Points:**
- "Reproducing... exactly or approximately" = perfect understanding is rare
- "Selected at another point" = sender chooses what to transmit
- The gap between what you mean and what they understand = the communication problem

**Example:**
- Think of the game "telephone"—that's Shannon's problem in miniature

**Transition:**
- "Shannon created a model to visualize this problem..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->
## Slide 8: Shannon-Weaver Model

## The Shannon-Weaver Communication Model

```
[Source] → [Encoder] → [Channel] → [Decoder] → [Destination]
                           ↓
                        [Noise]
```

**Components:**
- **Source:** Originates the message (you)
- **Encoder:** Converts thoughts to signals (words, slides)
- **Channel:** Medium of transmission (email, meeting, phone)
- **Noise:** Interference affecting clarity (distractions, jargon)
- **Decoder:** Interprets signals (audience)
- **Destination:** Final recipient (their understanding)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Draw this on the whiteboard as you explain each component

**Key Points:**
- Source ≠ Encoder: Your thoughts aren't your words
- Channel choice matters: wrong channel = message failure
- Noise is everywhere: physical, semantic, psychological

**Example:**
- Email (channel) with technical jargon (noise) sent to non-technical audience = message fails at decoder

**Check Understanding:**
- "What channel would you choose to deliver bad news to an employee? Why?"

**Transition:**
- "This model reveals three levels where communication can fail..."

---

## Slide 9: Three Levels of Communication Problems

## Where Communication Fails

| Level | Question | Business Example |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Technical** | Were the symbols transmitted accurately? | Email didn't send; call dropped |
| **Semantic** | Did symbols convey intended meaning? | Jargon confused the audience |
| **Effectiveness** | Did meaning produce desired action? | They understood but didn't act |

**Most business failures happen at the effectiveness level**

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Technical problems are easy to fix—semantic and effectiveness problems are harder"

**Key Points:**
- Technical: Engineering problem (usually solved by technology)
- Semantic: Language problem (word choice, clarity, cultural differences)
- Effectiveness: Persuasion problem (motivation, relevance, credibility)

**Example:**
- Your strategy email sent successfully (technical ✓), was understood (semantic ✓), but nobody changed behavior (effectiveness ✗)

**Transition:**
- "Let's apply this to a real situation..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->
## Slide 10: Case Study - Email Communication

## Case: The Ignored Strategy Update

**Scenario:**
CEO sends monthly strategy email to 5,000 employees. Read rate: 23%. Action rate: 3%.

**Apply Shannon-Weaver:**
- **Channel:** Email (appropriate for info sharing, poor for action)
- **Noise:** Inbox overload, competing priorities, passive subject line
- **Decoder issue:** Employees don't know how to translate strategy to their role

**Discussion:** What would you change?

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This is a real pattern—companies send strategy emails and wonder why nothing changes"

**Key Points:**
- Channel selection: Email is passive; town halls + team discussions are active
- Noise reduction: Better subject lines, shorter messages, visual hierarchy
- Decoder support: Include "what this means for your team" section

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Line or Zalo groups have higher engagement than email for many teams

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's one change you'd recommend to this CEO?"

**Transition:**
- "The model tells us where problems occur—but how do you assess YOUR communication?"

---

<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->
## Slide 11: Segment 2 Intro

# Part 2: Self-Assessment
## Diagnosing Your Strengths and Gaps

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Knowing models isn't enough—you need to know yourself"

**Key Points:**
- Communication competence isn't a trait—it's a skill you can develop
- But first you need to know where to focus
- This framework gives you a diagnostic tool

**Transition:**
- "Communication researchers have identified three dimensions that determine competence..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->
## Slide 12: MKS Model Introduction

## The MKS Model of Communication Competence

**M**otivation + **K**nowledge + **S**kills = Competence

| Dimension | Question | If Low... |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Motivation** | Do you want to communicate well? | Even perfect technique won't help |
| **Knowledge** | Do you know what to do? | Good intentions produce poor results |
| **Skills** | Can you perform the behavior? | Knowledge stays theoretical |

*(Spitzberg & Cupach, 1984 — 2,207 citations)*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Think of someone who's a great communicator. They have all three."

**Key Points:**
- Motivation = desire + confidence (affective)
- Knowledge = understanding appropriate behavior (cognitive)
- Skills = ability to execute (behavioral)
- ALL THREE must be present—high knowledge with low motivation produces no change

**Example:**
- Manager who knows how to give feedback (K) but avoids difficult conversations (low M) = poor communication

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which dimension do you think is YOUR biggest gap?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's unpack each dimension..."

---

## Slide 13: Motivation Dimension

## Motivation: The Desire and Confidence to Communicate

**Motivation includes:**
- **Desire:** Do you want to engage in this communication?
- **Confidence:** Do you believe you can do it well?
- **Anxiety management:** Can you control nervousness?

**Warning Signs of Low Motivation:**
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Rushing through presentations to "get it over with"
- Delegating communication tasks

**Key insight:** Motivation often precedes skill development—students must want to improve before techniques matter.

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Motivation is the most overlooked dimension"

**Key Points:**
- Low motivation ≠ laziness; often it's anxiety or past negative experiences
- Confidence comes from practice, not just knowledge
- Communication apprehension affects ~20% of people (McCroskey, 1977)

**Example:**
- Student who knows presentation structure but still avoids speaking = motivation gap
- Solution: Start with low-stakes practice, build confidence gradually

**Transition:**
- "Once you're motivated, you need knowledge of what works..."

---

## Slide 14: Knowledge Dimension

## Knowledge: Understanding What Works

**Communication knowledge includes:**
- **Rules:** What's expected in this context?
- **Strategies:** What approaches achieve my goal?
- **Audience awareness:** What do they need from me?

**Knowledge types:**
- **Procedural:** How to structure a presentation
- **Conditional:** When to use which approach
- **Contextual:** What's appropriate in Vietnamese vs. American business culture

**This course builds your knowledge systematically**

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Knowledge without skill is useless, but skill without knowledge is dangerous"

**Key Points:**
- Rules: Professional email format, meeting norms, presentation structure
- Strategies: When to be direct vs. indirect, how to build credibility
- Audience: Cultural norms, power dynamics, individual preferences

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Knowledge of hierarchical communication norms prevents embarrassing mistakes

**Transition:**
- "Knowledge tells you what to do—skills let you actually do it..."

---

## Slide 15: Skills Dimension

## Skills: The Ability to Perform

**Four core skill clusters:**

| Cluster | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Attentiveness** | Active listening, presence | Eye contact, follow-up questions |
| **Composure** | Emotional regulation, poise | Handling tough Q&A calmly |
| **Coordination** | Managing interaction flow | Knowing when to speak/listen |
| **Expressiveness** | Clear articulation | Vocal variety, precise language |

**Skills are developed through practice, not reading**

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Skills require repetition—you can't read your way to competence"

**Key Points:**
- Attentiveness: Most people listen to respond, not to understand
- Composure: Critical for high-stakes situations (Week 8)
- Coordination: Knowing when to take control vs. yield
- Expressiveness: Clarity + engagement

**Example:**
- Tutorial activities practice these clusters directly
- Group presentation will test all four

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick self-assessment: Which cluster is strongest? Weakest?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see how this applies to your communication..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->
## Slide 16: MKS Self-Assessment Activity

## Activity: Your MKS Profile

**Rate yourself 1-5 on each:**

| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Motivation | ___ | What makes you say that? |
| Knowledge | ___ | What do you know well? Gaps? |
| Skills | ___ | What can you do well? Struggle with? |

**Pair discussion (3 min):**
Share one strength and one gap with your partner.

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Take 2 minutes to rate yourself honestly—this is for your development"

**Key Points:**
- Honest self-assessment is the first step to improvement
- Focus on the GAP—that's where this course adds value
- No judgment—everyone has gaps

**Facilitation:**
- Walk around during pair discussion
- Listen for common themes to address later

**Transition:**
- "Now that you can assess yourself, let's look at what great communicators actually do..."

## Slide 17: Segment 3 Intro

# Part 3: Leadership Communication
## Four Strategies That Work

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "We've covered theory and self-assessment—now let's get practical"

**Key Points:**
- These strategies come from analysis of world-class communicators
- They're immediately applicable
- They work across cultures (with adaptation)

**Transition:**
- "Communication coach Carmine Gallo studied great leaders and found four patterns..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->
## Slide 18: Gallo Quote

> "If you cannot simplify a message and communicate it compellingly, believe me, you cannot get the masses to follow you."

**— Indira Nooyi, Former CEO of PepsiCo**

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Nooyi led 300,000 employees across 200 countries
- Her insight: Complexity kills leadership communication

**Key Points:**
- "Simplify" = not dumbing down, but clarifying
- "Compellingly" = not just clear, but memorable
- "Get the masses to follow" = effectiveness level (Shannon-Weaver)

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down the four strategies she and other great leaders use..."

---

<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->
## Slide 19: Four Leadership Communication Strategies

## Four Strategies for Leadership Communication

1. **Use short words to talk about hard things**
   *Clarity over complexity*

2. **Choose sticky metaphors**
   *Abstract → Concrete*

3. **Humanize data to create value**
   *Numbers → Narratives*

4. **Make mission your mantra**
   *Repetition for alignment*

*(Gallo, 2022)*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These four strategies are the 'secret' of great communicators"

**Key Points:**
- They work together—great communication uses all four
- Each addresses a different audience need
- They apply to writing AND speaking

**Example:**
- Steve Jobs introducing iPhone: Short words ("revolutionary"), metaphors ("like having the internet in your pocket"), humanized data ("1000 songs in your pocket"), repeated mission ("think different")

**Transition:**
- "Let's examine each strategy in detail..."

---

## Slide 20: Strategy 1 - Short Words

## Strategy 1: Use Short Words to Talk About Hard Things

**Why it works:**
- Long sentences create "cognitive strain" (Kahneman)
- Complex language signals LESS credibility, not more
- Short words are faster to process and easier to remember

**Daniel Kahneman's advice:**
> "If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do."

**Practical tip:** Use readability software (Hemingway Editor, Grammarly)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Counterintuitive: Complex language makes you seem LESS intelligent"

**Key Points:**
- Academic writing ≠ business writing
- Kahneman (Nobel Prize winner) studied this extensively
- Average sentence: 15-20 words max

**Example:**
- Bad: "We need to leverage our core competencies to synergistically optimize stakeholder value"
- Good: "We need to use our strengths to create more value for customers"

**Check Understanding:**
- "Rewrite this in your head: 'Pursuant to our discussion, I am writing to inform you...'"

**Transition:**
- "Short words get attention—metaphors make ideas stick..."

---

## Slide 21: Strategy 2 - Sticky Metaphors

## Strategy 2: Choose Sticky Metaphors

**Why it works:**
- Metaphors create vivid mental pictures
- Pictures are remembered better than abstractions
- Comparison = instant understanding

**Examples:**
- "Data is the new oil" (valuable, needs refining)
- "Culture eats strategy for breakfast" (culture is more powerful)
- "The information superhighway" (internet = familiar road concept)

**Your task:** Develop signature metaphors for key concepts in your work

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The best communicators have 'signature metaphors' they use repeatedly"

**Key Points:**
- Metaphors translate unfamiliar → familiar
- Good metaphors are simple, visual, and memorable
- Bad metaphors are clichés ("low-hanging fruit")

**Example:**
- Vietnamese business context: "Bánh mì approach" (layers working together) for integrated strategy

**Transition:**
- "Metaphors make ideas sticky—but data makes them credible..."

---

## Slide 22: Strategy 3 - Humanize Data

## Strategy 3: Humanize Data to Create Value

**Why it works:**
- Statistics alone don't persuade—stories with data do
- Human brains are wired for narrative, not numbers
- Data provides credibility; story provides motivation

**Example transformation:**
- **Data only:** "Our app has 10 million users"
- **Humanized:** "10 million people trusted us to help them sleep better—that's more than the population of Ho Chi Minh City"

**Rule:** Pair every important statistic with a human story

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Data without context is meaningless—context without data is unconvincing"

**Key Points:**
- Connect numbers to human impact
- Use comparisons people understand (city populations, time equivalents)
- Stories make data memorable

**Example:**
- "Our error rate is 0.01%" (meaningless)
- "Out of 10,000 orders, 9,999 arrive perfectly" (concrete)
- "That one error could be your customer's wedding cake" (human stakes)

**Transition:**
- "Stories make data memorable—repetition makes messages permanent..."

---

## Slide 23: Strategy 4 - Mission as Mantra

## Strategy 4: Make Mission Your Mantra

**Why it works:**
- Repetition creates organizational alignment
- People need to hear a message 7+ times to internalize it
- Leaders must be "broken records" on key messages

**Amazon example:**
- Jeff Bezos: "Customer obsession" in every speech, memo, meeting
- Day 1 mentality repeated for 25+ years
- Employees can recite core principles

**Your task:** What's your "one thing" that deserves constant repetition?

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Great leaders sound like broken records—on purpose"

**Key Points:**
- Consistency builds trust
- Repetition embeds values
- Variation in HOW you say it, not WHAT you say

**Example:**
- Vietnamese context: Vingroup's consistent messaging around "Vietnamese excellence"

**Check Understanding:**
- "What message would you want YOUR team to repeat back to you?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's see all four strategies in action..."

<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->
## Slide 24: Application Exercise

## Activity: Strategy Identification

**Read this excerpt from a CEO announcement:**

> "Last quarter, we served 2.3 million customers—imagine Ho Chi Minh City's entire District 1 choosing us, twice over. Our mission hasn't changed: making every home smarter. Smart homes. Smarter lives. That's who we are."

**Identify:**
1. Which strategies are used?
2. Where could it be improved?
3. What Shannon-Weaver "noise" might still affect it?

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Let's apply what we've learned to real communication"

**Key Points:**
- Strategy 1: Short words throughout
- Strategy 2: District 1 metaphor
- Strategy 3: 2.3 million humanized
- Strategy 4: Mission repeated

**Discussion:**
- Could add: What does "smarter" mean specifically? (semantic noise)
- Channel consideration: Is this email, video, town hall?

**Transition:**
- "Now let's pull everything together..."

- Great communication = Model awareness + Self-knowledge + Strategies
- You'll use these frameworks in every assessment
- Practice starts in today's tutorial

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect everything we've learned..."
