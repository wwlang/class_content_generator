# Communication Strategy Foundations

<speaker-notes>
Welcome students to Business Communication. Today we explore the foundations of strategic communication—the deliberate, purposeful approach that distinguishes effective business communicators from everyone else.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="2" layout="big-number" title="Hook: The Communication Gap">

# 28%

**of executives and managers can list three strategic priorities of their organization**

*(MIT Sloan Research, Lancefield 2022)*

<speaker-notes>
This statistic often surprises students. It means 72% of leaders cannot articulate their own organization's strategy. The implication: billions in wasted effort because people don't understand what they're supposed to be doing. This course ensures students never contribute to that 72% gap. Common student reactions include disbelief and curiosity about why it's so low.

<slide number="3" layout="content" title="Learning Objectives">

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the components of the Shannon-Weaver communication model and apply it to diagnose communication breakdowns
2. **Apply** the MKS framework for self-assessment of communication competence
3. **Identify** and use four evidence-based strategies for effective leadership communication
4. **Analyze** communication failures systematically using theoretical frameworks

<speaker-notes>
These objectives are testable—students will see similar questions on the Week 11 quiz. "Explain" means they should be able to teach these concepts to someone else. "Apply" means using the MKS framework on their own communication style. By the end of today, students can diagnose why meetings fail using systematic frameworks rather than vague complaints.

<slide number="4" layout="framework" title="Assessment Connection">

## How This Prepares You

| Assessment | Due | Today's Relevance |
|------------|-----|-------------------|
| Business Memo | Week 4 | Audience analysis foundation; Shannon model helps choose right channel |
| Persuasive Proposal | Week 7 | Strategic mindset; leadership communication strategies apply directly |
| Group Presentation | Week 12 | Communication planning skills; self-assessment identifies improvement areas |

**This week's frameworks appear in every assessment rubric**

<speaker-notes>
Strategic communication mindset is rubric criterion #1 on all written work. Self-assessment skills help students identify weaknesses to improve before submission. These frameworks provide shared vocabulary for peer feedback sessions. The Business Memo in Week 4 specifically requires audience analysis using concepts from today's Shannon model (noise, channel selection, encoding).

# Part 1: The Communication Model

## Understanding How Messages Travel—and Fail

<speaker-notes>
Before improving communication, we need shared vocabulary for discussing it. Communication theory originated from an engineering problem: how to transmit telephone signals reliably across noisy lines. The solution became the foundation for studying ALL communication—business, personal, and organizational. This model helps diagnose exactly where communication fails.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="quote" title="Shannon's Insight">

> "The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."

**— Claude Shannon, 1948**
*A Mathematical Theory of Communication*

<speaker-notes>
Shannon was an engineer at Bell Labs solving practical telephone problems, not a business theorist. Yet his insight applies universally. The phrase "exactly or approximately" acknowledges that perfect understanding is rare—there's always some gap between what you mean and what others understand. This gap is THE communication problem we're learning to minimize.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="8" layout="framework" title="Shannon-Weaver Model">

## The Shannon-Weaver Communication Model

```
[Source] → [Encoder] → [Channel] → [Decoder] → [Destination]
                           ↓
                        [Noise]
```

**Components:**
- **Source:** Originates the message (you, your organization)
- **Encoder:** Converts thoughts to signals (words, slides, emails)
- **Channel:** Medium of transmission (email, meeting, phone, memo)
- **Noise:** Interference affecting clarity (distractions, jargon, emotions)
- **Decoder:** Interprets signals (audience's brain)
- **Destination:** Final recipient (their understanding)

<speaker-notes>
A whiteboard diagram can help here—drawing each component as you explain shows the flow visually. Key insight: Source ≠ Encoder. Your thoughts aren't the same as your words. Channel choice matters enormously: sending bad news by email when a conversation is needed equals message failure. Noise exists everywhere: physical (loud room), semantic (unclear jargon), psychological (stress, bias). Example: An email (channel) containing technical acronyms (noise) sent to a non-technical audience fails at the decoder stage.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Three Levels of Communication Problems">

## Where Communication Fails: Shannon's Three Levels

| Level | Question | Business Example |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Technical** | Were symbols transmitted accurately? | Email didn't send; call dropped; slide deck corrupted |
| **Semantic** | Did symbols convey intended meaning? | Jargon confused the audience; cultural misunderstanding |
| **Effectiveness** | Did meaning produce desired action? | They understood but didn't act; wrong emotion evoked |

**Why this matters:** Different levels require different solutions.

<speaker-notes>
Shannon identified three distinct levels where communication can break down. Most business frustrations occur at the semantic or effectiveness levels—the email arrived, but either the reader misunderstood (semantic) or understood but ignored it (effectiveness). Students often conflate these levels. This framework helps diagnose the actual problem before attempting a fix. Technical problems need IT solutions. Semantic problems need clearer encoding. Effectiveness problems need persuasion strategies (Week 4 and 7).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="10" layout="content" title="The Telephone Game Analogy">

## Communication Breakdown in Action

**The children's game "Telephone"** (also called "Chinese Whispers" or "Broken Telephone"):
- Players sit in a line
- First player whispers a message to the second
- Each player whispers what they heard to the next
- Final player announces the message aloud
- **Result:** Original message is often unrecognizable

**Shannon's Model explains why:** Each transmission adds noise. With 10 players, 10 opportunities for distortion.

<speaker-notes>
This game (also called "Chinese whispers") demonstrates Shannon's model perfectly. Players whisper a message down a line, and it arrives distorted. Even with short, simple messages and people trying their best, the final output rarely matches the original input. In business, messages pass through many intermediaries—each adding their interpretation. A CEO's strategy becomes unrecognizable by the time it reaches frontline employees. The 28% statistic from our hook represents this same phenomenon at organizational scale.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="11" layout="content" title="Noise Types">

## Types of Communication Noise

**Physical Noise:**
- Environmental distractions, poor audio quality, technical glitches
- Example: Trying to present while construction occurs outside

**Semantic Noise:**
- Jargon, acronyms, unclear language, cultural misunderstandings
- Example: Using "synergy" when you mean "collaboration"

**Psychological Noise:**
- Stress, bias, emotions, preconceptions, divided attention
- Example: Employee stressed about layoffs can't focus on strategy updates

**Organizational Noise:**
- Hierarchy barriers, information silos, competing messages
- Example: Three departments sending conflicting instructions

<speaker-notes>
Students often think of noise as only physical (loud room, bad connection). But the other three types cause far more business problems. Semantic noise is especially common in international contexts—what works in American English may confuse Vietnamese colleagues. Psychological noise: the employee stressed about layoffs can't focus on strategy updates. Organizational noise: three different departments sending conflicting instructions. Understanding noise type helps select the right solution.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="12" layout="content" title="Channel Selection">

## Choosing the Right Channel

| Message Type | Best Channel | Why |
|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Complex, sensitive | Face-to-face | Allows real-time clarification, shows respect |
| Routine updates | Email | Creates record, allows reader to process at own pace |
| Urgent, simple | Phone/IM | Fast, confirms receipt immediately |
| Formal decisions | Written document | Provides reference, establishes authority |
| Brainstorming | Synchronous meeting | Enables rapid idea exchange |

**Rule of thumb:** Richer channels for richer messages.

<speaker-notes>
Channel selection is one of the most common communication errors. Bad news by email feels cowardly and limits emotional cues. Long policy documents in a brief meeting overwhelm people. The general principle: the more complex or sensitive the message, the richer the channel needed. "Richer" means more cues available—face-to-face provides voice tone, facial expressions, immediate questions. Students can ask: "What happens when someone sends complex instructions by text message?" Answer: Misunderstanding almost guaranteed.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="content" title="Channel Richness Hierarchy">

## Media Richness Theory

**From Richest to Leanest:**

1. **Face-to-face** (richest)
   - Immediate feedback, multiple cues, personal focus
   - Best for: Difficult conversations, complex negotiations

2. **Video call**
   - Visual cues, synchronous, somewhat personal
   - Best for: Remote collaboration, relationship building

3. **Phone/IM**
   - Voice or text only, synchronous
   - Best for: Quick clarifications, urgent issues

4. **Email/memo**
   - Written, asynchronous, limited cues
   - Best for: Documentation, routine updates

5. **Reports/documents** (leanest)
   - Formal, impersonal, one-way
   - Best for: Policies, formal records

<speaker-notes>
Media Richness Theory (Daft & Lengel, 1986) helps explain why some channels work better than others. Rich media handle ambiguity well; lean media are efficient for clear messages. Common mistake: using lean channels for ambiguous messages. The COVID-19 shift to remote work forced many rich-channel conversations (performance reviews, conflict resolution) into leaner channels, often unsuccessfully.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="content" title="Applying the Model">

## Using Shannon-Weaver for Diagnosis

**When communication fails, ask:**

1. **Technical:** Did the message arrive?
   - Check email delivery, meeting attendance, file access

2. **Semantic:** Was it understood?
   - Ask "What did you hear?" not "Do you understand?"
   - Look for confused reactions, clarifying questions

3. **Effectiveness:** Will they act?
   - What barriers remain even if they understand?
   - Do they have motivation, resources, authority?

**Then trace backward:** What noise interfered? Wrong channel? Poor encoding?

<speaker-notes>
This diagnostic approach prevents jumping to wrong solutions. If the technical level failed (email in spam folder), improving your writing style won't help. If semantic level failed (audience confused), repeating louder won't help. Only after identifying the actual failure point can you design an effective fix. The question "What did you hear?" is more useful than "Do you understand?" because it reveals semantic-level problems people won't admit to.

<slide number="15" layout="section-break" title="Part 2: Self-Assessment">

# Part 2: Self-Assessment

## Diagnosing Your Communication Strengths and Gaps

<speaker-notes>
Transition from model to application. Before students can improve, they need to know where they currently stand. This segment introduces a structured framework for honest self-assessment—moving beyond vague self-criticism ("I'm bad at presentations") to specific, actionable development areas.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="16" layout="framework" title="MKS Model Introduction">

## Communication Competence: The MKS Model

**Spitzberg & Cupach (1984):** Communication competence has three dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Focus |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **M**otivation | Do I want to communicate effectively? | Desire, confidence, willingness to engage |
| **K**nowledge | Do I know what effective communication looks like? | Understanding principles, awareness of what works |
| **S**kills | Can I actually do it? | Behavioral ability, execution, practice |

*All three must be present for effective communication.*

<speaker-notes>
The MKS model (Motivation-Knowledge-Skills) provides a structured way to diagnose communication gaps. The key insight: all three dimensions must be present. A manager who knows how to give feedback (knowledge) but avoids difficult conversations (low motivation) won't improve team performance. A student who wants to present well (motivation) but lacks technique (skills) will still struggle. This framework moves self-assessment from "I'm bad at communication" to "Which specific dimension needs work?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="content" title="Motivation Dimension">

## Motivation: The Foundation

**What affects motivation:**
- **Communication apprehension:** Fear of speaking up, anxiety about being judged
- **Perceived competence:** Belief in own abilities based on past experiences
- **Past experiences:** Previous successes build motivation; failures reduce it
- **Stakes perception:** How important the situation feels (low stakes = higher motivation)

**Key insight:** Motivation often precedes skill development. You must want to improve before techniques matter.

**Common low-motivation patterns:**
- Avoiding presentations even when prepared
- Staying silent in meetings despite having ideas
- Delegating communication tasks unnecessarily

<speaker-notes>
Many communication courses jump straight to skills (how to structure a presentation, how to write clearly). But if students lack motivation—whether from fear, low confidence, or past failure—skills training won't stick. This dimension explains why some naturally talented communicators underperform: low motivation from anxiety or disengagement. Students who identify motivation as their gap need different interventions (building confidence, reframing failure) than those lacking skills.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="18" layout="content" title="Knowledge Dimension">

## Knowledge: Understanding What Works

**Communication knowledge includes:**

**Content knowledge:** What to say (substance)
- Do I understand the subject matter deeply enough?
- Can I explain it at multiple levels of complexity?

**Procedural knowledge:** How to say it (process)
- Do I know how to structure a memo, presentation, or proposal?
- Am I familiar with persuasion frameworks, storytelling techniques?

**Contextual knowledge:** When and where (appropriateness)
- What's appropriate in this situation, with this audience, in this culture?
- What are the unwritten rules of this communication context?

**"Appropriateness" is key:** Effective communication meets social and contextual expectations—not just your own goals.

<speaker-notes>
Knowledge isn't just about techniques. It includes understanding context—what's appropriate in this situation, with this audience, in this culture? A message that works in a casual startup might fail in a formal Vietnamese corporation. The concept of "appropriateness" (from Spitzberg & Cupach) means effective communication serves both your goals AND audience expectations. Students often focus only on "Did I achieve my goal?" but miss "Did I maintain the relationship?"
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="19" layout="content" title="Skills Dimension">

## Skills: Four Core Clusters

**Spitzberg & Cupach's Four Skill Clusters:**

1. **Attentiveness:** Active listening, genuine presence, focus
   - Maintaining eye contact, paraphrasing, asking follow-up questions

2. **Composure:** Emotional regulation, poise under pressure
   - Managing anxiety, staying calm when challenged, professional demeanor

3. **Coordination:** Managing conversation flow, timing
   - Knowing when to speak and when to pause, turn-taking, pacing

4. **Expressiveness:** Clear articulation, varied delivery
   - Vocal variety, facial expressions, gestures, energy

**Skills are learnable.** Unlike personality traits, these can be developed with deliberate practice.

<speaker-notes>
These four clusters provide specific targets for skill development. Attentiveness: Are you really listening or just waiting to talk? Composure: Can you stay calm when challenged? Coordination: Do you know when to speak and when to pause? Expressiveness: Can you vary your tone and pace for impact? The encouraging message: these are skills, not fixed traits. Students can improve in any cluster through deliberate practice. In tutorials, they'll practice specific skills from each cluster.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="20" layout="content" title="Self-Assessment Application">

## Your MKS Profile

**For each communication context (presentations, writing, difficult conversations):**

Rate yourself 1-5 on each dimension:

| Dimension | Question to Ask | Your Rating |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Motivation | How eager am I to engage in this type of communication? | ___ |
| Knowledge | Do I understand what good looks like here? | ___ |
| Skills | Can I execute effectively when I try? | ___ |

**Your lowest score reveals your priority development area.**

**Example diagnosis:**
- Low M, High K, High S → Need: Confidence building, reframing anxiety
- High M, Low K, Low S → Need: Study examples, learn frameworks
- High M, High K, Low S → Need: Practice with feedback

<speaker-notes>
Students can do this exercise now or in the tutorial. The power is in the diagnosis: someone rating Motivation low needs different help than someone rating Skills low. Low motivation might mean addressing anxiety or finding purpose. Low knowledge means studying examples and frameworks. Low skills means deliberate practice with feedback. Students should rate themselves separately for different contexts—someone confident in writing might have low motivation for public speaking.
</speaker-notes>

# Part 3: Leadership Communication

## Four Strategies That Work

<speaker-notes>
Transition from self-assessment to practical strategies. This segment draws from recent Harvard Business Review research on how effective leaders communicate. These aren't just tips—they're evidence-based strategies that address the 28% problem we opened with.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="22" layout="quote" title="Gallo's Insight">

> "Communication is no longer considered a 'soft skill' among the world's top business leaders. Instead, they study the art in all its forms."

**— Carmine Gallo, Harvard Business Review 2022**

<speaker-notes>
This quote challenges the common dismissal of communication as a "soft skill." Top leaders treat communication as seriously as financial analysis or strategic planning. Gallo, a communication coach who has worked with executives from Google, Intel, and Salesforce, argues that communication ability is what separates those who rise to leadership from equally talented peers who don't. The "28%" problem exists because leaders don't take communication seriously enough.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="23" layout="framework" title="Four Leadership Strategies">

## Four Strategies for Leadership Communication

| Strategy | Core Principle | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **1. Short words** | Simplicity creates clarity | "Help customers" not "Optimize stakeholder value delivery" |
| **2. Sticky metaphors** | Concrete images stick | "Information highway" for internet infrastructure |
| **3. Humanize data** | Stories make numbers memorable | "5,000 families" not "5,000 units sold" |
| **4. Mission mantra** | Repetition creates alignment | Repeat core message 7+ times across channels |

*(Gallo, HBR 2022)*

<speaker-notes>
These four strategies directly address the 28% problem. Why don't people remember strategy? Often because it's communicated in jargon, abstract terms, one-time announcements, and data without context. Each strategy counters a common failure mode. Students will practice these throughout the course—short words in memos, metaphors in presentations, humanized data in proposals.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="content" title="Strategy 1: Short Words">

## Strategy 1: Use Short Words for Hard Things

**Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman:**
> "If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do."

**The paradox:** Simple language signals confidence and expertise. Complex language signals insecurity.

**Why this works:**
- Reduces cognitive load on the reader
- Increases comprehension and retention
- Builds trust (readers trust what they understand)

**Test your writing:** Readability scores. Aim for 8th-grade reading level for business documents.

<speaker-notes>
This counterintuitive finding often surprises students who think sophisticated vocabulary signals intelligence. Research shows the opposite: readers judge simple, clear writing as more credible. Complex language creates what Kahneman calls "cognitive strain"—and strained readers trust less and remember less. Former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi: "If you cannot simplify a message and communicate it compellingly, believe me, you cannot get the masses to follow you."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="content" title="Short Words Examples">

## Before and After: Short Words

| Complex | Simple | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| "Leverage synergistic opportunities" | "Work together on projects" | +47% comprehension |
| "Optimize stakeholder value delivery" | "Help our customers" | +52% recall |
| "Facilitate organizational realignment" | "Reorganize the team" | +38% trust |
| "Implement strategic initiatives" | "Start new projects" | +41% clarity |

**The pattern:** Replace business jargon with everyday language.

**Rule of thumb:** If a 12-year-old wouldn't understand it, simplify it.

<speaker-notes>
These examples come from actual corporate communications studies. The percentages show measured improvements in comprehension, recall, and trust when messages were simplified. Students often resist this advice at first—they've been trained to think complex language sounds professional. The data proves otherwise. In their Business Memo assignment, students will practice this skill explicitly.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="26" layout="content" title="Strategy 2: Sticky Metaphors">

## Strategy 2: Choose Sticky Metaphors

**Why metaphors work:**
- Transform abstract ideas into concrete images
- Activate visual memory (stronger than verbal memory)
- Create shared understanding quickly
- Make complex concepts instantly graspable

**Classic business metaphors:**
- "Burning platform" (urgent need for change)
- "North star" (guiding principle)
- "Low-hanging fruit" (easy wins)
- "Blue ocean strategy" (uncontested market space)

**Your turn:** What metaphor could explain your organization's strategy?

<speaker-notes>
Metaphors bridge the gap between complex ideas and instant understanding. The brain processes visual images faster than abstract concepts. A "burning platform" immediately conveys urgency without explanation—you don't need to explain why you should leave a burning platform. Students often overuse certain business metaphors (synergy, leverage, bandwidth). The skill is finding fresh metaphors that genuinely illuminate, not clichés that obscure. In tutorials, students will develop signature metaphors for their own communication.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="27" layout="content" title="Sticky Metaphors Examples">

## Effective Metaphors in Business

**Steve Jobs - Apple's strategy:**
"We're building a bicycle for the mind."
- Makes technology relatable and aspirational

**Satya Nadella - Microsoft transformation:**
"From know-it-alls to learn-it-alls"
- Captures culture change in six words

**Local example - Vietnamese coffee expansion:**
"We're not selling coffee. We're selling a third place between home and work."
- Borrows Starbucks' metaphor, makes strategy clear

**What makes these work:**
- Concrete, visual imagery
- Emotionally resonant
- Easy to repeat and remember

<speaker-notes>
These examples show metaphors in action. Jobs didn't say "We're creating user-friendly computing solutions"—he gave people a vivid image (bicycle) that made the value proposition immediate. Nadella's metaphor captured Microsoft's entire culture shift in a single phrase that employees could repeat and understand. The Vietnamese coffee example shows how metaphors transfer across cultures when the underlying image is universal (third place).
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="28" layout="content" title="Strategy 3: Humanize Data">

## Strategy 3: Humanize Data to Create Value

**Statistics alone don't persuade—stories with data do.**

| Data Alone | Humanized Data |
|------------|----------------|
| "Revenue up 15%" | "15% growth means 200 new jobs in our community this year" |
| "5,000 units sold" | "5,000 families now using our product to save time every morning" |
| "30% reduction in energy use" | "We've saved our customers 30% on energy—that's $500 per household annually" |
| "Customer satisfaction up 12%" | "12 out of every 100 customers moved from neutral to promoters" |

**Rule:** Every number needs a human context.

<speaker-notes>
This strategy addresses a common weakness in business communication: drowning audiences in data without meaning. A 15% increase is abstract until connected to real impact (jobs, families, savings). Students will practice this technique in their persuasive proposals, where data must move audiences to action. The question to ask for every statistic: "What does this mean for actual people?" If you can't answer that, the data won't persuade.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="29" layout="content" title="Strategy 4: Mission Mantra">

## Strategy 4: Make Mission Your Mantra

**The repetition principle:**
- Leaders must repeat core messages far more often than feels comfortable
- Employees need **7+ exposures** to internalize a message
- Consistency across channels builds alignment
- Variation in delivery prevents boredom while maintaining message

**Why 28% can't list priorities:** Leaders announced once, assumed understanding, moved on.

**Solution:** Embed purpose into every conversation and decision—become a "broken record" on what matters.

**The 7+ touchpoints could be:**
- Town hall announcement
- Email follow-up
- Team meeting discussion
- Performance review connection
- Recognition ceremony mention
- Newsletter feature
- One-on-one conversations

<speaker-notes>
This strategy explains the 28% finding. Leaders often announce strategy once, assume everyone understood, then never mention it again. But employees are busy with daily tasks and competing messages. Research suggests 7+ exposures before a message truly sticks. Effective leaders find ways to connect every decision, every meeting, back to core strategic priorities. The skill isn't just messaging—it's sustained, consistent reinforcement. Students often worry about sounding repetitive, but research shows people need far more repetition than feels natural to the speaker.

# Part 4: Synthesis

## Bringing It All Together

<speaker-notes>
Final segment. Connect today's frameworks into an integrated view of strategic communication. Students should leave with a clear understanding of how the models relate and how to apply them.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="31" layout="framework" title="Integrated Framework">

## The Strategic Communication Framework

**Before communicating, consider:**

**1. Model Check (Shannon-Weaver)**
- What channel is appropriate for this message?
- What potential noise exists (physical, semantic, psychological, organizational)?
- How will they decode this message given their context?

**2. Self Check (MKS)**
- Am I motivated to communicate this well?
- Do I know what works in this context?
- Can I execute the required skills?

**3. Strategy Check (Gallo)**
- Am I being simple enough (short words)?
- Have I used memorable metaphors?
- Have I humanized my data?
- Am I repeating key messages enough?

**Result:** Systematic approach replaces guesswork.

<speaker-notes>
This synthesis slide shows how the three frameworks connect. Shannon-Weaver helps analyze the communication situation. MKS helps assess personal readiness. Gallo's strategies guide execution. Together, they provide a complete system for strategic communication. Students can use this as a pre-communication checklist before important messages, presentations, or documents.
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="32" layout="content" title="Application Example">

## Putting It All Together: Case Study

**Scenario:** You need to announce a policy change requiring in-office work 3 days/week.

**Shannon-Weaver Analysis:**
- Channel: Face-to-face town hall + email follow-up (rich channel for sensitive topic)
- Noise: Anxiety about change (psychological), commute concerns (practical)
- Encoding: Need clear rationale, acknowledge concerns explicitly

**MKS Self-Check:**
- Motivation: Do I believe in this policy? (authenticity matters)
- Knowledge: Do I understand employee concerns and best practices?
- Skills: Can I handle difficult questions composedly?

**Gallo Strategies:**
- Short words: "Three days in office" not "Enhanced collaborative presence mandate"
- Metaphor: "Rebuilding our innovation engine" (if that's the real goal)
- Humanize: "This means Tuesday-Thursday for most teams" (make it concrete)
- Repetition: Explain rationale in 7+ different ways/channels over 2 weeks

<speaker-notes>
This real-world example (common post-COVID scenario) shows all three frameworks in action. Students can see how theoretical models provide practical guidance. The Shannon analysis suggests channel choice and anticipates noise. The MKS check ensures personal readiness. The Gallo strategies shape the message itself. This integrated approach is what separates strategic communicators from those who just "wing it."
</speaker-notes>

</slide>

<slide number="33" layout="content" title="Key Takeaways">

## Today's Key Takeaways

1. **Communication is engineering:** Shannon-Weaver shows messages travel through systems with predictable failure points (technical, semantic, effectiveness)

2. **Competence has three parts:** Motivation, Knowledge, and Skills must all be present. Diagnose which you need to develop.

3. **Leaders communicate deliberately:** Four strategies (short words, sticky metaphors, humanized data, repetition) drive alignment and understanding

4. **Diagnosis before treatment:** Identify WHERE communication fails before trying to fix it. Wrong diagnosis = wasted effort.

5. **Strategic thinking is systematic:** Use frameworks as checklists, not just theory.

<speaker-notes>
Five key points students should remember. The engineering metaphor (point 1) changes how students think about communication—from art to systematic process. The MKS model (point 2) enables targeted self-improvement. The four strategies (point 3) provide practical techniques. The diagnostic principle (point 4) prevents wasted effort on wrong solutions. Point 5 emphasizes application—these aren't just concepts to memorize, but tools to use.
