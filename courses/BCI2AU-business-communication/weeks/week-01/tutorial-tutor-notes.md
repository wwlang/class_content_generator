## Why This Activity Matters (Key Message for Students)

**Opening statement:** "Today's self-assessment isn't just reflection — it's strategic preparation for every assessment in this course. The Written Communication Rubric evaluates you on Content & Strategy, Organization, Clarity, and Professional Tone. Knowing YOUR personal gap (Motivation, Knowledge, or Skills) allows you to focus improvement efforts where they'll have maximum impact on your grades and career readiness."

**Emphasize throughout session:**
- This connects to Learning Objective 6: Self-reflection for continuous improvement
- Students who know their gaps can request targeted feedback
- Development plan will be revisited in Week 10 for Executive Summary self-assessment section
- Foundation week activities BUILD competence before high-stakes assessments

## Valid Student Approaches (3-5 Expected Patterns)

Students may legitimately identify different gaps:

### 1. Motivation Gap (Most Common in Vietnamese Context)
- **Profile:** Strong technical skills, avoids public speaking due to anxiety
- **Evidence:** "I know how to present but I freeze when speaking in front of others"
- **Actions:** Join Toastmasters, volunteer for small in-class presentations, practice with friends weekly
- **Assessment connection:** Build confidence for Group Presentation (Week 12) through progressive exposure

### 2. Knowledge Gap (Common for 2nd Year Students)
- **Profile:** Confident speaker but lacks organizational frameworks
- **Evidence:** "I speak up in class but my written memos are disorganized and hard to follow"
- **Actions:** Study Pyramid Principle and SCQA frameworks, review memo examples, outline before drafting
- **Assessment connection:** Improve "Organization" rubric score on Business Memo (Week 4) and Persuasive Proposal (Week 7)

### 3. Skills Gap (Common for Students with Limited Practice)
- **Profile:** Motivated and knows theory but execution is weak
- **Evidence:** "I understand feedback techniques from reading but stumble when actually giving feedback in meetings"
- **Actions:** Role-play difficult conversations weekly, record and review practice presentations, get peer coaching
- **Assessment connection:** Develop "Professional Tone" and "Delivery" skills before presentations

### 4. Combined Gaps (Multiple Dimensions Need Work)
- **Profile:** Multiple dimensions need improvement simultaneously
- **Valid approach:** Prioritize ONE gap first based on next assessment deadline, create phased plan
- **Guide students:** "Which gap, if fixed, would have the biggest impact on your Business Memo in Week 4?"
- **Assessment connection:** Strategic prioritization based on portfolio sequence

### 5. Self-Overestimation (Requires Intervention)
- **Profile:** Rates all 5s but cannot provide specific evidence
- **Intervention:** Ask probing questions; if responses remain vague, challenge gently with examples
- **Guide students:** "Can you describe a specific time when your composure was tested? How did you handle it?"
- **Redirect:** "Everyone has gaps — the goal is finding yours so you can improve strategically"

## Facilitation Guidance

### Quick Review (5 min)
- Ask students to name one component of Shannon-Weaver (cold call or volunteer)
- Write "M-K-S" on board, ask what each letter stands for
- Clarify: "These aren't just models to memorize — they're diagnostic tools for YOUR communication"
- **Don't re-teach** — this is recall, not new instruction

### Main Activity Setup (5 min)
- Distribute templates (printed or display fillable PDF on screen)
- **Emphasize assessment connection:** "This Development Plan connects to EVERY assessment. Business Memo in Week 4 tests your written organization — knowing your gap NOW helps you prepare strategically."
- Frame honestly: "Be honest with yourself — this is formative work for YOUR growth, not graded on content"
- Set visible timer: "You have 35 minutes for self-assessment, then we'll discuss in pairs"

### Individual Self-Assessment (35 min)

**Structure:**
- **First 10 min:** Reflect on self-assessment questions (not yet filling template)
- **Next 25 min:** Transfer insights to template with specific evidence

**Circulation points:**
- Check for **vague answers** ("I'm not confident") → Push for specifics: "What specific situation makes you lose confidence?"
- Look for **all 5s or all 1s** → Challenge: "Everyone has strengths AND gaps. Where's your growing edge?"
- Encourage **concrete examples**, not generalizations: "Tell me about a time when..."
- **Connect to assessments:** "How will this gap affect your Business Memo if you don't address it?"

### Pair Discussion (15 min)

**Instructions:**
- Random pairs or strategic pairing (mix strong/developing if known)
- Each partner: 5 min to share their primary gap + evidence, 2.5 min for feedback
- Prompt: "Share your biggest gap and one specific example. Partner, listen and ask: Does the evidence support their rating? What do you notice about their self-awareness?"

**Facilitation:**
- Walk between pairs, listen for quality of feedback
- Intervene if pairs are too superficial: "Partner, ask them: How will fixing this gap improve your written work?"
- Cultural note: Vietnamese students may avoid critical feedback to preserve harmony — frame listener role as "helping a teammate succeed"

### Development Plan Writing (15 min)

**Instructions:**
- "Now finalize your action plan based on self-assessment AND peer feedback. Add the new section: Connection to Assessments."
- Actions must be: **Specific, Measurable, Within your control, Connected to course assessments**
- Bad example: "Be more confident" → Good: "Volunteer to answer one question per lecture to build speaking confidence for Group Presentation"
- Bad example: "Learn frameworks" → Good: "Study Pyramid Principle and outline 2 practice memos before Week 4 Memo submission"

**Circulation:**
- Check that actions are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Verify "Connection to Assessments" section references specific portfolio pieces
- Push for measurement: "How will you know if Action 1 worked?"

### Class Feedback (10 min)

**Selection:**
- 4-6 students (aim for variety: different gaps, different assessment focuses)
- Volunteer or random selection — all must be prepared

**Format:**
- Each student shares: Primary gap + One action + How it connects to an assessment
- Instructor role: Validate choices, connect to rubric criteria, offer additional suggestions
- Example validation: "Great — focusing on Knowledge of frameworks will directly improve your 'Organization' score on the Week 4 Memo rubric"

**Closing message:**
- "Your Development Plan is a living document. Save it. We'll revisit it in Week 10 when you write your Executive Summary self-assessment section. Track your progress — that's how you demonstrate Learning Objective 6: self-reflection for continuous improvement."

## Common Misconceptions to Address

| Misconception | Correction |
|---------------|------------|
| "I'm just not a natural communicator — some people have it, some don't" | **Correction:** Communication is a developable skill, not an innate trait. The MKS model proves all three dimensions (Motivation, Knowledge, Skills) can be improved with focused practice. |
| "Knowledge is the most important dimension" | **Correction:** All three dimensions are equally necessary. High Knowledge with low Motivation produces no behavior change. High Skills without Knowledge leads to confident but ineffective communication. |
| "I need to fix everything at once before Week 4" | **Correction:** Focus on ONE gap strategically. Fixing your primary gap creates cascading improvements in other dimensions. Prioritize based on next assessment deadline. |
| "Practicing presentations only improves Skills" | **Correction:** Practice builds all three: Motivation (confidence from success), Knowledge (discovering what works), and Skills (execution improvement). |
| "My score should be the same across all contexts" | **Correction:** Competence is contextual. You might be confident writing (high Motivation) but anxious presenting (low Motivation). Rate yourself for the contexts that matter most for this course. |
| "Self-assessment is just touchy-feely reflection" | **Correction:** Self-assessment is strategic planning. The Written Communication Rubric has specific criteria. Knowing YOUR gap helps you improve where rubric points are at stake. |

## Cultural Considerations for Vietnamese Students

### Face and Self-Assessment
- **Pattern:** Vietnamese students may underrate themselves to appear humble (cultural norm of modesty)
- **Frame:** "This is private development work — honesty helps YOU prepare for assessments, not about comparing yourself to others"
- **Option:** Consider anonymous submission or personal reflection if students are uncomfortable sharing publicly
- **Instructor message:** "There's no advantage to false modesty here — accurate self-assessment helps YOU improve strategically"

### Group Harmony in Pair Discussion
- **Pattern:** Partners may avoid critical feedback to preserve harmony (cultural value)
- **Frame listener role:** "You're helping your partner succeed by offering honest observations"
- **Provide sentence starters:** "I noticed... Have you considered... What if you tried..."
- **Normalize disagreement:** "It's okay to respectfully question each other's ratings — that's how we help each other grow"

### Fear of Speaking Up (Motivation Gap)
- **Pattern:** Many Vietnamese students identify low Motivation for public speaking due to hierarchical classroom norms
- **Normalize:** "In my experience teaching in Vietnam, many students share this gap — it's extremely common and completely fixable"
- **Strategy:** "Start building confidence in small groups (tutorials) before whole-class speaking. Progressive exposure works."
- **Connect to LO6:** "Self-awareness of this gap is already progress — now you can address it strategically before Week 12 presentation"

### Hierarchical Communication Knowledge
- **Pattern:** Students know Vietnamese business communication norms (indirect, hierarchical) but lack Western framework knowledge
- **Validate existing knowledge:** "Your understanding of Vietnamese communication is an ASSET, not a deficit"
- **Frame course:** "This course adds international frameworks to your existing knowledge base — you're becoming bicultural in communication"
- **Assessment connection:** "Business Memo scenarios allow Vietnamese context — apply frameworks to situations you already understand"

## If Things Go Wrong

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Students finish self-assessment too quickly (20 min instead of 35 min) | Add "evidence review" checkpoint: "Can you give 2 specific examples for each MKS rating?" |
| Students struggle to identify gaps | Use self-assessment questions as prompts; offer 1-on-1 guidance; share your own gap as model |
| Pair discussion too quiet | Provide specific discussion prompts on board; circulate and model good questions |
| Too many volunteers for class feedback sharing | "We'll continue next week" OR have students share in small groups of 4 |
| No volunteers for class feedback sharing | Cold call gently; share your own development gap as model; emphasize formative nature |
| Students resist self-assessment as "not relevant" | **Reframe:** "The Written Communication Rubric evaluates you on 4 criteria. This helps you improve where points are at stake. Not touchy-feely — strategic." |
| Student rates all 5s with no evidence | **Probe:** "Tell me about a time when your [dimension] was really tested. How did you handle it?" Challenge gently if still vague. |
| Student identifies wrong gap (e.g., clearly low Knowledge but rates it 5/5) | **Gentle correction:** "Your evidence suggests Knowledge might be a growing area — you mentioned not knowing how to structure a memo. Would you reconsider that rating?" |

## Connection to Assessments (Key Talking Points)

Emphasize these connections throughout the session:

| This Activity | Prepares For | Specific Connection |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| MKS Motivation self-assessment | Group Presentation (Week 12) | Low Motivation (presentation anxiety) must be addressed early through progressive practice |
| MKS Knowledge self-assessment | Business Memo (Week 4), Persuasive Proposal (Week 7) | Knowledge of frameworks (Pyramid Principle, SCQA, Cialdini) directly improves "Organization" and "Content & Strategy" rubric scores |
| MKS Skills self-assessment | All portfolio pieces and presentations | Skills (Expressiveness, Composure) determine "Clarity & Concision" and "Professional Tone" rubric scores |
| Development Plan action steps | Learning Objective 6 | Demonstrates ability to "evaluate personal communication effectiveness through self-reflection and integrate feedback for continuous improvement" |
| "Connection to Assessments" section in template | Week 10 Executive Summary | Students will revisit Development Plan and reflect on progress — provides evidence for self-assessment component |

**Final message to students:** "This Development Plan is your strategic roadmap. Every action you identify should improve a specific rubric criterion on a specific assessment. That's how self-awareness translates to better grades and career readiness."

## Assessment Alignment Validation

**Target Assessment:** All portfolio pieces (Business Memo, Persuasive Proposal, Executive Summary) and Group Presentation
**Skill Practiced:** Self-reflection and targeted development planning
**Rubric Criteria Addressed:** Indirectly supports ALL rubric criteria by enabling strategic improvement focus
**Learning Objective:** LO6 — Evaluate personal communication effectiveness through self-reflection and integrate feedback for continuous improvement

**Why this activity is valid for Week 1:**
- Foundation week activities build competence before high-stakes assessments
- Self-awareness is prerequisite for targeted improvement (can't improve if you don't know your gaps)
- Development Plan provides longitudinal tracking tool for entire semester
- Revisited in Week 10 for Executive Summary self-assessment section
- Connects to Written Communication Rubric criteria students will be evaluated on

This is NOT a generic reflection exercise — it's strategic preparation aligned with course assessments and rubrics.
