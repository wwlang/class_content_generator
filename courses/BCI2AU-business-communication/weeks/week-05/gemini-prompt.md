# Part 1: Managing Communication Anxiety

</slide>

<slide number="7" layout="framework" title="Communication Apprehension Theory">

## McCroskey's Communication Apprehension (CA) Theory

**Definition:** "An individual's level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons" (McCroskey, 1977)

**Two Types:**
- **Trait CA:** Enduring personality disposition toward communication anxiety across all contexts
- **State CA:** Situationally-triggered anxiety in specific communication contexts

**Impact:** High CA individuals withdraw from communication opportunities, affecting career advancement, perceived credibility, and leadership effectiveness

</slide>

<slide number="8" title="Four Contexts of Communication Apprehension">

## Four-Context Communication Model

McCroskey identified that CA manifests differently across four primary contexts:

1. **Public speaking** - Presenting to large groups
2. **Group discussions** - Contributing in team meetings
3. **Meetings** - Formal organizational settings
4. **Dyadic conversations** - One-on-one interactions

**Key insight:** You may have high CA in one context but low CA in another. A person comfortable in one-on-one conversations may experience severe anxiety in public speaking.

**Implication:** Treatment must be context-specific. Strategies that work for meetings may not work for presentations.

</slide>

<slide number="9" layout="framework" title="Managing CA - Treatment Approaches">

## Treatment Approaches for Communication Apprehension

**1. Systematic Desensitization**
- Repeated, graduated exposure to anxiety-producing situations
- Start small, build progressively to higher-stakes contexts
- Example: Practice 1-minute intro → 3-minute update → 10-minute presentation

**2. Cognitive Restructuring**
- Replace negative thoughts with positive self-talk
- Challenge catastrophic thinking ("Everyone will laugh at me" → "Most people are supportive")
- Focus on realistic outcome expectations

**3. Skills Training**
- Improve specific competencies to build confidence
- Learn frameworks for structure, practice delivery techniques
- Confidence grows from competence

</slide>

<slide number="10" title="Impact of Communication Apprehension">

## Consequences of High Communication Apprehension

**Career Effects:**
- Choice of college major (avoiding communication-intensive fields)
- Job selection (avoiding roles requiring high visibility)
- Career advancement (missing promotion opportunities)
- Job satisfaction (experiencing stress in communication-heavy roles)

**Perception Effects:**
- Reduced perceived credibility in professional contexts
- Lower interpersonal attraction ratings
- Diminished leadership effectiveness perceptions

**The Withdrawal Cycle:** "People who experience a high level of communication apprehension will withdraw from and seek to avoid communication whenever possible" (McCroskey, 1977)

</slide>

<slide number="11" title="Anxiety Management Plan">

## Abrahams' Anxiety Management Plan (AMP)

**Before Communication:**
- Physical preparation: Deep breathing, movement to release tension
- Mental reframing: "I'm excited" vs "I'm nervous" (anxiety and excitement share physiological markers)
- Preparation: Know your opening 30 seconds cold

**During Communication:**
- Grounding techniques: Feel your feet on the floor, grip the podium
- Focus strategies: Speak to friendly faces first, make eye contact
- Slow down: Nervous speakers rush—intentionally pause

**After Communication:**
- Reflection without rumination: What went well? One improvement for next time
- No catastrophizing: Avoid replaying perceived mistakes endlessly

</slide>

<slide number="12" title="Physiological Anxiety Management">

## Physical Techniques for Managing Anxiety

**Breathing Exercises:**
- Box breathing: Inhale 4 counts, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4
- Diaphragmatic breathing: Breathe into your belly, not chest
- Do this 2-3 minutes before speaking

**Movement and Grounding:**
- Light exercise before presenting (walk, stretch)
- Ground feet firmly, feel connection to floor
- Use "power poses" before high-stakes communication

**Voice Warm-ups:**
- Hum, tongue twisters, vocal exercises
- Warm up your instrument before using it

**The Reframe:** Anxiety symptoms (racing heart, sweating) are your body preparing for performance, not signaling danger

</slide>

<slide number="13" layout="section-break" title="Section 2">

# Part 2: Presentation Structure Foundations

</slide>

<slide number="14" layout="framework" title="Duarte's Sparkline">

## The Sparkline™ Diagram

**Core Concept:** Create tension by oscillating between "what is" (current reality) and "what could be" (future vision)

**Components:**
- **"What Is"** - Current reality, status quo, problems, limitations
- **"What Could Be"** - Future vision, solutions, possibilities, transformation

**How It Works:** The gap between current reality and future possibility creates tension that maintains audience engagement throughout your presentation

**Application:** Strategic presentations, change management communications, sales pitches, investment proposals

</slide>

<slide number="15" title="Sparkline in Action">

## How the Sparkline Pattern Works

**Traditional Linear Presentation:**
- Problem statement
- Analysis
- Solution
- Implementation plan
- Questions

**Sparkline Pattern:**
- What Is: Current state (problem exists)
- What Could Be: Imagine if we solved this (vision)
- What Is: But we face these obstacles (reality check)
- What Could Be: Here's how we overcome them (solution)
- What Is: Implementation will require effort (honest acknowledgment)
- What Could Be: The transformed future state (new bliss)

The oscillation creates emotional momentum toward action.

</slide>

<slide number="16" title="Sparkline Example: Steve Jobs iPhone Launch">

## Case Study: Steve Jobs' iPhone Launch (2007)

**Challenge:** Introduce revolutionary product to skeptical audience

**Sparkline Structure:**
- **What Is:** Current phones are difficult to use, limited functionality, poor internet experience
- **What Could Be:** iPhone with touchscreen, full internet, iPod integration
- **What Is:** But existing smartphones are clunky, require stylus, get lost
- **What Could Be:** iPhone is intuitive—one button, finger control, fits in pocket
- **Repeat...** Building toward transformed future

**Result:** One of the most successful product launches in history

**Lesson:** Structure creates emotional engagement; audience must feel the gap before embracing the solution

</slide>

<slide number="17" layout="framework" title="Audience as Hero">

## Duarte's "Audience as Hero" Framework

**Traditional Mindset:** The presenter is the hero of the story
- "Look what I accomplished"
- "Here's my brilliant idea"
- Focus: What I want to say

**Reframe:** The audience is the hero; the presenter is the mentor
- "Here's what you can accomplish"
- "This idea empowers you"
- Focus: What the audience needs to hear

**How This Changes Your Presentation:**
- Content shifts from "my achievements" to "how this helps you"
- Call to action becomes audience-centered ("you should act") not presenter-centered ("I recommend")
- Success metrics focus on audience transformation, not presenter credibility

</slide>

<slide number="18" title="Three-Act Presentation Structure">

## Three-Act Structure

**Act 1: Beginning (15% of presentation)**
- Establish "what is"—the current reality
- Introduce the gap between reality and possibility
- Hook the audience with a compelling question or statistic

**Act 2: Middle (70% of presentation)**
- Alternate between "what is" and "what could be"
- Progressively increase stakes with each oscillation
- Build evidence, address objections, deepen engagement

**Act 3: End (15% of presentation)**
- Paint the "new bliss"—the transformed future state
- Clear call to action
- Memorable closing (S.T.A.R. moment)

</slide>

<slide number="19" title="Opening Your Presentation">

## Act 1: The Opening (15%)

**Goal:** Establish the gap between "what is" and "what could be"

**Essential Components:**
1. **Hook:** Compelling statistic, question, or story (30 seconds)
2. **Context:** Why this topic matters now (1 minute)
3. **The Gap:** The tension between current reality and possibility (30 seconds)
4. **Roadmap:** What we'll cover and why (30 seconds)

**What NOT to do:**
- Start with "My name is..." (they know)
- Apologize ("I'm not an expert, but...")
- Begin with agenda slides (boring)
- Launch into background/history (save for body)

</slide>

<slide number="20" title="Building the Body">

## Act 2: The Middle (70%)

**Goal:** Oscillate between "what is" and "what could be" with increasing stakes

**Structure Strategies:**
- **Problem → Solution Pattern:** Show obstacle, show how to overcome it, repeat
- **Journey Pattern:** Move chronologically through stages of transformation
- **Comparison Pattern:** Contrast current state with future state across dimensions

**Engagement Techniques:**
- Address objections before audience raises them ("You might be thinking...")
- Use case studies to show "what could be" in action
- Return to the opening hook/question periodically for coherence
- Build stakes progressively (each oscillation should raise the importance)

</slide>

<slide number="21" title="Closing Your Presentation">

## Act 3: The Ending (15%)

**Goal:** Paint the "new bliss" and inspire action

**Essential Components:**
1. **Synthesis:** Bring together the journey (30 seconds)
2. **New Bliss:** Paint the transformed future state vividly (1 minute)
3. **Call to Action:** What should the audience do now? (30 seconds)
4. **S.T.A.R. Moment:** Something They'll Always Remember (30 seconds)

**Characteristics of Strong Closings:**
- Aspirational (audience feels inspired)
- Concrete (specific vision of success)
- Actionable (clear next steps)
- Memorable (they'll recall your message days later)

**What to Avoid:**
- Trailing off with "So... yeah..."
- Introducing new information
- Ending with "Any questions?" (weakens impact)
- Thanking the audience excessively

</slide>

<slide number="22" title="S.T.A.R. Moments">

## S.T.A.R. Moments
**Something They'll Always Remember**

Create lasting impact through:
- **Memorable dramatizations** - Props, demos, physical demonstrations
- **Repeatable sound bites** - Quotable phrases that stick
- **Evocative visuals** - Images that create emotional response
- **Emotive storytelling** - Personal or case study narratives
- **Shocking statistics** - Data that challenges assumptions

**Example:** Bill Gates released mosquitoes during a TED talk about malaria. No one forgot his point: "There's no reason only poor people should have the experience of being bitten by disease-carrying insects."

</slide>

<slide number="23" title="Duarte's Visual Principles">

## Additional Duarte Principles for Presentations

**The 3-Second Rule:**
Audiences should comprehend each slide in approximately 3 seconds (glance media principle)

**Repetition Principle:**
Key messages should be repeated three times for retention

**The Contrast Principle:**
Create visual and content contrast to maintain engagement
- Vary slide layouts (data → story → visual → data)
- Alternate between analytical and emotional content
- Use silence strategically (pause for impact)

**Slide as Billboard:**
"When people drive, they only briefly take their eyes off their main focus. Slides should work the same way—support the speaker without requiring deep reading."

</slide>

<slide number="24" layout="section-break" title="Section 3">

# Part 3: Spontaneous Speaking

</slide>

<slide number="25" layout="framework" title="What? So What? Now What?">

## Abrahams' "What? So What? Now What?" Framework

**Purpose:** Three-part structure for spontaneous speaking in any context

**Components:**
1. **What?** — State the core information or issue concisely
2. **So What?** — Explain why it matters to the audience
3. **Now What?** — Provide actionable next steps or implications

**Application:** Q&A sessions, hallway conversations, elevator pitches, meeting contributions, project updates

**Why It Works:** Provides instant mental scaffolding when you have no time to prepare. Your brain has a template to organize thoughts on the fly.

</slide>

<slide number="26" title="What? So What? Now What? Example">

## Framework Application Example

**Scenario:** Your manager asks in a hallway conversation: "How's the team handling the new project management software?"

**Without Framework:**
"Um, I think it's going okay... some people like it, some don't... we're still figuring it out... there have been a few issues but nothing major... we're working through it..."

**With "What? So What? Now What?":**
- **What:** "We're two weeks into rollout with 60% of the team actively using it."
- **So What:** "Early adopters report 3 hours saved per week on status updates, which aligns with our efficiency goals."
- **Now What:** "I'll have a full adoption report by end of month with recommendations for supporting the remaining 40%."

</slide>

<slide number="27" title="Additional Spontaneous Speaking Structures">

## Alternative Frameworks for Impromptu Speaking

**P.R.E.P. (Point, Reason, Example, Point):**
- State your main point
- Give a reason supporting it
- Provide an example
- Restate your point

**A.D.D. (Answer, Detail, Describe):**
- Answer the question directly
- Add relevant detail
- Describe implications or next steps

**T.R.A.C. (Topic, Relevance, Application, Conclusion):**
- Name the topic/issue
- Explain relevance to audience
- Show application/example
- Conclude with key insight

**When to use each:** All three work for different speaking contexts. Experiment to find which feels most natural for you.

</slide>

<slide number="28" title="Preparing for Spontaneity">

## The Athletic Preparation Model

**Key Insight:** You can prepare for spontaneous communication through structured practice

**How Athletes Train:** Soccer players practice dribbling around cones to build reflexes for unpredictable game situations. They don't know exactly what will happen, but repetitive practice builds automatic responses.

**How Communicators Train:**
- Practice responding to random prompts from a question deck
- Record 30-second impromptu responses on various topics
- Join group discussions where you must contribute without advance notice
- Volunteer to answer questions in meetings (even when not called on)

**Result:** Like athletes, you build "communication reflexes" that activate under pressure

</slide>

<slide number="29" title="Managing Silence and Pauses">

## Using Silence Strategically in Spontaneous Speaking

**The Problem:** Most people fear silence and fill it with "um," "uh," and verbal fillers

**The Reframe:** Silence is powerful, not awkward

**Strategic Uses of Pauses:**
1. **Thinking pause:** "That's a great question. [2-second pause while you think] Here's what I'd say..."
2. **Emphasis pause:** "This decision will affect everyone [pause] for the next five years."
3. **Transition pause:** [Finish point] [Pause] [Begin next point]
4. **Reflection pause:** "Let me think about that for a moment..." [pause]

**Practice:** Record yourself answering impromptu questions. Count your filler words. Practice replacing them with 1-2 second pauses. The pause feels long to you but sounds confident to listeners.

</slide>

<slide number="30" layout="section-break" title="Section 4">

# Part 4: Authenticity in Oral Communication

</slide>

<slide number="31" layout="framework" title="Channel-Authenticity Matrix">

## Brodsky's Channel-Authenticity Matrix

**Core Insight:** Different channels afford different levels of emotional expression and authenticity perception. Strategic channel selection optimizes outcomes.

| Channel | Best When... | Authenticity Dynamics |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **In-person** | Your communication IS authentic; you want genuine emotional expression | Full nonverbal cues; authenticity easily perceived |
| **Video call** | You need presence but with slight emotional buffering | Visual connection with reduced intensity |
| **Phone/Audio** | You need to modulate emotional expression | Partial masking while maintaining vocal connection |
| **Email/Text** | You must communicate carefully OR channels unavailable | Maximum control over message; reduced spontaneity |

</slide>

<slide number="32" title="Channel Selection Examples">

## Applying the Channel-Authenticity Matrix

**Scenario 1: Delivering Difficult Feedback**
- **Poor choice:** Email (feels cowardly, lacks human connection)
- **Better choice:** Phone (genuine concern in voice, recipient has processing space)
- **Best choice:** In-person if possible (shows respect, allows dialogue)

**Scenario 2: Sharing Exciting News**
- **Poor choice:** Text (diminishes excitement, feels impersonal)
- **Better choice:** Phone (vocal enthusiasm clear)
- **Best choice:** Video or in-person (full emotional expression)

**Scenario 3: Presenting Complex Analysis**
- **Poor choice:** Phone (no visual support for data)
- **Better choice:** Email with detailed write-up (time to process)
- **Best choice:** Video meeting with slides (combines visual data with human explanation)

</slide>

<slide number="33" title="Impression Management Paradox">

## The Impression Management Paradox

**Common Belief:** Being authentic means expressing your true self identically in all situations

**Research Reality:** Strategic impression management can make you seem MORE authentic in certain contexts

**Why?** Social situations have norms. Meeting those norms while maintaining genuine intent creates perceived authenticity. Violating norms—even "authentically"—can be perceived as inauthentic or inappropriate.

**Example:** A leader who adjusts communication style for different audiences (board vs. frontline employees) may be perceived as more authentic than one who maintains identical style regardless of context.

**Implication:** Authenticity ≠ Unchanging. Authenticity = Genuine intent adapted to context.

</slide>

<slide number="34" title="Authenticity Across Cultures">

## Authenticity in Cross-Cultural Communication

**Western Authenticity Emphasis:**
- Individual expression
- "Being yourself" regardless of context
- Direct communication valued
- Consistency across situations

**East Asian Authenticity Emphasis:**
- Relational harmony
- Adapting to social roles appropriately
- Indirect communication preserves relationships
- Context-appropriate behavior

**The Bridge:** Both cultures value genuine intent. The difference is in how authenticity is demonstrated.

**For Vietnamese Professionals in Global Business:**
You can maintain Vietnamese cultural values (respect, harmony, hierarchy) while adapting communication patterns for international contexts. This is not being inauthentic—it's being strategically authentic.

</slide>

<slide number="35" title="Finding Your Authentic Voice">

## Developing Your Authentic Communication Style

**Self-Awareness First:**
- What communication contexts feel most natural to you?
- Where do you experience the most CA?
- What values do you want your communication to reflect?

**Practice Authenticity:**
- Start with low-stakes situations to experiment with voice
- Record yourself and assess: "Does this sound like me?"
- Get feedback from trusted peers: "Did that feel genuine?"

**Balance Adaptation and Consistency:**
- **Adapt:** Match formality level, communication norms, audience expectations
- **Maintain:** Your core values, genuine intent, personal warmth

**Remember:** Executive presence doesn't mean becoming someone else—it means becoming the most effective version of yourself.

<slide number="36" layout="section-break" title="Key Takeaways">

# Key Takeaways

</slide>

<slide number="37" title="Summary">

## Week 5 Key Takeaways

1. **Communication Apprehension is manageable:** Use systematic desensitization, cognitive restructuring, and skills training. Build an Anxiety Management Plan for before/during/after communication.

2. **Structure creates confidence:** Duarte's Sparkline (oscillating "what is" and "what could be") maintains engagement. Three-act structure provides clear beginning, middle, and end. S.T.A.R. moments create lasting impact.

3. **Prepare for spontaneity:** The "What? So What? Now What?" framework organizes thoughts instantly. Practice impromptu speaking to build communication reflexes like athletes build physical reflexes.

4. **Strategic authenticity wins:** Choose communication channels based on emotional requirements. Adapt to context while maintaining genuine intent. Authenticity ≠ unchanging; authenticity = genuine intent adapted appropriately.

</slide>

<slide number="38" title="Integration Exercise">

## Applying Today's Frameworks Together

**Scenario:** You're presenting a project proposal to leadership next week.

**Apply all four frameworks:**

1. **CA Management:** What's your Anxiety Management Plan?
   - Before: Deep breathing, know opening 30 seconds cold
   - During: Ground feet, speak to friendly faces first
   - After: Reflect on one success, one improvement

2. **Structure:** How will you use the Sparkline?
   - What Is: Current process costs $500K annually
   - What Could Be: New system saves $200K
   - Oscillate through challenges and solutions
   - End with "new bliss" vision

</slide>

<slide number="39" title="Integration Exercise Continued">

## Scenario Continued

3. **Spontaneous Speaking:** How will you handle Q&A?
   - Use What? So What? Now What? for unexpected questions
   - Example: "What if the vendor goes out of business?"
     - What: We've built contract protections and data export capabilities
     - So What: This ensures business continuity regardless of vendor stability
     - Now What: I can share our risk mitigation plan after this meeting

4. **Authenticity:** Which channel and how to maintain genuine presence?
   - Channel: In-person (high stakes require full nonverbal connection)
   - Authenticity: Adapt formality to executive audience while maintaining genuine enthusiasm for the project
   - Balance: Professional structure + personal belief in the solution
