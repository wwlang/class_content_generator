## Valid Student Approaches

Students will approach the mini-pitch task differently. Here are 5 valid approaches you should recognize and support:

### Approach 1: Problem-Focused Emphasis
**Characteristics:**
- Spends 60+ seconds establishing the problem with vivid details, evidence, stakes
- Solution is introduced more briefly (30-40 seconds)
- Strong emotional appeal in problem description

**Strengths:** Builds urgency and audience buy-in; demonstrates persuasive awareness that problem must be felt
**Limitations:** May run out of time before fully explaining solution
**Feedback:** "Your problem description created strong urgency—I felt the need for change. For balance, ensure your solution gets equal time. In your written proposal, you'll have space for both; here, practice efficient problem framing in 30 seconds so solution can shine."

### Approach 2: Solution-Focused Emphasis
**Characteristics:**
- Briefly states the problem (15-20 seconds)
- Majority of time describes the solution in detail—how it works, benefits, implementation
- May include specific tactics or timeline

**Strengths:** Action-oriented, shows confidence in the solution
**Limitations:** Audience may not feel urgency if problem isn't established strongly
**Feedback:** "Your solution was detailed and compelling. To strengthen impact, spend a bit more time establishing why the problem is urgent—make us feel the pain before you offer the cure. This will make your solution even more appealing."

### Approach 3: Data-Driven Pitch
**Characteristics:**
- Opens with statistics or evidence about the problem
- Solution justified with ROI, metrics, industry benchmarks
- Logical, analytical tone throughout

**Strengths:** Credible and persuasive for analytical decision-makers
**Limitations:** May lack emotional connection or personal authenticity
**Feedback:** "Your data built strong credibility—I trusted your analysis. Consider adding one sentence about why YOU care about this problem. Combining data with personal motivation creates both logos (logic) and ethos (credibility) from Cialdini's frameworks."

### Approach 4: Storytelling Pitch
**Characteristics:**
- Opens with a narrative example or anecdote illustrating the problem
- Solution presented as the resolution to the story
- Conversational, engaging tone

**Strengths:** Emotionally engaging, memorable, demonstrates authenticity
**Limitations:** May lack specificity or concrete details about solution
**Feedback:** "Your story immediately engaged us—I could visualize the problem. Now add one specific detail about your solution: What exactly are you proposing? A number, a timeline, a specific action? This grounds the story in actionable reality."

### Approach 5: Direct/Executive Style
**Characteristics:**
- Very concise problem statement (1-2 sentences)
- Clear solution (1-2 sentences)
- Extended call to action with specific ask and next steps
- Minimal elaboration, assumes audience will ask questions if needed

**Strengths:** Respects audience time, executive communication style
**Limitations:** May finish well under 2 minutes, missing opportunity to persuade
**Feedback:** "Your conciseness reflects executive communication style—appreciated in time-constrained settings. Since you have the full 2 minutes, consider expanding with one concrete example or piece of evidence. This adds persuasive weight without losing clarity."

## Common Misconceptions to Address

### Misconception 1: "I need to have a fully developed proposal before presenting"
**Reality:** Today's practice is about presenting CORE CONCEPTS (problem + solution), not a complete proposal. You're testing whether your idea is compelling when spoken aloud.

**How to Address:**
- During prep time: "You're not pitching a finished proposal—you're practicing presenting the core idea. Problem + Solution + Ask. That's it. The details come later in your written Week 7 submission."
- In feedback: "Even though your solution wasn't fully detailed, your core idea came through clearly. That's the goal today—test if the concept is compelling. Develop details in writing."

### Misconception 2: "If I look nervous, I've failed"
**Reality:** Managing anxiety so it doesn't prevent communication is success. Visible nervousness (slight trembling, faster pace) is normal and doesn't undermine your message if you continue with confidence.

**How to Address:**
- Before presentations: "McCroskey's research shows 10-20% of people have significant communication apprehension. If you feel nervous, that's your body preparing you to perform. The skill is continuing despite nervousness."
- In feedback: "Even though you mentioned feeling nervous, you maintained eye contact and completed your pitch—that's anxiety MANAGEMENT, which is the real skill. Well done."

### Misconception 3: "Oral presentation and written proposal are separate skills"
**Reality:** Presenting your proposal idea orally BEFORE writing helps clarify your thinking. You'll discover gaps in logic, unclear phrasing, or weak arguments when you have to explain them aloud.

**How to Address:**
- During setup: "This isn't separate from your written proposal—it's preparation for it. When you present orally, you'll notice what's clear and what's confusing. Use that insight when you write in Week 7."
- In feedback: "Did you notice when you explained [X], it clicked immediately? That clarity should carry into your written version. Conversely, if [Y] felt unclear when spoken, rethink that section."

### Misconception 4: "I must convince everyone my idea is perfect"
**Reality:** The goal is to present confidently, not to defend against all criticism. Peer feedback helps you refine, not prove you're right.

**How to Address:**
- Before presentations: "Your classmates aren't judging your idea as good or bad—they're observing your DELIVERY. Did you speak clearly? Manage anxiety? Structure your pitch? The idea itself can evolve."
- In feedback session: "Let's focus feedback on delivery techniques—voice, pacing, eye contact—not debating whether the proposal idea is viable. That evaluation happens in the written submission with full details."

### Misconception 5: "2 minutes is too short to say anything meaningful"
**Reality:** 2 minutes is ~300 words—enough for a clear problem, solution, and ask. Constraint forces clarity and prioritization.

**How to Address:**
- During prep: "Two minutes feels short, but it's perfect for testing your core message. If you can't explain the essence in 2 minutes, your written proposal may also lack focus. Use this constraint to sharpen your thinking."
- In feedback: "Notice how much [Student X] communicated in just 2 minutes? Constraint breeds clarity. Your written proposal will have space to elaborate, but the core should be this tight."

## Facilitation Guidance

### During Quick Review (5 min)
**Goal:** Activate lecture knowledge and set Delivery & Presence criteria from Group Presentation Rubric

**Approach:**
- Ask students to recall the three acts of Duarte's structure (call on 1-2 students)
- Emphasize: "Today we're practicing TWO things: (1) presenting proposal content orally, and (2) managing anxiety with confident delivery. The idea doesn't need to be perfect—focus on HOW you present it."
- Reference Rubric: "Week 12's Group Presentation grades 25% on Delivery & Presence—voice, pace, eye contact, confidence. Today builds that skill in a low-stakes environment."
- Normalize anxiety: "Nervousness is expected. Use the techniques from lecture: breathing, power pose in your seat, visualization before you stand."

**If students seem anxious:**
- Lead a quick 4-7-8 breathing exercise: "Let's all try this together. Inhale for 4... hold for 7... exhale for 8... One more time..."
- Normalize: "This is practice, not performance. Your classmates are here to support, not judge. By Week 12, you'll have done this so many times that anxiety will be much lower."

### During Preparation Time (7 min)
**Goal:** Support efficient outlining focused on problem + solution + ask

**Approach:**
- Circulate and check note cards—ensure students outline STRUCTURE, not write full scripts
- For struggling students: "Start with one sentence: 'The problem is...' Then one sentence: 'My solution is...' Then: 'I'm asking you to...' Build from there."
- For students overthinking: "You have 7 minutes to outline, not perfect. Jot down: Problem (what + why it matters). Solution (what + how it helps). Ask (specific action). You'll refine in the moment."
- For advanced students: "You've got solid content—now think about DELIVERY. Where will you make eye contact? Where will you pause for emphasis? How will you manage nervousness in the first 10 seconds?"

**Time warnings:**
- "5 minutes left"
- "3 minutes left"
- "1 minute—wrap up your outline"
- "30 seconds—final thoughts"

### During Presentations (56 min total)
**Goal:** Create supportive environment while maintaining strict 2-minute timing

**Approach:**
- **Random order or alphabetical** to reduce anticipatory anxiety (students don't sit waiting to be "next")
- Introduce each: "Next: [Name] presenting a proposal pitch. Let's give full attention."
- **Strict timing:**
  - Show fingers to signal time remaining (1 min, 30 sec)
  - At 2:00, gently interrupt: "Time—thank you [Name]." (Don't let them continue; time management is part of the skill)
- **Non-verbal encouragement:** Nod, smile, maintain eye contact as tutor-audience member—model engaged listening
- **After each pitch:** Brief pause (3 seconds) before thanking them and calling next presenter—gives audience moment to absorb

**If a student freezes or experiences high anxiety:**
- Allow 5 seconds of silence (feels long to you, but gives them recovery time)
- If still frozen: "Take a breath. Glance at your notes. We're all here to support you. Start when ready."
- If they can't continue: "You can pause and restart from the beginning, or we can return to you at the end after you've seen more examples. What would help?"
- If extreme distress (panic attack symptoms): "Let's step outside for a moment" (private conversation, offer accommodations)

**If a student goes significantly over 2 minutes:**
- At 2:15, gently interrupt: "I need to stop you there—2 minutes is up. Strong content. For your written proposal, you'll have space to elaborate. Let's talk after about prioritizing for time constraints."

**If a student finishes in under 90 seconds:**
- Note it, but don't interrupt. In feedback later: "You finished at about 80 seconds. You have the full 2 minutes—consider expanding one point with an example or evidence. Practicing full time usage prepares you for longer Week 12 presentations."

### During Mid-Session Break (2 min)
**Goal:** Reset energy and anxiety levels before second round

**Approach:**
- Quick stretch: "Everyone stand, roll shoulders, shake out hands"
- Anxiety reset: "If you're presenting in Round 2, take a moment for one 4-7-8 breath cycle. Visualize yourself succeeding."
- Encouragement: "Round 1 presenters—well done. You've just built confidence for Week 12. Round 2—you've seen examples now, use what worked."

### During Group Feedback Session (12 min)
**Goal:** Model specific, constructive feedback focused on Delivery & Presence

**Approach:**
- Select 6 presenters (mix of strong delivery and developing—avoid only showcasing "best")
- Invite peers to provide feedback using structure: "Focus on DELIVERY—voice, pacing, eye contact, confidence. Not the proposal idea itself."
- **Model first:** "I'll give feedback to [Student A] first. I noticed your eye contact engaged multiple people in different parts of the room—that created connection and showed confidence. Your pacing was conversational, which made complex ideas accessible. One technique to practice: strategic pausing. After your problem statement, pause for 2-3 seconds. That silence lets us absorb the severity before you introduce the solution, increasing impact."

**Feedback structure for peers:**
- "I noticed [specific delivery observation]..."
- "This worked because [impact on audience]..."
- "One technique to practice: [specific, actionable suggestion]..."

**Avoid:**
- Vague praise ("Good job," "Nice work") without specifics
- Critiquing the proposal IDEA ("I don't think that solution would work because...")—focus is on delivery, not idea viability
- Overly critical feedback that discourages ("You were too nervous," "You didn't make any eye contact")—frame as "techniques to practice"
- Letting feedback session run long (stick to 2 min per presenter max)

**If feedback becomes vague or unhelpful:**
- Redirect: "Let's make feedback more specific. Instead of 'good delivery,' describe WHAT you observed. For example: 'Your voice projected clearly to the back row' or 'Your opening question hooked my attention immediately.'"

### Cultural Considerations (Vietnamese Context)

**Communication Apprehension in Vietnamese Culture:**
- **Context:** Public speaking and self-promotion can feel uncomfortable due to cultural emphasis on humility and collective harmony
- **Manifestation:** Students may avoid eye contact with authority figures (you, the tutor), speak very softly, minimize their achievements or ideas ("This is just a small idea...")
- **Facilitation Approach:**
  - Normalize different comfort levels: "In Vietnamese culture, speaking up can feel like showing off. But in business communication, presenting your ideas is your responsibility to your audience and organization—it's service, not arrogance."
  - Reframe confidence: "Confident delivery doesn't mean you're claiming to be perfect. It means you respect your audience enough to speak clearly and make your message easy to understand."
  - Adapt eye contact expectations: "If direct eye contact feels uncomfortable, focus on friendly faces or foreheads. The goal is connection, not staring. Cultural adaptation is professional."

**Peer Feedback Dynamics:**
- **Context:** Vietnamese students may hesitate to critique peers (fear of causing loss of face or damaging relationships)
- **Manifestation:** Feedback is overly positive ("Everything was perfect") or too general ("Good job")
- **Facilitation Approach:**
  - Frame as support: "Specific feedback is a gift—it helps your classmate improve. Withholding it denies them growth. You're coaching, not criticizing."
  - Use "I noticed" language: "Instead of 'You should slow down,' try 'I noticed your pace was quick—slowing slightly might help us absorb each point.' This describes observation without sounding prescriptive."
  - Model vulnerability: "When I first started presenting, I spoke way too fast because I was nervous. I didn't realize until someone gave me specific feedback. That helped me improve—specific feedback is how we all grow."

**Proposal Idea Sharing:**
- **Context:** Students may feel shy sharing ideas that feel "not good enough" or fear judgment
- **Manifestation:** Apologizing during pitch ("Sorry, this is probably a bad idea..."), minimizing their proposal ("This is just a small thing...")
- **Facilitation Approach:**
  - Set norms: "No apologies or disclaimers. Present your idea confidently—even if you're not 100% sure, act as if you are. Practice confidence NOW so it's natural in high-stakes situations later."
  - Reframe: "Every major innovation started as an idea someone pitched. Your idea doesn't have to be world-changing—it has to be clearly communicated. That's what we're practicing."

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: "Can I present a proposal idea I'm planning to use for the Week 7 assessment?"**
A: "Absolutely—that's ideal. Presenting it orally first helps you test if the core idea is compelling and identify gaps in your logic before writing. Many students find oral practice makes their written proposal much stronger."

**Q: "What if I don't have a proposal idea yet?"**
A: "Choose one of the simplified options provided—Sustainability, Technology Upgrade, Training Investment. You're practicing DELIVERY, not developing a full proposal today. The scenario is just a vehicle for practicing confident presentation."

**Q: "Can I use my phone or notes while presenting?"**
A: "You can glance at your note card for structure, but don't read from it or your phone. The goal is conversational delivery—like explaining your idea to a colleague over coffee, but with professional tone. Practice now prepares you for Week 12 when you'll present with minimal notes."

**Q: "Do we get graded on whether our proposal idea is good?"**
A: "No. Today is NOT graded on idea quality. We're practicing delivery skills—voice, pacing, eye contact, anxiety management. Your idea can be rough; your delivery should show effort. Participation is graded (presenting = participating), but the idea itself is not evaluated today."

**Q: "What if I completely blank and forget what I was going to say?"**
A: "Pause, take a breath, glance at your note card. Silence for 3-5 seconds feels long to you but is fine for the audience. If you truly can't continue, acknowledge it briefly—'Let me regroup'—then refer to your notes and continue. Recovery is part of the skill. We've all been there."

**Q: "Can I present to a small group instead of the whole class?"**
A: "Today's format is presenting to the full class because that's closer to the Week 12 setting and builds the skill of addressing larger audiences. If you have severe anxiety, see me after class and we can discuss accommodations, but challenge yourself today—this is a safe space to practice."

**Q: "What if my proposal idea overlaps with someone else's?"**
A: "That's fine—two people can present on sustainability or training programs. The focus is on YOUR delivery and how YOU frame the problem/solution, not the uniqueness of the idea."

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Class is very quiet during feedback session—no one volunteers comments
**Solution:**
- Use think-pair-share first: "Turn to your neighbor. Share one delivery technique you noticed in [Presenter]'s pitch—voice, pacing, eye contact, gestures. Then we'll hear from a few pairs."
- Cold-call gently: "Linh, what did you write on your feedback form for [Presenter]'s delivery strengths?"
- Model extensively: Give detailed feedback yourself first to show what "good feedback" looks like—specific observations tied to rubric criteria

**Issue:** A student refuses to present due to extreme anxiety
**Solution:**
- Private conversation: Pull them aside during prep time or break. Ask: "What specifically feels overwhelming? Is it the topic, the audience size, language concerns?"
- Offer accommodations: "Would it help to go last, after seeing all examples? Or to present to just me after class for participation credit?"
- Document: If they persistently refuse despite accommodations, note for participation grade and inform lead instructor. Severe CA may require academic support services.

**Issue:** Presentations are running long and you won't finish in time
**Solution:**
- Tighten feedback session: Reduce to 4 presenters with 90 seconds feedback each
- Skip mid-session break if necessary
- For future sessions: Reduce prep time to 5 minutes if students don't need full 7

**Issue:** Students are reading full scripts instead of presenting conversationally
**Solution:**
- Intervene during prep: "I notice you're writing full sentences. Try just key words: 'Problem: plastic waste = $X cost.' 'Solution: 3-bin recycling.' 'Ask: $5K budget approval.' Trust yourself to fill in language spontaneously."
- In feedback: "When you relied on your outline instead of reading, your delivery felt more authentic and engaging. That's the goal—structured spontaneity."

**Issue:** Feedback becomes debate about proposal idea viability instead of delivery focus
**Solution:**
- Redirect immediately: "Great engagement with the IDEA, but let's keep feedback on DELIVERY today. We're coaching presentation skills—voice, pacing, presence. Idea refinement happens in writing."
- Reinforce: "The rubric for Week 12 grades delivery separately from content. Today we're building delivery skills. Content depth comes later."

**Issue:** A student finishes their pitch in under 60 seconds
**Solution:**
- Note it, but don't interrupt. After they finish: "You completed in about 50 seconds—you have the full 2 minutes. This suggests you can expand your points with examples or evidence. Practice using full time."
- In feedback session: "If you finish early, it's feedback that your points need expansion. For Week 7 written proposal, add details. For Week 12 presentation, practice sustaining attention for full allocated time."

## Success Indicators for This Session

By the end of tutorial, students should:
- Have delivered one complete 2-minute proposal pitch
- Received specific feedback on delivery techniques (voice, pacing, eye contact)
- Observed peers managing anxiety in diverse ways
- Understand how oral pitch practice prepares for written proposal (Week 7) AND formal presentation (Week 12)
- Feel slightly more confident about presenting under pressure than at session start

**Red Flags (Require Follow-Up):**
- Student experiences panic attack or severe anxiety symptoms during presentation (refer to student support services)
- Student refuses to participate despite encouragement and accommodations (affects participation grade; may indicate need for academic support)
- Feedback becomes personal, hurtful, or focuses on idea critique rather than delivery coaching
- Entire session finishes in <70 minutes (indicates insufficient practice or rushed presentations)
- Students disengage during others' presentations (check for clear norms about respectful audience behavior)

---

## Connection to Upcoming Assessments

**Week 7 Persuasive Proposal (Written):**
- Students who presented proposal ideas today have tested core concepts orally
- Encourage them to use peer feedback to refine problem framing or solution clarity
- Oral practice often reveals logical gaps that need addressing in written version

**Week 12 Group Presentation (Oral + Q&A):**
- Today builds foundational confidence for higher-stakes presentation
- Anxiety management techniques practiced today (breathing, visualization, confident delivery) directly transfer
- Students practice Delivery & Presence criteria (25% of Group Presentation grade) in safe environment

**Instructor Follow-Up:**
- If students presented compelling proposal ideas today, note them for potential exemplars in Week 7 grading calibration
- If specific students struggled significantly with anxiety, offer office hours support or refer to academic counseling
