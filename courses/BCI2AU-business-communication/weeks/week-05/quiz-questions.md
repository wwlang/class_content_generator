    topic: "Duarte's Three-Act Story Structure"

    question: |
      What are the three acts in Duarte's presentation structure?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Beginning (What Is), Middle (What Could Be), End (New Bliss)"
        feedback: "Correct! These three acts form the narrative foundation of Duarte's framework."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Introduction, Body, Conclusion"
        feedback: "Incorrect. While similar, Duarte's framework uses specific terminology tied to narrative storytelling."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Problem, Evidence, Solution"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This describes a logical structure, not Duarte's three-act framework."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Hook, Main Points, Summary"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are presentation components, not Duarte's three acts."

    general_feedback: |
      Duarte's framework adapts Hollywood **narrative structure** (storytelling with beginning, middle, end) for presentations. Act 1 (Beginning) establishes **"What Is"** (current reality). Act 2 (Middle) oscillates between problems and solutions (**"What Could Be"**). Act 3 (End) paints the future vision (**"New Bliss"**). This structure creates **emotional engagement** (connection based on feeling, not just facts) through contrast and transformation. See Week 5 slides 6-9.

    topic: "Duarte's Three-Act Story Structure"

    question: |
      How does the middle act differ from the beginning and end in Duarte's structure?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "The middle oscillates between problem (What Is) and solution (What Could Be), creating contrast and emotional engagement"
        feedback: "Correct! Oscillation distinguishes the middle act from the beginning (problem only) and end (solution only)."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "The middle contains the most time but is the least important part of the presentation"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The middle may contain most time, but oscillation makes it central to engagement."

      - key: "C"
        text: "The middle transitions smoothly from problem to solution without repetition"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Duarte's approach specifically uses repetition (oscillation) between states."

      - key: "D"
        text: "The middle allows audience questions and interactions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Oscillation between problem and solution is the distinguishing feature, not audience interaction."

    general_feedback: |
      The middle act uses the **Sparkline™** pattern—a visual representation of wave-like **oscillation** (repeated back-and-forth movement between two states). Contrast is key: alternating between "What Is" (problem, trough) and "What Could Be" (solution, peak) creates **cognitive tension** (mental engagement through unresolved contrasts) that maintains attention. The middle act limits points to 3-5 maximum following the MECE principle (**Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**—no overlaps, no gaps). See Week 5 slides 8.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Duarte's Three-Act Story Structure"

    question: |
      Which components comprise the end act in Duarte's framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Synthesis of transformation, inspiration with vision, specific call to action, and S.T.A.R. moment"
        feedback: "Correct! These four components work together to create a memorable conclusion."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Summary of main points, thank you, and Q&A open"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are housekeeping tasks, not Duarte's framework components."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Restatement of the problem and evidence of the solution"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The end focuses on transformation and inspiration, not restatement."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Apology for any unclear points and request for feedback"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Duarte's ending does not include apologies or feedback requests."

    general_feedback: |
      Duarte's ending has four components: (1) **Synthesize**—show the complete transformation journey (not just bullet-point recap); (2) **Inspire**—paint an emotional, vivid vision of success; (3) **Call to Action**—provide ONE specific, achievable next step; (4) **S.T.A.R. Moment**—something memorable (a demo, prop, story, or statistic). The end act takes 10-15% of presentation time. Key distinction: Duarte's ending **moves audiences toward action**, not just retention of information. See Week 5 slides 9.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "Opening Elements (Hook, Context, Stakes)"

    question: |
      What are the four essential elements of a strong presentation opening?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Hook, Relevance, Credibility, Roadmap"
        feedback: "Correct! These four elements work together to engage and orient the audience."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Greeting, Topic, Outline, Questions"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are procedural steps, not the strategic opening elements."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Story, Statistics, Examples, Conclusion"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are types of evidence, not the four opening elements."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Context, Problem, Solution, Timeline"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The four elements are Hook, Relevance, Credibility, and Roadmap."

    general_feedback: |
      An effective opening uses four **strategic elements**: (1) **Hook**—grab attention with something surprising (a statistic, question, story, or bold claim); (2) **Relevance**—answer "Why does this matter to THIS audience?" by connecting to their context; (3) **Credibility**—briefly establish your **authority** (credentials, research, experience) in one sentence; (4) **Roadmap**—preview the structure so audiences can form a mental framework. The first 30 seconds are **critical**—audiences unconsciously decide whether to listen or disengage. The opening comprises 10-15% of total presentation time. See Week 5 slides 7.

  - id: "W5-Q5-opening-hook-vs-relevance"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Opening Elements (Hook, Context, Stakes)"

    question: |
      How do Hook and Relevance differ in their roles within a presentation opening?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Hook creates initial attention; Relevance establishes why the topic matters to the specific audience"
        feedback: "Correct! These serve distinct but complementary functions in engaging the audience."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Hook uses statistics; Relevance uses stories"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both elements can use various formats (statistics, stories, questions)."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Hook is for engaging audiences; Relevance is for establishing credibility"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Credibility is a separate element. Hook engages; Relevance motivates."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Hook must come last; Relevance must come first"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Hook comes first (to grab attention), then Relevance, then Credibility, then Roadmap."

    general_feedback: |
      **Hook** serves an **attentional function**—it captures immediate audience notice by being surprising or compelling. **Relevance** serves a **motivational function**—it answers "So what?" and deepens audience investment by connecting to their specific context. Example contrast: Poor opening: "Today I'll discuss digital marketing" (no hook, no relevance). Strong opening: "Vietnamese businesses waste $2 million per day on ineffective digital ads. I studied 200 local SMEs—today I'll show you three changes that triple ROI in 90 days" (hooks with shocking stat, establishes relevance to local business context). Together, they create both immediate engagement and sustained interest. See Week 5 slides 7.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "Opening Elements (Hook, Context, Stakes)"

    question: |
      How does Roadmap differ from the other three opening elements?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Roadmap is structural (previews organization), while Hook engages, Relevance motivates, and Credibility establishes trust"
        feedback: "Correct! Roadmap serves an organizational/scaffolding function distinct from engagement, motivation, and credibility."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Roadmap must be longer than Hook, Relevance, or Credibility"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Length is not the distinguishing feature. Roadmap's function is previewing structure."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Roadmap can be done at any point in the presentation, not just the opening"
        feedback: "Incorrect. All four elements belong in the opening to establish foundation for the entire presentation."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Roadmap is optional; the other three elements are essential"
        feedback: "Incorrect. All four elements work together. Roadmap is essential for reducing audience anxiety."

    general_feedback: |
      **Hook** attracts attention, **Relevance** motivates engagement, **Credibility** builds trust—these three create an emotional/relational foundation. **Roadmap** provides **cognitive scaffolding** (mental structure that helps organize information)—it previews what comes next so audiences can anticipate structure. The lecture notes roadmap "reduces audience anxiety" because uncertainty creates mental load. Together, the four elements serve: emotional (Hook), motivational (Relevance), relational (Credibility), and **cognitive** (mental/thinking-related) functions. See Week 5 slides 7.

    topic: "McCroskey's Communication Apprehension"

    question: |
      How does McCroskey define Communication Apprehension in relation to communication contexts?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "It is an individual's fear or anxiety specifically in public speaking situations only"
        feedback: "Incorrect. McCroskey's definition includes anxiety 'with another person or persons'—multiple contexts, not just public speaking."

      - key: "B"
        text: "It is an individual's level of fear or anxiety associated with real or anticipated communication in any context with others"
        feedback: "Correct! McCroskey's definition encompasses communication anxiety across all interpersonal and public situations."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "It is a permanent personality trait that cannot change over time"
        feedback: "Incorrect. McCroskey's framework distinguishes between trait (enduring) and state (situational) CA."

      - key: "D"
        text: "It is equivalent to general anxiety or shyness"
        feedback: "Incorrect. McCroskey's definition is specific to communication contexts, not general personality traits."

    general_feedback: |
      **Communication Apprehension (CA)** is McCroskey's term for anxiety arising in **interpersonal and public communication contexts**. Key insight: CA is **context-specific**—it's tied to communication situations, not a general personality trait. Example: You might be calm in one-on-one conversation but anxious presenting to a large group. McCroskey's research (21,655+ citations) demonstrates 10-20% of people experience significant CA. Critical reframe: CA is normal, not a personal failing. The lecture states: "If you feel nervous presenting, you're in good company." See Week 5 slides 14-15.

    topic: "McCroskey's Communication Apprehension"

    question: |
      How do Trait CA and State CA differ in their characteristics?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Trait CA is enduring across contexts; State CA is temporary and triggered by specific situations"
        feedback: "Correct! This captures the core distinction between personality tendency and situational response."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Trait CA is more severe than State CA"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Severity and type are independent. Both can range from mild to severe."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Trait CA affects introverts; State CA affects extroverts"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both types affect all personality types."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Trait CA happens before presentations; State CA happens during"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both types can occur before and during communication."

    general_feedback: |
      **Trait CA** is a **dispositional characteristic**—a stable personality tendency toward anxiety across most communication situations. **State CA** is **episodic and situational**—triggered by specific high-stakes contexts. Example: A student with low trait CA might still experience high state CA before a board presentation. Treatment differs: Trait CA requires long-term skills training and possibly therapy; State CA requires **situation-specific strategies** (breathing, visualization, preparation). Understanding which type applies to you guides the appropriate intervention. Most people have state CA (nervous for presentations) but low CA in casual settings. See Week 5 slides 15.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "McCroskey's Communication Apprehension"

    question: |
      What are the four communication contexts that McCroskey identified in his framework?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Public speaking, Group discussions, Meetings, Dyadic (one-on-one)"
        feedback: "Correct! McCroskey's framework recognizes CA varies across these four distinct contexts."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Formal, Informal, Professional, Personal"
        feedback: "Incorrect. McCroskey's four contexts are specific communication situations, not formality levels."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Planned, Spontaneous, Virtual, In-person"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The four contexts are defined by communication structure, not timing or medium."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Small group, Large group, Leadership, Peer-to-peer"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The four contexts are Public speaking, Group discussions, Meetings, and Dyadic."

    general_feedback: |
      McCroskey identified four communication contexts where CA manifests: (1) **Public speaking** (presentations, speeches to audiences), (2) **Group discussions** (conversations within teams), (3) **Meetings** (formal work gatherings), (4) **Dyadic** (one-on-one conversations). Critically, CA is **context-dependent**—anxiety levels shift across these situations. A person might have high CA in public speaking but low CA in dyadic conversation. This **context-specificity** is foundational to McCroskey's theory. Understanding which contexts trigger YOUR anxiety enables **targeted interventions** specific to problem areas. See Week 5 slides 15.

  - id: "W5-Q10-amp-three-categories"
    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "AMP Model (Anxiety Management Plan)"

    question: |
      How do Physical, Mental, and Practical Preparation in the AMP differ in their approach to managing anxiety?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "They each address the same anxiety response through identical techniques"
        feedback: "Incorrect. The three categories use different mechanisms: Physical targets physiology, Mental targets cognition, Practical targets readiness."

      - key: "B"
        text: "Physical targets body responses, Mental targets thought patterns, Practical targets actual readiness through preparation"
        feedback: "Correct! Each category addresses anxiety through a different system or mechanism."
        correct: true

      - key: "C"
        text: "Physical is for severe anxiety; Mental is for moderate; Practical is for mild"
        feedback: "Incorrect. All three approaches benefit people at all anxiety levels."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Only one approach is effective; the others are unnecessary"
        feedback: "Incorrect. All three work synergistically—together they're more effective than any single approach."

    general_feedback: |
      The **Anxiety Management Plan (AMP)** divides anxiety reduction into three complementary categories: (1) **Physical Preparation**—techniques like 4-7-8 breathing, power posing, hydration that target physiological responses; (2) **Mental Preparation**—visualization, **cognitive reframing** (changing interpretation of a situation), affirmations that target thought processes; (3) **Practical Preparation**—aloud rehearsal 3-5 times, anticipating Q&A, arriving early to check the room. These three work **synergistically** (combined effect is greater than individual parts). The lecture emphasizes none works alone—all three together create sustainable anxiety management. Research-backed by Matt Abrahams (Stanford GSB) and McCroskey's anxiety frameworks. See Week 5 slides 16.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "understanding"
    topic: "AMP Model (Anxiety Management Plan)"

    question: |
      How do Physical and Mental Preparation approaches address anxiety through different mechanisms?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Physical targets the body's response through physiological techniques; Mental targets the mind's interpretation through reframing"
        feedback: "Correct! These two approaches work on different systems to manage anxiety."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Physical preparation is quick; Mental preparation takes longer"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both approaches can be completed in minutes."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Physical is for anxious people; Mental is for confident people"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Both approaches benefit everyone regardless of baseline confidence levels."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Physical addresses body language; Mental addresses what you say"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Physical addresses physiological symptoms, not body language mechanics."

    general_feedback: |
      **Physical Preparation** interrupts the **physiological cascade** (automatic chain of physical reactions) of anxiety—elevated heart rate, shallow breathing, muscle tension—through 4-7-8 breathing (which activates the **parasympathetic nervous system**, the body's calming mechanism) and power posing (which reduces cortisol, the stress hormone). **Mental Preparation** alters **cognitive appraisal** (the mind's interpretation of circumstances)—the way you interpret bodily sensations. Key insight: anxiety and excitement share nearly identical **physiological states** (elevated heart rate, energy). Reframing—mentally interpreting "I'm excited" instead of "I'm scared"—changes interpretation without changing your body. Research from Alison Wood Brooks (HBS) shows this reframing significantly improves performance. See Week 5 slides 16.

    type: "multiple_choice"
    bloom_level: "remembering"
    topic: "AMP Model (Anxiety Management Plan)"

    question: |
      Which of the following is an example of Practical Preparation in the Anxiety Management Plan?

    options:
      - key: "A"
        text: "Rehearsing the presentation aloud 3-5 times, anticipating Q&A questions, and arriving early to check the room"
        feedback: "Correct! These three actions comprise the practical preparation component of the AMP."
        correct: true

      - key: "B"
        text: "Taking deep breaths and doing a power pose before presenting"
        feedback: "Incorrect. Deep breathing and power posing are Physical Preparation techniques, not Practical."

      - key: "C"
        text: "Visualizing success and reframing anxiety as excitement"
        feedback: "Incorrect. These are Mental Preparation techniques, not Practical."

      - key: "D"
        text: "Avoiding presentation thoughts until you're in front of the audience"
        feedback: "Incorrect. This is avoidance, not preparation. Practical preparation requires active rehearsal and anticipation."

    general_feedback: |
      **Practical Preparation** includes concrete actions that build **genuine confidence** through readiness: (1) **Rehearse aloud** 3-5 full run-throughs (not silent reading—speaking aloud engages **muscle memory**, physical patterns you build through repetition), (2) **Anticipate Q&A**—prepare answers for likely questions to reduce surprise, (3) **Arrive early**—familiarize yourself with the room and test **equipment** (technology that will be used). The lecture states: "Confidence comes from preparation—you can't fake it." Practical preparation differs from Physical/Mental because it creates actual **competence** and **mastery** (real skill development). All three AMP components work together synergistically. See Week 5 slides 16.
