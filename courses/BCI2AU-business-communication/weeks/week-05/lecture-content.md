**Course:** BCI2AU Business Communication
**Topic:** Building Presentation Confidence
**Assessment Connection:** Foundation for Group Presentation (Week 12)

---

## Slide 1: Opening Hook
<!-- LAYOUT: big-number -->

## 85% of Job Success Depends on Communication Skills

**Only 15% comes from technical knowledge**

(Carnegie Institute of Technology, replicated across 70+ studies)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- Welcome students back. "We've mastered written communication—now we turn to oral."
- Let this statistic sink in for a moment of silence

**Key Points:**
- Original Carnegie study from 1918, but finding replicated consistently
- Technical skills get you the interview; communication skills get you promoted
- Today we tackle the skill that causes the most anxiety but offers the biggest career impact

**Example:**
- In Vietnam's competitive job market, technical skills are baseline—everyone has them
- Top companies (Vingroup, FPT, Viettel) explicitly test presentation skills in final interview rounds
- The differentiator is not what you know, but how clearly you can explain it to others

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick show of hands—who feels completely confident presenting to a group?"
- (Expect few hands—normalize this as we'll address it today)

**Transition:**
- "If you're nervous, you're in good company. Let's see what we'll accomplish today..."

---

## Slide 2: Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Structure** a presentation using the three-part framework (opening, body, conclusion)
2. **Apply** delivery techniques to enhance voice, pacing, and eye contact
3. **Implement** anxiety management strategies grounded in Communication Apprehension Theory
4. **Develop** authentic presence that builds audience connection

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Four concrete skills you'll practice today and in tutorial"

**Key Points:**
- **Structure:** We'll use Nancy Duarte's framework from *Resonate* (used at Stanford GSB)
- **Delivery:** Voice modulation, pacing, eye contact—the basics that carry 80% of impact
- **Anxiety:** McCroskey's Communication Apprehension Theory—the scientific foundation for managing nervousness
- **Authenticity:** How to be yourself, not perform a character

**Example:**
- By Week 12, you'll deliver a 15-minute group presentation with Q&A
- Today's foundation makes that achievable, not terrifying

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which of these four feels most challenging to you right now?"
- (Listen for trends—anxiety usually dominates)

**Transition:**
- "Let's connect this to your upcoming assessment..."

---

## Slide 3: How This Prepares You for Assessment
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Week 12 Group Presentation (25% + 15% Individual)

**Timeline:**
- **Week 5 (Today):** Learn structure and delivery fundamentals
- **Week 5 Tutorial:** Practice 2-3 minute mini-presentations with peer feedback
- **Week 6:** Visual communication and slide design
- **Week 7:** Storytelling and persuasion techniques
- **Week 12:** Deliver 15-minute group presentation + 10-minute Q&A

**What makes the difference:**
- Structure clarity (today's focus)
- Confident delivery (today's focus)
- Visual support (next week)
- Persuasive narrative (Week 7)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Your final presentation is seven weeks away—plenty of time to build confidence"

**Key Points:**
- Today is **foundational**—structure and delivery are prerequisites for everything else
- Tutorial gives you safe space to practice with only 20 peers, not a formal grade
- Each week builds: structure → visuals → storytelling → Q&A handling → final delivery
- Individual grade (15%) assesses YOUR contribution within the group

**Example:**
- Think of it like learning to drive: today you learn steering and braking (fundamentals)
- Later weeks add highway driving and parallel parking (advanced skills)
- By Week 12, you'll be ready for the road test

**Check Understanding:**
- "How many of you have delivered a 15-minute presentation before?"
- (Note the mix—acknowledge both experienced and first-timers)

**Transition:**
- "Let's see the roadmap for today's journey..."

---

## Slide 4: Today's Roadmap
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Three Segments

1. **Presentation Structure** (20 minutes)
   Opening, body, conclusion frameworks

2. **Delivery Fundamentals** (20 minutes)
   Voice, pacing, eye contact, presence

3. **Managing Anxiety & Finding Authenticity** (20 minutes)
   Scientific strategies for confidence

---

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Three clear segments, each about 20 minutes, with mini-activities to practice"

**Key Points:**
- Structure comes first because it reduces anxiety—knowing what to say next calms nerves
- Delivery techniques are mechanical—you can practice and improve them
- Anxiety management is last because once you have structure and technique, fear diminishes

**Example:**
- Like building a house: foundation (structure) → walls (delivery) → interior design (authenticity)

**Check Understanding:**
- "Any questions before we dive into segment one?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's start with structure—the foundation that everything else builds on..."

---

## Slide 5: Segment 1 - Presentation Structure
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Why Structure Matters

"The audience did not show up to see you. They came to find out what you can do for them."
— Nancy Duarte, *Resonate*

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "First mindset shift: presentations aren't about you—they're about the audience"

**Key Points:**
- Nancy Duarte created Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth* presentation
- Her firm has advised Google, Apple, Cisco on major product launches
- *Resonate* is taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business
- The quote reframes anxiety: it's not performance, it's service

**Example:**
- When Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, he wasn't showing off
- He was demonstrating how the iPhone would transform the audience's lives
- The presentation positioned the **audience as heroes**, Jobs as their guide

**Check Understanding:**
- "What changes when you think of yourself as a guide, not a performer?"
- (Expected: less pressure, more focus on helping)

**Transition:**
- "So how do we structure a presentation that serves the audience? Three parts..."

---

## Slide 6: Duarte's Three-Act Presentation Structure
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Beginning → Middle → End

**ACT 1: BEGINNING**
- Establish "What Is" (current reality, problem)
- Introduce the gap between current and ideal state

**ACT 2: MIDDLE**
- Oscillate between "What Is" and "What Could Be"
- Build tension with increasing stakes
- Provide evidence, examples, solutions

**ACT 3: END**
- Paint the "New Bliss"—the transformed future state
- Call to action—specific next steps for audience

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This three-act structure comes from Hollywood screenwriting, adapted for business"

**Key Points:**
- **Beginning:** Don't start with "Hi, I'm..." Start with the problem or opportunity
- **Middle:** Contrast creates engagement—alternate between problem and solution
- **End:** Don't just summarize—inspire action with a vision of success

**Example:**
- Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech is a perfect example:
  - Beginning: Current injustice ("What Is")
  - Middle: Alternates between current struggles and future vision
  - End: The dream fully realized ("New Bliss")

**Check Understanding:**
- "Think of a presentation you've seen—can you identify these three acts?"

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down the beginning—your opening is critical..."

---

## Slide 7: Crafting Your Opening (Act 1)
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Four Elements of a Strong Opening

1. **Hook** - Grab attention (statistic, question, story, bold claim)
2. **Relevance** - Why this matters to THIS audience
3. **Credibility** - Why you're qualified to speak on this
4. **Roadmap** - Where we're going (preview structure)

**Time Allocation:** 10-15% of total presentation time

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "First 30 seconds determine if the audience listens or checks their phones"

**Key Points:**
- **Hook:** Start with something surprising or provocative, not "Good morning, my name is..."
- **Relevance:** Answer "So what?" immediately—why should they care?
- **Credibility:** Brief—one sentence establishing your authority (experience, research, etc.)
- **Roadmap:** Reduces audience anxiety—they know what to expect

**Example (Poor Opening):**
- "Hi, I'm Minh. Today I'll talk about digital marketing. I'll cover three topics: SEO, social media, and email. Let's begin with SEO..."
- (Boring, generic, no hook)

**Example (Strong Opening):**
- "Vietnamese businesses waste $2 million per day on ineffective digital ads. I spent six months analyzing 200 Hanoi SMEs—today I'll show you three changes that can triple your ROI in 90 days."
- (Hook: shocking stat. Relevance: local context. Credibility: research. Roadmap: three changes)

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between these two openings?"
- (Expected: specificity, relevance, energy)

**Transition:**
- "Once you've hooked them, you move to the middle—the heart of your presentation..."

---

## Slide 8: Structuring Your Middle (Act 2)
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## The Sparkline™ Pattern: Oscillation Creates Engagement

**"What Is" ↔ "What Could Be"**

- **What Is:** Current problems, limitations, pain points
- **What Could Be:** Future possibilities, solutions, benefits

**Why it works:** Contrast creates emotional tension that maintains attention

**Structure:**
- 3-5 main points maximum
- Each point follows: Problem → Solution → Evidence → Example
- Oscillate between current reality and better future

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "The middle is where most presenters lose their audience—here's how to keep them engaged"

**Key Points:**
- Duarte's "Sparkline" diagram visualizes this oscillation as a wave
- Each trough is "what is" (problem), each peak is "what could be" (solution)
- Maximum 3-5 main points—more than that, audience forgets
- Use the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)—no overlap, no gaps

**Example:**
- Steve Jobs' iPhone launch (2007):
  - "What Is": Existing phones are hard to use, three separate devices (phone, iPod, internet)
  - "What Could Be": iPhone combines all three, revolutionary touch interface
  - He repeated this pattern for every feature—problem with old, solution with new

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why does oscillation work better than listing solutions without showing problems first?"
- (Expected: creates need, emotional engagement, shows impact)

**Transition:**
- "Now the critical part—how do you end memorably?"

---

## Slide 9: Closing with Impact (Act 3)
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## The "New Bliss" Ending

1. **Synthesize** - Recap the transformation (not just bullet points)
2. **Inspire** - Paint the vision of success if they take action
3. **Call to Action** - ONE specific, achievable next step
4. **S.T.A.R. Moment** - Something They'll Always Remember

**Time Allocation:** 10-15% of total presentation time

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Your ending determines what the audience remembers and whether they act"

**Key Points:**
- **Synthesize:** Don't just repeat bullets—show the transformation journey
- **Inspire:** Emotional appeal—what does success feel like?
- **Call to Action:** Must be specific—not "think about this" but "sign up by Friday"
- **S.T.A.R. Moment:** Memorable element—demo, prop, powerful story, shocking stat

**Example (S.T.A.R. Moments):**
- Bill Gates released mosquitoes during a TED talk about malaria—unforgettable
- A student presenting on plastic pollution brought a jar of microplastics from a Vietnamese beach
- Your Group Presentation (Week 12) should include one memorable moment

**Example (Strong Closing):**
- "Imagine six months from now: your digital ads reach 10,000 engaged customers, your cost-per-click drops 60%, and your revenue doubles. This isn't fantasy—it's what happened to 47 of the 200 businesses I studied. Your next step: implement the three-keyword strategy I shared today. Start with one campaign this week. Who's ready to begin?"

**Check Understanding:**
- "What makes this closing more effective than 'In conclusion, digital marketing is important'?"
- (Expected: specific vision, concrete action, urgency)

**Transition:**
- "You've got structure—now let's add delivery skills to bring it to life..."

---

## Slide 10: Segment 2 - Delivery Fundamentals
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Beyond the Words: How You Say It Matters

**Mehrabian's Communication Formula (Often Misapplied):**
- 7% Words (what you say)
- 38% Vocal Tone (how you say it)
- 55% Body Language (what you do while saying it)

**Reality:** The ratio applies to emotional communication, not all communication. BUT the principle holds: **delivery amplifies or undermines your message.**

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "You've probably seen this 7-38-55 formula—it's often misquoted"

**Key Points:**
- Mehrabian's original research was about conveying feelings and attitudes, not factual information
- The real takeaway: When your words and delivery conflict, audiences believe your delivery
- If you say "I'm excited about this opportunity" in a monotone voice with slumped shoulders, they don't believe you
- For business presentations: content matters, but delivery determines credibility

**Example:**
- Two students present identical slide decks on market analysis
- Student A: monotone, reads slides, no eye contact → perceived as unprepared
- Student B: varied pace, engages audience, confident posture → perceived as expert
- Same content, different delivery, dramatically different results

**Check Understanding:**
- "Have you ever doubted a speaker's message because their delivery felt 'off'?"
- (Expected: yes—mismatched tone, nervous habits distracted)

**Transition:**
- "Let's break down delivery into three components you can control..."

---

## Slide 11: Voice Modulation & Pacing
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Vocal Delivery Techniques

**1. PACE**
- **Ideal:** 130-170 words per minute (conversational)
- **Too fast:** Anxious, hard to follow
- **Too slow:** Boring, loses energy
- **Strategic variation:** Speed up for excitement, slow down for emphasis

**2. VOLUME**
- Project to the back row (diaphragm breathing, not throat)
- Vary for emphasis: louder for key points, softer for intimacy

**3. PITCH**
- Avoid monotone—vary pitch naturally as in conversation
- Downward inflection for statements (confidence)
- Upward inflection for questions only (not statements—sounds uncertain)

**4. PAUSES**
- Strategic silence = emphasis
- Pause after key points (3-5 seconds lets audience absorb)
- Pause instead of filler words ("um," "uh," "like")

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Voice is your instrument—you can train it just like any skill"

**Key Points:**
- **Pacing:** Practice with a timer. Record yourself—most speakers talk faster when nervous
- **Volume:** In Vietnamese culture, soft-spokenness is valued—but in presentations, you must project
- **Pitch:** Monotone is the #1 complaint in student presentations—vary naturally
- **Pauses:** Silence feels longer to you than the audience. Count to three after major points.

**Example (Demonstrate):**
- Say this sentence in monotone: "This is the most important point of the presentation."
- Now say it with variation: "THIS... is the MOST important point... of the presentation." (pause after each segment)
- The second version commands attention through vocal variety

**Check Understanding:**
- "Let's practice: Everyone say 'This is important' in a monotone. Now say it like you mean it."
- (Get class participation—hear the difference)

**Transition:**
- "Voice is half the equation—the other half is what the audience sees..."

---

## Slide 12: Eye Contact & Body Language
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Non-Verbal Communication Essentials

**EYE CONTACT**
- Western Standard: 3-5 seconds per person, scan the room
- Vietnamese Context: Direct eye contact with elders/authority can be uncomfortable
- **Adaptation:** Focus on foreheads or friendly faces if direct eye contact feels invasive

**POSTURE**
- Stand tall, feet shoulder-width apart
- Avoid: Crossed arms, hands in pockets, slouching
- Power pose before presenting (2 minutes) reduces cortisol, increases testosterone (Amy Cuddy)

**GESTURES**
- Natural, purposeful movements above waist
- Avoid: Fidgeting, pointing aggressively, repetitive gestures

**MOVEMENT**
- Strategic movement (e.g., step forward for emphasis) vs. pacing nervously
- Stay within "engagement zone" (don't hide behind podium)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Your body communicates even when you're silent"

**Key Points:**
- **Eye Contact:** In Vietnam, prolonged eye contact with authority figures can signal disrespect
- For presentations: Balance—don't stare down elders, but don't avoid all eye contact
- **Posture:** Amy Cuddy's TED talk on power posing—2 minutes in power pose before presenting reduces anxiety
- **Gestures:** Hands visible (builds trust), above waist (professional), natural (not robotic)
- **Movement:** Walk toward audience for key point, step back for transitions

**Example:**
- Vietnamese students often stand very still with hands clasped—appears nervous
- Best approach: Hands relaxed at sides or gesturing naturally, slight movement when transitioning topics

**Cultural Note:**
- In Vietnam, showing too much confidence can be seen as arrogant (cultural emphasis on humility)
- In presentations: You can be humble AND confident—acknowledge your audience, share credit, but deliver with conviction

**Check Understanding:**
- "What body language signals confidence vs. nervousness?"
- (Expected: open vs. closed posture, steady vs. fidgeting)

**Transition:**
- "Now let's practice—quick activity..."

---

## Slide 13: Practice Activity - Delivery Essentials

## 90-Second Practice

**Instructions:**
1. Pair up with the person next to you
2. Choose a simple topic (your favorite food, a hobby, your hometown)
3. One person speaks for 90 seconds while the other observes
4. Observer notes: pacing, vocal variety, eye contact, gestures
5. Switch roles

**Focus:** Apply one technique from Slide 11 or 12

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Learning happens through practice—let's try delivery techniques right now"

**Key Points:**
- This is low-stakes—topic doesn't matter, just practicing technique
- Observer should look for ONE strength and ONE improvement area
- Time strictly: 90 seconds each (use phone timer)
- Then 30 seconds feedback, then switch

**Facilitation:**
- Set a timer visible to all
- Call time at 90 seconds, then 30 seconds for feedback
- After both partners go (4 minutes total), ask for volunteers to share insights

**Example:**
- "Who noticed themselves speaking faster than normal when nervous?"
- "Who discovered that pausing felt awkward but worked well?"

**Check Understanding:**
- After activity: "What was the hardest technique to apply?"
- (Expected: pausing, eye contact)

**Transition:**
- "Great work. You've got structure and delivery skills—now let's tackle the elephant in the room: anxiety..."

---

## Slide 14: Segment 3 - Managing Anxiety & Finding Authenticity
<!-- LAYOUT: section-break -->

## Communication Apprehension: The Science of Presentation Anxiety

**McCroskey's Definition (1977):**
"An individual's level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons."

**Key Insight:** 10-20% of individuals experience significant communication apprehension—**you're not alone, and it's not a character flaw.**

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "If you feel nervous before presenting, that's normal—here's the science"

**Key Points:**
- James McCroskey's 1977 paper is THE foundational work on communication anxiety
- His research has 21,655+ citations—every business school communication program references this
- **Communication Apprehension (CA)** is distinct from general anxiety—it's context-specific
- CA creates physiological response: increased heart rate, sweating, shallow breathing

**Example:**
- You might be perfectly comfortable talking one-on-one with a friend (low CA in dyadic context)
- But terrified of public speaking (high CA in public context)
- This is normal—different contexts trigger different responses

**Check Understanding:**
- "Quick poll: Who feels more nervous presenting to 100 people vs. having coffee with a friend?"
- (Expect nearly all hands—this validates the contextual nature of CA)

**Transition:**
- "Understanding CA is the first step—now let's learn how to manage it..."

---

## Slide 15: McCroskey's Communication Apprehension Framework
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Two Types of Communication Apprehension

**TRAIT CA (Enduring Personality)**
- Consistent anxiety across all communication situations
- Part of your temperament—relatively stable over time
- Example: You've always felt nervous speaking up in any group setting

**STATE CA (Situational Triggers)**
- Anxiety in specific, high-stakes situations
- Even confident communicators experience this
- Example: Calm in team meetings, anxious before board presentations

**Four Communication Contexts:**
1. Public speaking (presentations, speeches)
2. Group discussions (meetings, team settings)
3. Meetings (formal work gatherings)
4. Dyadic (one-on-one conversations)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "CA manifests differently for everyone—understanding your pattern helps you address it"

**Key Points:**
- **Trait CA:** If you have high trait CA, you need long-term strategies (skills training, therapy)
- **State CA:** If you have state CA, you need situation-specific strategies (preparation, breathing)
- Most people have state CA—nervous for big presentations but fine in casual settings
- **Four contexts:** You might have high CA in public speaking but low CA in dyadic—this is common

**Example:**
- Student A: High trait CA—nervous in all communication settings. Needs comprehensive support.
- Student B: Low trait CA, high state CA for presentations only. Needs presentation-specific techniques.
- Both are valid—different approaches needed

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which type of CA do you think you have—trait or state?"
- (Most will identify state CA—normalize this)

**Transition:**
- "Now that you know what you're dealing with, here are proven techniques to manage it..."

---

## Slide 16: Managing Communication Apprehension - Before Presenting
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Pre-Presentation Anxiety Management Plan (AMP)

**PHYSICAL PREPARATION (Reduces Physiological Symptoms)**
- **Breathing:** 4-7-8 technique (inhale 4 counts, hold 7, exhale 8) - lowers heart rate
- **Movement:** 2-minute power pose (Amy Cuddy) or light exercise to burn nervous energy
- **Hydration:** Water only (avoid caffeine—increases jitters)

**MENTAL PREPARATION (Reframes Cognitive Response)**
- **Visualization:** Picture yourself succeeding—walking to stage, engaging audience, receiving applause
- **Reframing:** Anxiety = excitement (same physiological state, different interpretation)
- **Affirmations:** Replace "I'm scared" with "I'm prepared and capable"

**PRACTICAL PREPARATION (Builds Confidence)**
- **Rehearse aloud:** 3-5 full run-throughs (not silent reading)
- **Anticipate questions:** Prepare answers for likely Q&A
- **Arrive early:** Familiarize yourself with room, test equipment

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "These techniques are research-backed from Matt Abrahams (Stanford GSB) and McCroskey's work"

**Key Points:**
- **Physical:** CA creates fight-or-flight response—breathing/movement resets nervous system
- **Mental:** Reframing anxiety as excitement is proven effective (Alison Wood Brooks, HBS research)
- **Practical:** Confidence comes from preparation—you can't fake it
- All three components work together—don't rely on just one

**Example:**
- Before your Week 12 Group Presentation:
  - Night before: Rehearse 3 times aloud, visualize success
  - Morning of: 4-7-8 breathing, power pose in bathroom
  - 10 min before: Arrive early, check slides, hydrate

**Cultural Note:**
- In Vietnamese culture, displaying anxiety openly can be stigmatized
- These techniques are private (breathing, visualization)—no one needs to know you're using them

**Check Understanding:**
- "Let's try the 4-7-8 breathing right now: Inhale through nose for 4... hold for 7... exhale for 8..."
- (Guide class through 2-3 cycles)

**Transition:**
- "That handles anxiety before—what about during the presentation?"

---

## Slide 17: Managing Anxiety During Presentation
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## In-the-Moment Techniques (Matt Abrahams, Stanford GSB)

**GROUNDING TECHNIQUES**
- **Focus on one friendly face** in the audience—present to them initially
- **Touch anchor object** (clicker, notes, podium)—physical grounding reduces mental spiraling
- **Slow down deliberately**—anxiety makes us rush, conscious slowing calms nerves

**STRUCTURAL ANCHORS**
- **Use frameworks** ("First... Second... Third...")—provides mental roadmap
- **Signpost transitions** ("Now that we've covered X, let's move to Y")—reduces anxiety about what's next

**RECOVERY FROM MISTAKES**
- **Pause, don't apologize**—audiences don't notice most mistakes
- **Acknowledge major errors briefly**—"Let me rephrase that"—then move on
- **Focus forward, not backward**—ruminating mid-presentation increases anxiety

**AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT (Reduces Self-Focus)**
- **Ask questions**—shifts attention to audience
- **Make eye contact**—builds connection, reduces isolation feeling
- **Read body language**—nodding heads signal you're on track

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Even experienced presenters feel nervous—these techniques help you perform despite anxiety"

**Key Points:**
- **Grounding:** Physical sensations interrupt anxiety spirals (research from mindfulness therapy)
- **Structural Anchors:** Frameworks like "What? So What? Now What?" provide mental scaffolding
- **Mistakes:** Audiences are forgiving—acknowledging briefly shows authenticity, dwelling shows insecurity
- **Engagement:** Anxiety is self-focused ("They're judging me")—shifting to audience reduces this

**Example (Mistake Recovery):**
- Poor: "Oh no, sorry, I messed up, let me start over, sorry, I'm so nervous..."
- Better: (Pause 2 seconds) "Let me clarify that point..." (Continue)
- The second approach shows confidence despite the error

**Example (Framework in Action):**
- Matt Abrahams' "What? So What? Now What?" framework:
  - What: State the point
  - So What: Why it matters
  - Now What: Action step
- Having this structure in mind means you never wonder "What do I say next?"

**Check Understanding:**
- "What would you do if you completely blanked mid-presentation?"
- (Expected: Pause, refer to notes, acknowledge briefly, move on)

**Transition:**
- "Managing anxiety is essential—but there's something even more powerful: authenticity..."

---

## Slide 18: Authenticity in Presentation - Beyond Performance
<!-- LAYOUT: quote -->

## "Authentic communication is contextual—what feels authentic varies by channel and audience."

— Alisa Brodsky, UT Austin McCombs (2022)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Final concept: the most powerful presenters aren't performers—they're authentic"

**Key Points:**
- Alisa Brodsky's research challenges simplistic "just be yourself" advice
- Authenticity doesn't mean identical behavior in all contexts—it means genuine intent adapted to situation
- In Vietnamese culture: Authenticity can conflict with cultural norms (e.g., humility vs. confidence)
- Resolution: You can be authentically humble while confidently delivering your message

**Example:**
- A Vietnamese student presenting to professors might adjust tone to show respect (cultural norm)
- But the content and intent remain authentic—this isn't "fake," it's contextual adaptation
- Contrast with fully scripted, memorized presentation delivered robotically—that feels inauthentic

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between adapting your style (authentic) and faking confidence (inauthentic)?"
- (Expected: Genuine intent vs. deception)

**Transition:**
- "How do you develop authentic presence? Three strategies..."

---

## Slide 19: Developing Authentic Presence
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## Three Paths to Authenticity

**1. FIND YOUR NATURAL STYLE**
- **Not:** Imitating TED speakers or professors
- **Instead:** What works for YOU in comfortable conversations?
- **Exercise:** Record yourself explaining a topic to a friend—note your natural energy, humor, pacing

**2. PREPARE DEEPLY, THEN RELEASE**
- **Not:** Memorizing scripts word-for-word (sounds robotic)
- **Instead:** Know your content so well you can be spontaneous within structure
- **Approach:** Rehearse key points and transitions, but let exact wording vary

**3. SHARE YOUR "WHY"**
- **Not:** Presenting facts without personal connection
- **Instead:** Briefly explain why this topic matters to YOU
- **Impact:** Audiences connect with passion and purpose, not perfection

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Authenticity isn't about being casual or unpolished—it's about being genuinely yourself"

**Key Points:**
- **Natural Style:** You already communicate authentically with friends—scale that to presentations
- **Prepare & Release:** Over-rehearsal creates rigidity. Under-rehearsal creates chaos. Balance is key.
- **Share Your Why:** 30 seconds of personal connection at the opening makes the entire presentation feel authentic

**Example (Sharing Your Why):**
- Generic: "Today I'll present on renewable energy in Vietnam."
- Authentic: "Growing up in Hanoi, I watched air quality worsen every year. That's why I researched renewable energy solutions—this topic isn't abstract to me, it's personal."
- The second approach invites emotional connection

**Cultural Note:**
- Vietnamese culture values humility—sharing personal stories can feel like bragging
- Reframe: Sharing your "why" isn't boasting, it's providing context for why you care
- You're not saying "I'm amazing," you're saying "This matters to me for these reasons"

**Check Understanding:**
- "What's a topic you feel genuinely passionate about? How would you share why it matters to you in 30 seconds?"
- (Invite 1-2 volunteers to share—model authentic openings)

**Transition:**
- "Let's see authenticity in action with a case study..."

---

## Slide 20: Case Study - Authentic Presentation Under Pressure
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Gabe: Tech Product Manager (Abrahams, 2023)

**Context:**
- Tech company product manager experiencing rapid career growth
- Became uncomfortable with increased visibility and performative demands when leading hundreds of employees

**Challenge:**
- High-stakes meetings requiring spontaneous, confident communication
- Anxiety about being "on" constantly

**Action:**
- Structured practice of impromptu speaking (athletic model—practice drills for unpredictable situations)
- Developed Anxiety Management Plan (AMP) addressing before/during/after communication
- Practiced "What? So What? Now What?" framework for spontaneous responses

**Result:**
- Built confidence in unscripted moments that define leadership perception
- Authenticity increased because structure reduced anxiety (less focused on fear, more on message)

**Lesson:** Preparation for spontaneity is not an oxymoron—it's essential for authentic presence

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "This case from Matt Abrahams' HBR article shows how structure enables authenticity"

**Key Points:**
- Gabe's anxiety came from feeling unprepared for spontaneous moments
- Solution wasn't "just relax"—it was structured practice of impromptu communication
- The "athletic model": Just as athletes dribble around cones to prepare for unpredictable games, communicators practice random prompts
- Result: Gabe felt more authentic because he wasn't paralyzed by anxiety

**Example (Athletic Practice Model):**
- Practice drill: Draw random topics from a deck, speak for 60 seconds using "What? So What? Now What?"
- Over time, you develop muscle memory for spontaneous structure
- This is what you'll do in tutorial today—mini-presentations with randomized prompts

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why does practicing spontaneity seem contradictory but actually work?"
- (Expected: Builds confidence, reduces fear, creates mental patterns)

**Transition:**
- "One more case—this time about channel selection and authenticity..."

## Slide 21: Case Study - Channel Selection for Authentic Communication
<!-- LAYOUT: case-study -->

## Brodsky's Channel-Authenticity Matrix (2022)

**Research Question:**
How do communication channels affect perceived authenticity in hybrid work?

**Key Finding:**
Different channels afford different levels of emotional expression—**strategic selection optimizes authenticity**

| Channel | Best When... | Authenticity Dynamics |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **In-person** | Your communication IS authentic; you want genuine emotional expression | Allows full nonverbal cues; authenticity easily perceived |
| **Video call** | You need presence but with slight emotional buffering | Provides visual connection with reduced intensity |
| **Phone/Audio** | You need to suppress or modulate emotional expression | Partial masking while maintaining vocal connection |
| **Email/Text** | You must communicate inauthentically OR other channels unavailable | Maximum control over message; reduced spontaneity cues |

**Application to Presentations:**
- **In-person presentations:** Full authenticity required—body language, eye contact, energy all visible
- **Virtual presentations (Zoom):** Slightly buffered—use this to your advantage if nervous
- **Recorded presentations:** Maximum control—can re-record, but may feel less authentic

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Post-COVID, many presentations happen virtually—this research helps you choose the right channel"

**Key Points:**
- Brodsky's research from UT Austin McCombs shows channel selection affects how authentic you seem
- In-person is highest bandwidth—best for important, emotional, or persuasive presentations
- Virtual provides a buffer—useful if you're still building confidence
- For your Week 12 presentation: It will likely be in-person, so practice in-person format

**Example:**
- Delivering difficult feedback:
  - In-person: Shows courage, builds trust, allows nuance
  - Video: Allows visual connection with slight emotional buffer
  - Email: Maximum control but lowest trust—feels like avoiding confrontation
- Choose based on message needs, not just convenience

**Check Understanding:**
- "Why might a nervous presenter actually prefer virtual presentations initially?"
- (Expected: Reduced intensity, less eye contact pressure, can use notes)

**Transition:**
- "Let's synthesize everything we've covered today..."

## Slide 22: Key Takeaways - Oral Communication Fundamentals
<!-- LAYOUT: framework -->

## What We've Learned Today

**1. STRUCTURE YOUR PRESENTATION (Duarte's Three Acts)**
- Beginning: Establish "What Is" and the gap
- Middle: Oscillate between problem and solution
- End: Paint the "New Bliss" and call to action

**2. DELIVER WITH IMPACT**
- Voice: Pace (130-170 wpm), volume, pitch variation, strategic pauses
- Body: Eye contact (adapted for culture), posture, gestures, movement

**3. MANAGE ANXIETY SCIENTIFICALLY (McCroskey & Abrahams)**
- Before: Breathing, power pose, visualization, rehearsal
- During: Grounding techniques, structural anchors, mistake recovery

**4. DEVELOP AUTHENTIC PRESENCE (Brodsky)**
- Find your natural style (not imitation)
- Prepare deeply, then release (avoid scripting)
- Share your "why" (personal connection)

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Four major concepts—let's recap how they fit together"

**Key Points:**
- **Structure** is the foundation—reduces anxiety because you know what comes next
- **Delivery** techniques amplify your message—voice and body work together
- **Anxiety management** makes everything possible—you can't deliver well if paralyzed by fear
- **Authenticity** ties it all together—technical skill + genuine presence = impact

**Example:**
- Imagine two students with identical presentations:
  - Student A: No structure, monotone, visibly anxious, reads slides
  - Student B: Clear three-act structure, vocal variety, calm presence, authentic connection
  - Same content, dramatically different impact

**Check Understanding:**
- "Which of these four areas do you most want to practice in tutorial today?"
- (Take informal poll—helps tutor prioritize)

**Transition:**
- "Speaking of tutorial—here's what you'll practice..."

## Slide 23: Tutorial Preview - Mini-Presentation Practice

## What You'll Do in Tutorial (90 Minutes)

**Quick Review (5 min):**
- Recap today's frameworks
- Review success criteria for effective presentations

**Main Activity (75 min):**
- **Task:** Deliver a 2-3 minute mini-presentation on assigned topic
- **Structure:** Apply three-act structure (opening, body, conclusion)
- **Delivery:** Practice voice modulation, eye contact, gestures
- **Feedback:** Peer observation using rubric criteria

**Before Next Class (10 min):**
- Complete Week 5 online quiz
- Pre-reading for Week 6 (Visual Communication)
- Save notes from peer feedback

**Goal:** Safe practice environment with constructive feedback—NOT graded, just learning

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Tutorial is where theory becomes skill—you'll practice everything we discussed today"

**Key Points:**
- **2-3 minutes:** Short enough to be low-stakes, long enough to practice structure
- **Assigned topics:** Random prompts (similar to Gabe's athletic practice model)
- **Peer feedback:** You'll both present and observe—learning happens in both roles
- Tutorial is attendance-required but NOT graded on performance—safe to make mistakes

**Example:**
- You might get a prompt like "Explain why your major is valuable in 2 minutes"
- Apply: Hook (stat or question) → Relevance → 2-3 main points → Call to action
- Peers will note: Did you hook attention? Was structure clear? Eye contact? Vocal variety?

**Cultural Note:**
- Peer feedback in Vietnamese culture can be uncomfortable (fear of losing face or causing offense)
- Guidelines will emphasize constructive, specific feedback ("I noticed..." not "You should...")

**Check Understanding:**
- "Any concerns about the tutorial activity?"
- (Address fears—emphasize safety, learning over performance)

**Transition:**
- "Next week we build on this foundation with visual communication..."

## Slide 24: Next Week Preview - Visual Communication & Slide Design

## Week 6: Enhancing Message Clarity Through Visuals

**Topics:**
- Visual hierarchy principles
- Data visualization (charts, graphs, diagrams)
- Slide design best practices (Duarte's *Resonate*, Reynolds' *Presentation Zen*)
- Cognitive load management

**Why it matters:**
- Your Week 12 Group Presentation requires slide deck
- Visuals can clarify complex ideas or create confusion—design matters
- 65% retention with visuals vs. 10% with words alone (dual coding theory)

**Pre-reading:**
- Reynolds, G. (2012). *Presentation Zen* (Ch. 4-6) - Available on Moodle

### Speaker Notes

**Opening:**
- "Today you learned what to say and how to say it—next week you'll learn how to show it"

**Key Points:**
- **Visual communication** is not "making slides pretty"—it's strategic information design
- Next week: You'll learn to create slides that support (not distract from) your message
- By Week 7, you'll combine structure + delivery + visuals + persuasion = complete presentation toolkit

**Example:**
- Poor slide: Wall of text, tiny font, no visuals → audience reads instead of listening
- Good slide: One concept, large text, supporting image → audience focuses on you, not the screen

**Transition:**
- "Final slide—your resources for continued learning..."
