## Quick Review

**Key concepts from today's lecture:**

- **Duarte's Three-Act Structure:** Opening (establish "What Is" and the gap), Middle (oscillate between problem and solution), Conclusion (paint "New Bliss" with call to action)
- **Delivery Fundamentals:** Voice modulation (pace 130-170 wpm, pitch variation, strategic pauses) and body language (eye contact, posture, natural gestures)
- **Communication Apprehension Theory (McCroskey):** Anxiety is normal—10-20% experience significant CA. Manage through physical preparation (breathing, power pose), mental preparation (visualization, reframing), and practical preparation (rehearsal)
- **Authentic Presence:** Find your natural style, prepare deeply but release scripting, share your "why"

**What good work looks like:**

- **Confident delivery:** Voice projects clearly, varied pace and pitch, strategic pauses for emphasis
- **Engaging presence:** Eye contact with audience, open posture, natural gestures
- **Clear structure:** Audience immediately understands the problem, solution, and why it matters
- **Professional composure:** Manages nervousness effectively without letting it prevent communication

## Main Activity: 2-Minute Mini-Pitch (Proposal Practice)

**Assessment Connection:** This activity bridges two assessments:
- **Persuasive Proposal (Week 7):** Practice presenting your proposal idea orally before writing it
- **Group Presentation (Week 12):** Practice confident delivery and presentation anxiety management

**The Task:**

Deliver a 2-minute oral mini-pitch presenting a business proposal idea to the class. You will practice presenting the core of a persuasive proposal—the problem and your solution—using strong delivery skills to build confidence and manage anxiety.

**Deliverable:**

A 2-minute oral presentation that includes:
1. **Problem Statement** (30-45 seconds): What business problem needs solving? Why does it matter?
2. **Proposed Solution** (45-60 seconds): What's your proposed initiative? How does it address the problem?
3. **Call to Action** (30 seconds): What specific decision or next step are you requesting?

**Success Criteria:** (from Group Presentation Rubric - Delivery & Presence, 25%)

- **Confident delivery:** Voice projects clearly to back of room; speaker appears prepared and composed
- **Effective pacing:** Conversational speed (130-170 wpm); not rushed due to nervousness
- **Strong eye contact:** Engages multiple audience members; doesn't stare at notes or floor
- **Professional presence:** Open posture, natural gestures, manages visible nervousness without it preventing communication
- **Time management:** Completes pitch within 2-minute limit (tutor will time)

**Proposal Scenarios (Choose ONE):**

You may choose any scenario from the Persuasive Proposal assessment (Assessment Handbook, Section 2) or create your own proposal idea. For tutorial practice, present the core concept only:

**Simplified Options (2-minute versions):**
1. **Sustainability Initiative:** Propose reducing company plastic waste by 50% - what's the problem and your solution approach?
2. **Technology Upgrade:** Propose adopting new project management software - why is current system failing and what's your alternative?
3. **Training Investment:** Propose leadership development program - what problem does high turnover create and how does training address it?
4. **Your Own Idea:** Any business initiative you're passionate about - what problem exists and what's your proposed solution?

**Preparation Time:**

- You will have **7 minutes** to prepare after choosing your scenario
- Use provided note card for brief outline only (problem → solution → ask)
- Focus on delivery confidence, not perfection of content
- Apply anxiety management techniques from lecture (breathing, visualization, power pose before presenting)

**Presentation Format:**

- Deliver standing at front of room (practicing formal presentation setting)
- No slides or visual aids (focus is on oral delivery and managing anxiety)
- Speak to the entire class as your decision-maker audience
- Tutor will provide 30-second warning, then time out at 2 minutes

**Peer Observation:**

While others present, observe using the feedback form (provided). Focus on:

- **Delivery & Presence:** Voice projection, pacing, eye contact, body language, confidence
- **Problem Clarity:** Did you immediately understand what problem they're addressing?
- **Solution Clarity:** Did you understand their proposed solution?
- **One strength to reinforce:** What delivery technique worked particularly well?
- **One technique to practice:** What delivery element could they focus on next time?

**Class Feedback:**

After presentations, 4-6 students will receive verbal peer feedback focusing on:
- **Delivery confidence:** How did they manage nervousness? What techniques were visible?
- **Voice and pacing:** Was pace conversational? Did pauses enhance or indicate anxiety?
- **Presence:** Did eye contact and posture convey professionalism and confidence?

**Why This Matters for Your Assessments:**

- **For Persuasive Proposal (Week 7):** Presenting your idea orally first helps clarify your thinking before writing. You'll discover which aspects of your problem/solution are compelling and which need more development.
- **For Group Presentation (Week 12):** Managing anxiety in a 2-minute pitch builds confidence for the 15-minute presentation. Every practice session reduces Communication Apprehension through exposure and skill-building.

**Participation Warning:**

You must deliver a complete 2-minute mini-pitch to receive full participation marks. Coming unprepared or declining to present when called will affect your participation grade (10% of course grade). This is a safe learning environment—nervousness is expected, mistakes are learning opportunities.
