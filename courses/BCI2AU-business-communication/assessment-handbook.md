## Tips for Success

### For Written Assessments

1. **Start with your conclusion** - Apply the Pyramid Principle to every document; busy executives read the first paragraph
2. **Know your audience** - Before writing, ask "What does my reader need to know, feel, and do?"
3. **Revise ruthlessly** - Cut 20% of your first draft; every word should earn its place
4. **Read aloud** - Catches awkward phrasing and unclear sentences your eyes miss
5. **Get feedback early** - Use tutorial peer reviews to improve before final submission

### For Presentations

1. **Practice out loud** - At least 5 full run-throughs before presenting; practice with your team
2. **Time yourself** - Being 2 minutes over is unprofessional; practice to hit exactly 15 minutes
3. **Prepare for Q&A** - Anticipate 10 likely questions and prepare concise answers for each
4. **Video yourself** - Watch for distracting habits (filler words, pacing, fidgeting)
5. **Arrive early** - Technical issues happen; give yourself 15-minute buffer

### For the Quiz

1. **Review weekly** - 15 minutes after each lecture reinforces learning; don't cram
2. **Know the frameworks** - Quiz tests framework components, not just definitions
3. **Practice application** - Weekly tutorial quizzes use same format as the comprehensive quiz
4. **Make connections** - Understand how frameworks relate (e.g., Pyramid Principle + BLUF)
5. **Use flashcards** - Create cards for each framework with name, components, and example

### General Success Strategies

1. **Attend every class** - Tutorial activities cannot be made up; in-class practice is essential
2. **Start assessments early** - Leave 1 week for revision and improvement
3. **Visit office hours** - Get feedback on drafts before submission
4. **Apply concepts immediately** - Use course frameworks in your other classes and work
5. **Form study groups** - Peer explanation strengthens understanding
