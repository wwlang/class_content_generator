## Questions

### Q1: Kolb's Learning Cycle Stages
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, what are the four stages of learning?

A) Experience, Reflection, Analysis, Application
B) Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, Active Experimentation
C) Doing, Thinking, Learning, Practicing
D) Observation, Hypothesis, Testing, Conclusion

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While these terms are similar to Kolb's model, they are not the exact terminology. Kolb uses specific terms: Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation.
- **B) Correct!** Kolb's four stages are: Concrete Experience (doing), Reflective Observation (reviewing), Abstract Conceptualization (concluding), and Active Experimentation (planning/testing).
- **C) Incorrect.** These are simplified descriptions but not Kolb's formal terminology. The model requires specific stages with distinct characteristics.
- **D) Incorrect.** This sounds like the scientific method, not Kolb's experiential learning cycle. Kolb focuses on transforming experience into knowledge through reflection and conceptualization.

### Q2: Learning Style Preferences
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

Which learning style (according to Kolb) is characterized by being action-oriented and hands-on, excelling at getting things done and adapting to circumstances?

A) Diverging
B) Assimilating
C) Converging
D) Accommodating

**Answer:** D

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Diverging learners are imaginative and feeling-oriented, excelling at viewing situations from multiple perspectives and brainstorming, not action-oriented execution.
- **B) Incorrect.** Assimilating learners are logical and idea-focused, excelling at understanding information and creating models, but may lack practical application.
- **C) Incorrect.** Converging learners are problem-solving oriented and excel at finding practical uses for theories, but this style is more about applying theory than hands-on action.
- **D) Correct!** Accommodating learners favor Concrete Experience and Active Experimentation—they are action-oriented, hands-on, excel at getting things done and adapting quickly. Their weakness may be skipping planning and reflection.

### Q3: Schön's Reflection-in-Action
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

What is the primary difference between Schön's "reflection-in-action" and "reflection-on-action"?

A) Reflection-in-action happens during the activity; reflection-on-action happens after the activity
B) Reflection-in-action is for beginners; reflection-on-action is for experts
C) Reflection-in-action is emotional; reflection-on-action is rational
D) Reflection-in-action uses frameworks; reflection-on-action does not

**Answer:** A

**Feedback:**
- **A) Correct!** Reflection-in-action is real-time thinking and adjusting while performing (e.g., noticing audience confusion during presentation and adding an example). Reflection-on-action is retrospective analysis after the event (e.g., reviewing what worked after the presentation ends).
- **B) Incorrect.** Both types of reflection are used by both beginners and experts. In fact, experts are typically BETTER at reflection-in-action because they've developed tacit knowledge through experience.
- **C) Incorrect.** Both types involve rational and emotional elements. The distinction is timing (during vs. after), not emotional vs. rational processing.
- **D) Incorrect.** Both types can use frameworks for analysis. The difference is whether you're reflecting while acting (in-action) or after acting (on-action).

### Q4: Problem Setting vs Problem Solving
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Schön, effective professionals focus on problem setting (framing the right question) as much as problem solving (finding the right answer).

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Schön emphasized that professionals don't just solve given problems—they construct problems from ambiguous situations. Problem setting (framing what the challenge actually is) determines whether you're solving the right problem.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. Schön argued that problem setting is critical for professional expertise. Novices accept problems as given; experts strategically frame problems from uncertain situations before solving them.

### Q5: MIT Sloan Learning Strategies
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to the MIT Sloan research cited in the lecture, which is NOT one of the four strategies for developing learning agility?

A) Link purpose to learning
B) Create learning-rich experiences
C) Avoid difficult challenges until mastery
D) Nurture a learning team

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect answer choice.** This IS one of the four strategies—connecting skill development to career aspirations to increase motivation.
- **B) Incorrect answer choice.** This IS one of the four strategies—deliberately seeking varied and challenging communication tasks to push beyond comfort zones.
- **C) Correct!** The MIT Sloan research advocates SEEKING difficult challenges (Strategy 2: Create learning-rich experiences), not avoiding them. The four strategies are: link purpose to learning, create learning-rich experiences, ask meta-learning questions, and nurture a learning team.
- **D) Incorrect answer choice.** This IS one of the four strategies—seeking feedback partners and embedding learning discussions into daily work.

### Q6: McKinsey Versatility Framework
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

In the McKinsey versatility framework, what does "Go Deep (Constant Curiosity)" mean?

A) Focus exclusively on one communication style and perfect it
B) Master intricacies beyond surface-level understanding while balancing knowledge with execution
C) Always ask questions during presentations to show engagement
D) Spend more time studying theory than practicing application

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** "Go Deep" doesn't mean narrow specialization—it means mastering fundamentals thoroughly. McKinsey's framework balances depth (Dimension 2) with diverse experiences (Dimension 1).
- **B) Correct!** "Go Deep" means developing deep expertise in core frameworks—understanding not just what they are but how and why they work. It's balanced with confidence to execute, not just theoretical knowledge. John Plant's quote: understand "not just what a product does but how and why."
- **C) Incorrect.** While curiosity involves asking questions, "Go Deep" specifically refers to mastering intricacies of core competencies, not audience engagement behaviors during presentations.
- **D) Incorrect.** The framework emphasizes balancing knowledge acquisition with decisive action—not prioritizing theory over practice. Going deep means thorough mastery applied in practice.

### Q8: Knowing-in-Action
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Schön, "knowing-in-action" refers to tacit knowledge embedded in skillful performance—things you've learned so well they become automatic.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Schön described knowing-in-action as the tacit, automatic knowledge that develops through experience and reflection. It's "what you know but can't fully articulate"—skills that have become second nature through practice.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. Schön's concept of knowing-in-action specifically describes this phenomenon of tacit, automatic expertise. For example, experienced communicators apply Pyramid Principle automatically without conscious thought—that's knowing-in-action.

### Q9: Framework Integration Levels
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to the lecture, what distinguishes "Level 3: Strategic Integration (Excellent)" from "Level 2: Multiple Application (Good)"?

A) Using more frameworks in the same presentation
B) Showing how frameworks inform each other with clear strategic reasoning
C) Applying frameworks perfectly without any errors
D) Memorizing all framework definitions verbatim

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Number of frameworks doesn't determine integration level. Level 3 is about HOW frameworks connect, not HOW MANY you use. You could use two frameworks with strategic integration or five frameworks without integration.
- **B) Correct!** Level 3 demonstrates strategic integration where frameworks inform each other: "We analyzed stakeholders and discovered X, which led us to choose Y approach, which shaped how we applied Z framework." This shows frameworks connect strategically, not just coexist.
- **C) Incorrect.** Integration is about strategic reasoning and connections between frameworks, not flawless execution. You could apply frameworks correctly (Level 2) without showing strategic integration.
- **D) Incorrect.** Integration is about application and strategic reasoning, not memorization. You demonstrate integration by showing WHY you chose frameworks and how they connect, not by reciting definitions.

A) Strategic Foundation
B) Content Design
C) Delivery & Visuals
D) Integration & Meta-Awareness

**Answer:** D

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Strategic Foundation includes audience analysis, communication objectives, and cultural considerations—the planning before design, not the meta-awareness of choices.
- **B) Incorrect.** Content Design includes structure (Pyramid Principle), persuasive elements, and evidence—the "what" of your message, not the "why" behind framework choices.
- **C) Incorrect.** Delivery & Visuals includes slide design, executive presence, and team coordination—the "how" of delivery, not strategic reasoning about framework selection.
- **D) Correct!** Integration & Meta-Awareness is the category that includes "Framework choices explained with strategic reasoning," "Connections between frameworks made explicit," and "Self-awareness of communication decisions demonstrated."
