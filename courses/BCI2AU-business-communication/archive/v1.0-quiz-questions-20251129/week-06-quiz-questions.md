## Questions

### Q1: Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (2009), how many chunks of information can each processing channel (visual or auditory) handle simultaneously?

A) 3-5 chunks
B) 5-7 chunks
C) 7-9 chunks
D) 9-11 chunks

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While this is within the limited capacity range, it underestimates the research findings. Mayer's theory specifies 5-7 chunks as the limit for each channel.
- **B) Correct!** Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning identifies limited capacity as one of three core assumptions, stating each channel (visual and auditory) handles only 5-7 chunks simultaneously.
- **C) Incorrect.** This exceeds the capacity limit identified by cognitive load research. The brain's working memory is more limited than this range suggests.
- **D) Incorrect.** This significantly overestimates cognitive capacity. Research consistently shows much more limited working memory capacity than this range.

### Q2: Types of Cognitive Load
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

A presenter uses rotating text animations and decorative clip art on their slides. According to cognitive load theory, what type of cognitive load does this create?

A) Intrinsic load
B) Extraneous load
C) Germane load
D) Essential load

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Intrinsic load refers to the inherent complexity of the material itself (e.g., calculus is more complex than addition). Decorative elements don't relate to content complexity.
- **B) Correct!** Extraneous load is wasted brain power caused by poor design choices like decorative clip art and unnecessary animations. These elements distract from the actual message without supporting understanding.
- **C) Incorrect.** Germane load is productive cognitive effort that helps build understanding and mental models. Decorative animations work against this goal rather than supporting it.
- **D) Incorrect.** "Essential load" is not one of the three types of cognitive load identified in the theory. The three types are intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

### Q3: Mayer's Coherence Principle
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

What is the effect size (d value) for Mayer's coherence principle, which states you should exclude extraneous material from slides?

A) d = 0.50
B) d = 0.60
C) d = 0.70
D) d = 0.87

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This underestimates the strength of the coherence effect. Research shows a larger effect size for removing extraneous material.
- **B) Incorrect.** While closer, this still underestimates the effect. The coherence principle has a stronger impact on learning than this value suggests.
- **C) Correct!** Mayer's coherence principle has an effect size of d = 0.70, which is considered a large effect. This means removing extraneous material like decorative clip art significantly improves learning.
- **D) Incorrect.** This is the effect size for the redundancy principle, not the coherence principle. The redundancy principle (don't read on-screen text aloud) has an even stronger effect.

### Q4: Redundancy Principle
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Mayer's redundancy principle, when you read text aloud that also appears on the slide, the audience can efficiently process both the visual and auditory information simultaneously.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** This is incorrect. The redundancy principle (d = 0.87) shows that reading on-screen text aloud actually overloads the visual channel. The audience must choose to either READ or LISTEN, not both. When the same words appear visually and aurally, the brain cannot sync them efficiently, reducing comprehension.
- **If answered False:** Correct! When text is both displayed and read aloud, the visual channel becomes overloaded. Research shows audiences can either read OR listen, not both effectively. Slides should contain short cues (keywords/phrases) while the presenter provides full verbal explanations.

### Q5: Tufte's Data-Ink Ratio
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Edward Tufte (2001), what is the formula for the data-ink ratio?

A) Total ink ÷ Data-ink
B) Data-ink ÷ Total ink used to print the graphic
C) (Data-ink − Non-data-ink) ÷ Total ink
D) Total graphic area ÷ Data area

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This reverses the formula. The data-ink ratio measures what proportion of total ink represents actual data, not the inverse.
- **B) Correct!** Tufte's data-ink ratio formula is: Data-ink ÷ Total ink used to print the graphic. This measures what percentage of visual elements actually convey information versus decoration.
- **C) Incorrect.** While this considers both data and non-data elements, it's not the correct formula. Tufte's approach is a simple ratio of data ink to total ink.
- **D) Incorrect.** The data-ink ratio focuses on ink usage (visual elements), not spatial area. Area calculations are relevant for other visualization principles but not this specific ratio.

### Q6: Chartjunk Categories
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Tufte (2001), what does the term "Ducks" refer to in the context of chartjunk?

A) Moiré vibration patterns creating optical interference
B) Heavy gridlines dominating the chart area
C) Self-promoting graphics where decorative forms overtake data
D) Redundant legends and unnecessary labels

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This describes the first category of chartjunk (moiré vibration), not "ducks." Dense patterns that create visual shimmer fall under this different category.
- **B) Incorrect.** This describes heavy grids, another category of chartjunk. "Ducks" specifically refers to decorative graphic forms, not gridline problems.
- **C) Correct!** "Ducks" is Tufte's metaphorical term (from architecture) for self-promoting graphics where decorative forms overtake data—like 3D pie charts or bars shaped like money bags. The decoration becomes more prominent than the information.
- **D) Incorrect.** While these are elements to eliminate according to Tufte's principles, they don't fall under the specific "ducks" category of chartjunk.

### Q7: Graphical Integrity
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

A chart shows revenue growth from $100M to $120M (20% increase), but uses a bar that is 3x taller for the $120M value compared to the baseline. What is the lie factor?

A) 1.0
B) 1.5
C) 2.0
D) 2.5

**Answer:** D

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** A lie factor of 1.0 would indicate accurate representation. In this case, the visual effect (3x height) does not match the data effect (1.2x increase), so the lie factor exceeds 1.0.
- **B) Incorrect.** While this recognizes the lie factor is above 1.0, it underestimates the degree of visual exaggeration compared to the actual data change.
- **C) Incorrect.** This calculation doesn't properly account for the relationship between the visual effect (3x) and the data effect (1.2x increase from 100 to 120).
- **D) Correct!** Lie Factor = Size of effect shown in graphic ÷ Size of effect in data. The graphic shows 3x height, but the data only increased 1.2x (from 100 to 120). Therefore: 3 ÷ 1.2 = 2.5. The graphic overstates the effect by 2.5 times.

### Q8: Declutter + Focus Model
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Kellogg research (2021), decluttering slides alone (without adding focusing elements) provides significant cognitive benefits and improves audience comprehension of the main conclusion.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** This is incorrect. The Kellogg study found that decluttering only improves appearance but provides NO cognitive benefit. Only when decluttering is combined with focusing elements (headlines, strategic color highlighting) does comprehension improve—by approximately 2.5x.
- **If answered False:** Correct! Kellogg research revealed an unexpected finding: decluttered graphs looked better but didn't improve comprehension compared to cluttered versions. Active guidance through focusing elements (headlines stating conclusions, color highlighting key data) was required to achieve the ~2.5x improvement in capturing the main conclusion.

### Q9: The Focus Technique
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

When applying the focus technique to a multi-colored bar chart, what is the recommended maximum number of colors to use according to Kellogg research?

A) 1-2 colors
B) 3-4 colors
C) 5-6 colors
D) As many colors as data series

**Answer:** A

**Feedback:**
- **A) Correct!** The focus technique recommends limiting colors to a maximum of 1-2 colors. Typically, one data series is highlighted in color (the important one) while others appear in gray. This directs the eye naturally to what matters without creating visual noise.
- **B) Incorrect.** Using 3-4 colors creates too much visual noise and increases extraneous cognitive load. The research found that restraint in color usage works better than variety.
- **C) Incorrect.** This many colors would create significant visual distraction, making it difficult for audiences to identify what's important. More colors equal more extraneous cognitive load.
- **D) Incorrect.** While this might seem logical for distinguishing data series, it violates the focus principle. Most data should be de-emphasized (grayed out) so attention goes to the key series being highlighted.

### Q10: Strategic Tool Selection Framework
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to the MIT Sloan 2×2 matrix (Kesari, 2024), what is the best tool for explanatory communication with sophisticated information levels?

A) AI chat interfaces
B) AI-infused BI tools
C) Interactive dashboards
D) Data stories / Presentation decks

**Answer:** D

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** AI chat interfaces are best suited for exploratory tasks with simple information levels, such as asking "What was our sales number last month?" They cannot synthesize multi-source strategic narratives.
- **B) Incorrect.** AI-infused BI (Business Intelligence) tools are recommended for explanatory communication with simple information, not sophisticated multi-faceted contexts requiring strategic synthesis.
- **C) Incorrect.** Interactive dashboards are best for exploratory tasks with sophisticated information—they allow audiences to discover insights themselves rather than being guided to a specific conclusion.
- **D) Correct!** The MIT Sloan framework identifies data stories and presentation decks as the best tool when you need to provide explanatory communication (guiding to conclusions) with sophisticated information (multi-faceted with context). High-stakes persuasion requires human-crafted visual storytelling.
