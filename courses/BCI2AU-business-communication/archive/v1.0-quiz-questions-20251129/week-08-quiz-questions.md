## Questions

### Q1: Executive Presence Model Elements
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Hewlett's Executive Presence Model (2024), what are the three elements of executive presence?

A) Confidence, Communication, Credibility
B) Gravitas, Communication, Appearance
C) Decisiveness, Virtual Presence, Authenticity
D) Leadership, Speaking Skills, Professional Image

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While confidence is part of gravitas and credibility matters, these aren't the three formal elements. Hewlett's model uses gravitas, communication, and appearance.
- **B) Correct!** Hewlett's updated Executive Presence Model (2024) identifies three elements: Gravitas (67% most important—confidence and decisiveness under pressure), Communication (virtual presence and listening), and Appearance (authenticity over formality).
- **C) Incorrect.** These are components WITHIN the three elements (decisiveness is part of gravitas, virtual presence is part of communication, authenticity is part of appearance), but not the three elements themselves.
- **D) Incorrect.** While these relate to executive presence, Hewlett's specific model uses gravitas, communication, and appearance as the three core elements.

### Q2: Gravitas Priority
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Hewlett (2024), what percentage of senior executives identify gravitas as the most important element of executive presence?

A) 50%
B) 67%
C) 70%
D) 85%

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** 50% is too low. Hewlett's research found that 67% of senior executives prioritize gravitas above communication and appearance.
- **B) Correct!** 67% of senior executives say gravitas—confidence and decisiveness under pressure combined with inclusiveness—is what really matters in executive presence.
- **C) Incorrect.** 70% is the statistic from the hook (percentage of leaders who consider decisiveness a component of executive presence), not the percentage who prioritize gravitas overall.
- **D) Incorrect.** While gravitas is clearly the top priority, the specific percentage from Hewlett's research is 67%, not 85%.

### Q3: SCCT Crisis Clusters
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to SCCT, what are the three crisis clusters based on responsibility attribution?

A) Minor, Moderate, Major
B) Internal, External, Mixed
C) Victim, Accidental, Intentional/Preventable
D) Technical, Human, Natural

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** SCCT doesn't categorize crises by severity levels. The three clusters are victim (low responsibility), accidental (moderate), and intentional/preventable (high).
- **B) Incorrect.** While SCCT considers internal vs. external attribution, these aren't the cluster names. The three clusters are victim, accidental, and intentional/preventable.
- **C) Correct!** SCCT categorizes all crises into three clusters based on stakeholder attribution of responsibility: Victim (low—external attribution like natural disasters), Accidental (moderate—mixed attribution like technical errors), and Intentional/Preventable (high—internal attribution like human-error accidents or misconduct).
- **D) Incorrect.** SCCT doesn't use these categories. The three clusters focus on responsibility level: victim, accidental, and intentional/preventable.

### Q4: The Four W's Narrative Structure
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In the EDGE Framework's "Four W's" narrative structure for CEO communications, what are the four W's?

A) Who, What, Where, When
B) Who you are, Why you are here, What you will achieve, When you will execute
C) Who to contact, What went wrong, Where it happened, When to respond
D) Who is responsible, What is the solution, Why it matters, When it begins

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** These are the traditional journalism questions, not the Four W's from the EDGE Framework for executive communications.
- **B) Correct!** The Four W's create a CEO narrative: (1) Who you are (identity/values), (2) Why you are here (purpose/mission), (3) What you will achieve (agenda with accountability), (4) When you will execute (timeline and immediate actions).
- **C) Incorrect.** This sounds like crisis response questions, not the Four W's narrative structure for executive communications.
- **D) Incorrect.** While these questions might be relevant in some contexts, the specific Four W's from the EDGE Framework are: who you are, why you are here, what you will achieve, when you will execute.

### Q5: Four-Step Q&A Framework
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

What is the correct sequence of the Four-Step Q&A Framework for handling challenging questions?

A) Answer → Clarify → Acknowledge → Check
B) Clarify → Acknowledge → Answer → Check
C) Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check
D) Acknowledge → Answer → Clarify → Check

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Starting with the answer is too abrupt and doesn't show respect. The correct sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check.
- **B) Incorrect.** You need to acknowledge the question first before clarifying. The correct sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check.
- **C) Correct!** The Four-Step Q&A Framework follows this sequence: (1) Acknowledge the question ("That's an excellent question"), (2) Clarify if needed ("Are you asking about X or Y?"), (3) Answer directly, and (4) Check understanding ("Does that address your question?").
- **D) Incorrect.** Clarifying should come before answering to ensure you understand the question correctly. The sequence is Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check.

### Q6: Attribution Theory in SCCT
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

In SCCT, Attribution Theory suggests that stakeholders' emotional and behavioral responses to a crisis depend on whether they attribute the crisis to situational (external) or organizational (internal) factors.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Attribution Theory is the core mechanism of SCCT. When stakeholders attribute a crisis to external factors (situational), they assign less responsibility to the organization. When they attribute it to internal factors (organizational choices/actions), they assign more responsibility—and this drives how they react emotionally and behaviorally.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. This statement accurately describes how Attribution Theory works within SCCT. Stakeholder assessment of responsibility (external vs. internal attribution) determines the appropriate crisis response intensity. Organizations must match their response to the level of responsibility stakeholders perceive.

### Q7: Three Conversations Model Layers
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to the Three Conversations Model from Harvard Negotiation Project, what is the purpose of the "Identity Conversation" layer?

A) To establish credibility and professional identity with the other person
B) To address the internal dialogue about what the conflict means for who we are
C) To confirm each person's role and responsibilities in the situation
D) To define how each person wants to be perceived by others

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The Identity Conversation isn't about establishing credibility externally—it's about your internal dialogue: "Am I competent? Am I good? Am I lovable?" These self-concept questions get triggered during difficult conversations.
- **B) Correct!** The Identity Conversation addresses your internal thoughts about what the conflict means for who you are as a person. The common mistake is all-or-nothing thinking ("One mistake means I'm incompetent"). The key technique is to accept your own complexity—one situation doesn't define you.
- **C) Incorrect.** Clarifying roles and responsibilities would be part of the "What Happened" conversation (facts and interpretations), not the Identity conversation (self-concept).
- **D) Incorrect.** While reputation matters, the Identity Conversation specifically focuses on your INTERNAL dialogue about self-concept, not external perception management.

### Q8: "The And Stance" Technique
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

In the Three Conversations Model, what is the purpose of "The And Stance" technique in the "What Happened?" conversation?

A) To agree with the other person's version of events to avoid conflict
B) To acknowledge that both perspectives can be simultaneously valid rather than fighting about who's right
C) To add more evidence and facts to prove your interpretation is correct
D) To delay making a decision until more information is available

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The And Stance doesn't mean agreeing with their version or abandoning your own—it means holding space for both perspectives as potentially valid simultaneously. You're not conceding; you're recognizing complexity.
- **B) Correct!** "The And Stance" means recognizing that both perspectives can be valid at the same time: "You see it this way AND I see it this way." This moves you from debate (who's right?) to learning (what can we both understand?). The common mistake in the "What Happened" conversation is assuming certainty about facts.
- **C) Incorrect.** The And Stance isn't about gathering more evidence to win the argument—it's about accepting that facts are often disputed and both interpretations might have merit.
- **D) Incorrect.** The And Stance isn't a delay tactic—it's a reframing technique that allows you to proceed with the conversation while acknowledging multiple valid perspectives.

### Q9: Gravitas Post-Pandemic Shift
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Hewlett's updated Executive Presence Model (2024), gravitas now emphasizes demonstrated competence and inclusiveness over pedigree (which school you attended).

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! A key shift in Hewlett's updated model (comparing 2012 to 2022 data) is that pedigree is now less important than demonstrated competence. Modern gravitas emphasizes confidence under pressure combined with inclusiveness and respect for diverse perspectives—not educational credentials or which school you attended. This is a significant post-pandemic change.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. This statement accurately describes a major shift in the Executive Presence Model. The old model (pre-2012) emphasized pedigree and educational background. The updated model (2024) shows that gravitas now prioritizes demonstrated competence, decisiveness under pressure, and inclusiveness over educational credentials.

### Q10: Four-Step Q&A Framework Application
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

A student presenter is asked: "Your methodology seems flawed. How can we trust your conclusions?" Using the Four-Step Q&A Framework (Acknowledge → Clarify → Answer → Check), what would be the best "acknowledge" response?

A) "That's not a fair question—we followed standard research procedures."
B) "I'm glad you asked that because I was worried someone might misunderstand."
C) "Thank you for raising that concern—methodology rigor is crucial."
D) "Let me clarify what you mean by 'flawed' before I respond."

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This is defensive and challenges the questioner rather than acknowledging. The first step is to show respect and buy thinking time, not argue about fairness.
- **B) Incorrect.** This sounds defensive ("worried someone might misunderstand" implies the questioner is confused). Acknowledgment should validate the question, not suggest the asker is wrong.
- **C) Correct!** This response acknowledges the question respectfully ("Thank you for raising that concern"), shows you value the topic ("methodology rigor is crucial"), and buys you 2-3 seconds to think. It demonstrates executive presence: confidence without defensiveness. Using the Three Conversations Model principle of separating intent from impact, you assume they're testing your rigor, not attacking you personally.
- **D) Incorrect.** This is the SECOND step (Clarify), not the first (Acknowledge). While clarification is important, you should acknowledge first to show respect and reduce tension before asking for clarification.
