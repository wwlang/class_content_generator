## Questions

### Q1: Duarte's Three-Act Structure
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Nancy Duarte's presentation framework, what are the three acts of a presentation structure?

A) Introduction, Body, Conclusion
B) Beginning (What Is), Middle (Contrast), End (New Bliss)
C) Hook, Evidence, Call to Action
D) Problem, Solution, Implementation

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While this is a traditional structure, Duarte's framework uses different terminology: "What Is" (current state), oscillating contrast in the middle, and "New Bliss" (transformed future).
- **B) Correct!** Duarte's three-act structure starts with "What Is" (beginning), uses oscillating contrast between problem and solution (middle), and ends with "New Bliss" (the transformed future state).
- **C) Incorrect.** These are elements within presentations but not Duarte's three-act structure. Hook is part of Act 1, Call to Action is part of Act 3.
- **D) Incorrect.** Problem and solution are part of the oscillating pattern in Act 2 (the middle), not the three acts themselves.

### Q2: Four Opening Elements
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

Which of the following is NOT one of the four elements of a strong opening according to the lecture?

A) Hook
B) Credibility
C) Summary of conclusions
D) Roadmap

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect answer choice.** Hook IS one of the four elements—it grabs attention with a statistic, question, story, or bold claim.
- **B) Incorrect answer choice.** Credibility IS one of the four elements—establishing why you're qualified to speak on the topic.
- **C) Correct!** The four elements are Hook, Relevance, Credibility, and Roadmap. Summary comes at the END, not the opening. Starting with conclusions kills engagement.
- **D) Incorrect answer choice.** Roadmap IS one of the four elements—previewing where the presentation is going to reduce audience anxiety.

### Q3: Sparkline Pattern Purpose
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

What is the primary purpose of Duarte's "Sparkline" pattern (oscillating between "What Is" and "What Could Be") in the middle section of a presentation?

A) To confuse the audience so they pay closer attention
B) To create emotional tension through contrast that maintains attention
C) To fill time by repeating the same points multiple ways
D) To demonstrate both sides of every argument equally

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The Sparkline doesn't confuse—it creates clear contrast. Confusion reduces engagement, while contrast increases it.
- **B) Correct!** The oscillation between current problems ("What Is") and future possibilities ("What Could Be") creates emotional tension that keeps the audience engaged. Each trough-to-peak cycle maintains attention.
- **C) Incorrect.** The oscillation isn't repetition—each cycle presents a new problem-solution pair. Duarte recommends 3-5 distinct main points, not filling time.
- **D) Incorrect.** The Sparkline isn't about balanced argumentation—it's about showing contrast between current state (problem) and desired future (solution) to create engagement.

### Q4: S.T.A.R. Moment Definition
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In presentation closings, what does S.T.A.R. stand for?

A) Synthesize, Transform, Act, Recap
B) Something They'll Always Remember
C) Strategic Takeaway And Recommendation
D) Strong Transition And Resolution

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While synthesize and act are elements of a strong closing, S.T.A.R. itself stands for a single concept: Something They'll Always Remember.
- **B) Correct!** S.T.A.R. stands for "Something They'll Always Remember"—a memorable element like a demo, prop, powerful story, or shocking statistic that makes your closing unforgettable.
- **C) Incorrect.** This sounds plausible but isn't the correct acronym. S.T.A.R. is about creating a memorable moment, not strategic takeaways.
- **D) Incorrect.** S.T.A.R. isn't about transitions—it's about creating one unforgettable moment that audiences will remember long after the presentation ends.

### Q5: McCroskey's CA Definition
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to McCroskey (1977), how is Communication Apprehension (CA) defined?

A) The inability to speak clearly in public settings
B) An individual's level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication
C) A personality disorder requiring clinical treatment
D) The physical symptoms of nervousness during presentations

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** CA is about emotional response (fear/anxiety), not physical ability to speak. Someone can have perfect articulation but still experience high CA.
- **B) Correct!** McCroskey's definition focuses on the fear or anxiety about communication, whether the communication is happening now (real) or will happen later (anticipated).
- **C) Incorrect.** McCroskey defined CA as a normal individual difference, not a disorder. 10-20% of people experience significant CA—it's common, not pathological.
- **D) Incorrect.** While CA can cause physical symptoms (sweating, rapid heartbeat), McCroskey's definition focuses on the emotional state (fear/anxiety), not the symptoms themselves.

### Q6: Trait CA vs State CA
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

Trait CA refers to consistent anxiety across all communication situations, while State CA refers to anxiety in specific, high-stakes situations.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Trait CA is an enduring characteristic—someone feels nervous in ANY communication setting. State CA is situational—someone might be calm in meetings but anxious before presentations.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. This statement accurately describes the distinction. Trait CA is consistent across contexts (part of temperament), while State CA is triggered by specific high-stakes situations.

### Q7: 4-7-8 Breathing Technique
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In the Anxiety Management Plan (AMP), what does the 4-7-8 breathing technique refer to?

A) Breathe in for 4 seconds, out for 7, hold for 8
B) Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8
C) Repeat the sequence 4 times, wait 7 seconds, repeat 8 times
D) 4 deep breaths, 7 normal breaths, 8 shallow breaths

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The order is wrong—you hold BETWEEN inhale and exhale, not after exhaling. The correct sequence is inhale-hold-exhale.
- **B) Correct!** The 4-7-8 technique is: Inhale through nose for 4 counts, hold for 7 counts, exhale for 8 counts. This lowers heart rate and reduces physiological symptoms of anxiety.
- **C) Incorrect.** These numbers refer to the duration of each breath phase (inhale-hold-exhale), not the number of repetitions or timing between cycles.
- **D) Incorrect.** The 4-7-8 refers to counts for a single breath cycle (in-hold-out), not different types of breathing or number of breaths.

### Q8: Reframing Anxiety as Excitement
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to research cited in the lecture, anxiety and excitement create different physiological responses in the body.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Incorrect. Alison Wood Brooks' research from Harvard Business School shows that anxiety and excitement create IDENTICAL physiological responses (increased heart rate, adrenaline). The difference is cognitive interpretation, not bodily response.
- **If answered False:** Correct! Anxiety and excitement create the same physiological state. The lecture cited Alison Wood Brooks' research showing that reframing "I'm anxious" as "I'm excited" works because you're changing interpretation, not fighting your body's response.

### Q9: Grounding Techniques Purpose
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

In Matt Abrahams' in-the-moment anxiety management techniques, what is the purpose of "grounding techniques" like touching an anchor object or focusing on one friendly face?

A) To distract yourself from the presentation content
B) To make the audience think you're more confident than you are
C) To interrupt anxiety spirals through physical sensations and external focus
D) To give yourself time to remember what to say next

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Grounding doesn't distract from content—it helps you stay present while delivering content. The goal is to reduce mental spiraling, not avoid thinking about your material.
- **B) Incorrect.** Grounding is for YOUR benefit (reducing anxiety), not for audience perception. These techniques are often invisible to the audience.
- **C) Correct!** Grounding techniques use physical sensations (touching object) and external focus (friendly face) to interrupt the internal anxiety spiral. Research from mindfulness therapy shows physical anchors help regulate emotions.
- **D) Incorrect.** While pausing can help memory, grounding techniques specifically target anxiety reduction by shifting attention from internal worry to external/physical anchors.

### Q10: Authentic Communication Definition
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to Alisa Brodsky's research (UT Austin McCombs, 2022), what does authentic communication mean?

A) Behaving identically across all communication contexts
B) Always saying exactly what you think without filtering
C) Genuine intent adapted to situation—what feels authentic varies by channel and audience
D) Never adjusting your communication style for cultural norms

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Brodsky's research challenges the idea that authenticity means identical behavior everywhere. Authentic communication is contextual—you adapt while maintaining genuine intent.
- **B) Incorrect.** Authenticity doesn't mean unfiltered thoughts. You can be authentic while choosing appropriate language and tone for the situation and audience.
- **C) Correct!** Brodsky found that authentic communication is contextual—what feels authentic varies by channel and audience. You can adapt your style (e.g., formal for professors) while maintaining genuine intent. This isn't "fake," it's contextual adaptation.
- **D) Incorrect.** Brodsky's research shows you CAN adapt to cultural norms while remaining authentic. For example, showing respect through tone (Vietnamese cultural norm) while delivering authentic content isn't inauthentic.
