## Questions

### Q1: Freeman's Stakeholder Definition
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to R. Edward Freeman (1984), what is a stakeholder?

A) Any individual or group who owns shares in the organization
B) Any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives
C) Only internal members of the organization such as employees and management
D) External parties who have contractual agreements with the organization

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This describes shareholders only. Freeman's definition is much broader than ownership—it includes anyone who affects or is affected by the organization.
- **B) Correct!** Freeman's 1984 definition includes the bidirectional relationship: stakeholders "can AFFECT" the organization OR "are AFFECTED BY" it. This expands responsibility beyond just shareholders to include employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and more.
- **C) Incorrect.** Freeman's framework includes both internal AND external stakeholders. Customers, suppliers, communities, governments, and media are all stakeholders despite being external.
- **D) Incorrect.** While contractual parties are stakeholders, Freeman's definition is broader—it includes groups without contracts, like communities affected by pollution or competitors who affect strategy.

### Q2: Freeman's Stakeholder Categories
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

Which of the following is NOT one of Freeman's 11 stakeholder categories from his original 1984 hub-and-spoke model?

A) Competitors
B) Trade associations
C) Social media influencers
D) Media

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect answer choice.** Competitors ARE one of Freeman's stakeholder categories—they affect your strategic decisions and competitive positioning.
- **B) Incorrect answer choice.** Trade associations ARE one of Freeman's 11 original categories—they represent industry interests and influence regulatory environments.
- **C) Correct!** Social media influencers were not part of Freeman's 1984 framework because social media didn't exist then. The lecture notes that modern organizations might add this category today, but it's not part of Freeman's original 11.
- **D) Incorrect answer choice.** Media IS one of Freeman's stakeholder categories—media shapes public perception and can significantly affect organizational reputation.

### Q3: Mitchell's Three Attributes
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

What are the three attributes in Mitchell's Stakeholder Salience Model (1997) that determine stakeholder prioritization?

A) Importance, Influence, and Interest
B) Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency
C) Authority, Credibility, and Timeliness
D) Impact, Rights, and Criticality

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** While these sound plausible, Mitchell's model specifically uses Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency as the three measurable attributes.
- **B) Correct!** Mitchell's framework uses Power (extent stakeholder can impose their will), Legitimacy (socially accepted and expected claim), and Urgency (time sensitivity and criticality). Stakeholder salience is determined by how many of these three attributes are present.
- **C) Incorrect.** These are not Mitchell's terms. The model specifically identifies Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency as the defining attributes of stakeholder salience.
- **D) Incorrect.** While these terms relate to stakeholder characteristics, Mitchell's model specifically uses Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency as the three key attributes.

### Q4: Mitchell's Definitive Stakeholders
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In Mitchell's Stakeholder Salience Model, what are "definitive" stakeholders?

A) Stakeholders who have only power
B) Stakeholders who have power and legitimacy
C) Stakeholders who have power, legitimacy, and urgency
D) Stakeholders who have legitimacy and urgency but not power

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Stakeholders with only power are classified as "dormant" in Mitchell's model—they have low salience because they lack legitimacy and urgency.
- **B) Incorrect.** Stakeholders with power and legitimacy are classified as "dominant"—they are important but not at the highest priority level without urgency.
- **C) Correct!** Definitive stakeholders possess all three attributes (power, legitimacy, and urgency), making them the highest priority. Example: health regulators enforcing a safety deadline have authority, valid claims, and time pressure—they demand immediate attention.
- **D) Incorrect.** Stakeholders with legitimacy and urgency but not power are classified as "dependent"—they have important claims but limited ability to force organizational action.

### Q5: McKinsey EDGE Framework
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In McKinsey's EDGE framework for stakeholder engagement (2024), what does the "D" stand for?

A) Decisive
B) Dynamic
C) Distinctive
D) Deliberate

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** "Decisive" isn't part of McKinsey's EDGE acronym. The framework focuses on communication approach, not decision speed.
- **B) Incorrect.** While stakeholder engagement is dynamic, the "D" in EDGE stands for Distinctive—becoming the storyteller-in-chief with a singular, compelling narrative.
- **C) Correct!** EDGE = Expanded (embrace external role as bridge), Distinctive (singular storyteller-in-chief), Growth-oriented (empower team ambassadors), Engaged (consistent communication drumbeat). The "D" emphasizes developing one compelling narrative adapted for each stakeholder.
- **D) Incorrect.** "Deliberate" isn't part of EDGE. The "D" stands for Distinctive—creating a unique, compelling narrative that makes you an effective communicator.

### Q6: Dynamic Stakeholder Salience
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Mitchell's model, stakeholder salience is static—once you classify a stakeholder type, it remains constant over time.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Incorrect. Mitchell explicitly states that stakeholder salience is dynamic and perception-based. Stakeholders can gain or lose attributes over time based on context changes.
- **If answered False:** Correct! Stakeholder salience changes dynamically. Examples from the lecture: employees who unionize move from "dependent" to "definitive" by gaining power; former customers who become activists on social media move from "dormant" to "dangerous" by adding urgency. COVID-19 suddenly made employees definitive stakeholders due to health urgency and labor shortage.

### Q7: Purpose of Stakeholder Salience
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

Why is Mitchell's concept of stakeholder salience important for managers?

A) It helps managers avoid dealing with difficult stakeholders
B) It provides a systematic way to allocate limited attention and resources among competing stakeholder claims
C) It eliminates the need to consider all stakeholders equally
D) It ensures that only powerful stakeholders receive attention

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The purpose is not to avoid stakeholders but to prioritize them strategically. Even low-salience stakeholders should be monitored because their status can change.
- **B) Correct!** Managers face limited time, money, and attention with multiple competing stakeholder claims. Mitchell's salience model provides a systematic algorithm for prioritization based on power, legitimacy, and urgency—making Freeman's stakeholder management actionable rather than aspirational.
- **C) Incorrect.** While the model does help prioritize (rather than treating all equally), this misses the key purpose: strategic resource allocation when you cannot address everyone at once.
- **D) Incorrect.** This is both inaccurate and unethical. Definitive stakeholders have all three attributes (including legitimacy and urgency), not just power. Mitchell's model ensures legitimate claims receive attention even when stakeholders lack power.

### Q8: McKinsey Four W's Narrative
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

In McKinsey's Four W's narrative structure for stakeholder communication, which element addresses "your personal leadership journey and aspirations"?

A) WHO
B) WHY
C) WHAT
D) WHEN

**Answer:** A

**Feedback:**
- **A) Correct!** WHO = your personal leadership journey and aspirations (establishes personal credibility/ethos). This is adapted based on audience—investors want to hear about your track record, employees want to understand your values and vision for the team.
- **B) Incorrect.** WHY addresses the organization's reason for existence and contribution to society (purpose beyond profit), not your personal leadership journey.
- **C) Incorrect.** WHAT addresses the strategic agenda in simple, compelling terms—the organizational plan going forward, not your personal background.
- **D) Incorrect.** WHEN addresses the timing and sequencing of communication rollout (e.g., employees before media, investors before public announcement), not personal leadership.

### Q9: Duarte's Audience Calibration
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Duarte's audience calibration framework (MIT Sloan Management Review, 2024), analytical audiences such as engineers and finance professionals should receive presentations that are approximately 80% logos (data-driven) and 20% pathos (emotional).

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Duarte's research shows analytical audiences prefer data-heavy content—they engage with charts, statistics, and logical arguments. Twenty slides of data isn't boring to engineers; it's what they want. Emotion should be used sparingly and strategically (e.g., a brief success story to illustrate impact).
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. Duarte's framework from MIT Sloan Management Review (2024) specifically recommends leading with evidence for analytical audiences. While they still need SOME emotional content (every presentation needs both), the ratio should be approximately 80% logos and 20% pathos.

### Q10: Message Adaptation Application
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

In the wellness program integration example from the lecture, why do employees receive 70% pathos content while senior management receives 80% logos content?

A) Because employees are less educated and cannot understand data
B) Because management does not care about employee wellness stories
C) Because employees need to connect with personal health impact to change behavior, while management needs ROI data to approve budget
D) Because emotional content is easier to create than analytical content

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This is both inaccurate and disrespectful. The difference isn't about intelligence—it's about what each audience needs to make their specific decision. Employees are perfectly capable of understanding data; they simply need different information to decide whether to participate.
- **B) Incorrect.** Management may care about wellness stories, but their PRIMARY decision criterion is financial. Budget approval requires ROI justification. The content mix reflects decision-making needs, not level of care.
- **C) Correct!** This demonstrates strategic message adaptation: employees are being asked to change personal behavior (participate in wellness activities), so they need emotional connection to health benefits—stories and testimonials persuade behavior change. Management holds budget authority and must justify costs—they need cost-benefit analysis and ROI. Same program, different decision contexts, different calibration.
- **D) Incorrect.** The choice of logos/pathos ratio isn't about ease of creation—it's about audience needs and decision-making context. Creating compelling emotional content can be just as difficult as analytical content.
