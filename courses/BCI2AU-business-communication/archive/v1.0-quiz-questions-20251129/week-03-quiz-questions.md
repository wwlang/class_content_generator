## Questions

### Q1: Pyramid Principle Definition
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Bloom's Level:** Remembering

According to the Pyramid Principle, what should appear FIRST in a business document?

A) Supporting data and evidence
B) Background information and context
C) The main recommendation or conclusion
D) The analysis process you followed

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Supporting data appears at the bottom of the pyramid (third level), not at the top. The Pyramid Principle requires leading with conclusions.
- **B) Incorrect.** While background appears in the SCQA opening, the Pyramid Principle structure itself starts with the governing thought (conclusion), not background.
- **C) Correct!** The Pyramid Principle requires "present top-down" — your main answer or recommendation comes first, followed by supporting arguments and data. This structure respects the reader's time.
- **D) Incorrect.** The analysis process is how you think (bottom-up), but you present top-down with the conclusion first. Never make readers follow your thinking process.

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**

**Answer:** B

### Q4: Pyramid Principle Three Rules
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Bloom's Level:** Remembering

According to the lecture, which of the following is one of the three rules of the Pyramid Principle?

A) Ideas above must summarize those below
B) All arguments must use the same data source
C) Documents should be at least 3 pages long
D) Supporting points must be arranged alphabetically

**Answer:** A

**Feedback:**
- **A) Correct!** This is Rule 1 of the Pyramid Principle — ideas at any level must summarize the ideas grouped below them. This allows readers to stop at any level.
- **B) Incorrect.** The Pyramid Principle doesn't require using the same data source. Rule 2 states grouped ideas must be logically the same kind, not from the same source.
- **C) Incorrect.** The Pyramid Principle has no length requirement. It's about structure, not document length.
- **D) Incorrect.** Rule 3 states ideas must follow logical order (chronological, structural, comparative, or deductive) — not alphabetical order.

### Q5: Strunk & White Author

- **C) Incorrect.** Matt Abrahams wrote about the "What/So What/Now What" framework, not *The Elements of Style*.
- **D) Incorrect.** Elizabeth Danziger wrote about the Purpose-Person-Point framework in HBR, not *The Elements of Style*.

### Q6: SCQA Components Matching
**Type:** Matching
**Bloom's Level:** Remembering

Match each SCQA component to its description:

**Components:**
1. Situation (S)
2. Complication (C)
3. Question (Q)
4. Answer (A)

**Descriptions:**
A) The problem or change creating urgency
B) Your recommendation (the pyramid top)
C) Indisputable context the audience accepts
D) What naturally arises from the complication

**Answer:**
- 1 → C (Situation = Indisputable context)
- 2 → A (Complication = Problem creating urgency)
- 3 → D (Question = What arises from complication)
- 4 → B (Answer = Your recommendation)

**Feedback:**
- **Situation (S) = C:** Establishes factual, neutral baseline everyone agrees on. No debate here.
- **Complication (C) = A:** Introduces the problem, change, or tension that creates urgency and makes your message relevant.
- **Question (Q) = D:** The natural question readers ask after hearing the complication. Should arise organically from tension.
- **Answer (A) = B:** Your governing thought or recommendation — becomes the top of your Pyramid Principle structure.

### Q7: Why Pyramid Principle Works
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Bloom's Level:** Understanding

Why does the Pyramid Principle recommend leading with conclusions rather than building to them?

A) Because conclusions are always longer than supporting arguments
B) Because readers trust you've done the analysis and want the answer first
C) Because chronological order is confusing to executives
D) Because it makes documents look more professional

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Length has nothing to do with the Pyramid Principle's logic. Conclusions are often shorter than arguments.
- **B) Correct!** The lecture explains that readers trust you've done the bottom-up thinking. They want the answer first (top-down presentation) so they can choose how deep to go. This respects their time.
- **C) Incorrect.** While executives prefer concise communication, the Pyramid Principle isn't specifically about avoiding chronological order — it's about presenting conclusions first.
- **D) Incorrect.** The Pyramid Principle is about clarity and reader processing, not visual professionalism. It works because it matches how minds process information.

### Q8: MECE Principle Purpose
**Type:** True/False
**Bloom's Level:** Understanding

**Statement:** In the MECE principle, "Mutually Exclusive" means arguments can overlap as long as they collectively cover all relevant points.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
**False is correct:** "Mutually Exclusive" means arguments must NOT overlap — each must be distinct with no redundancy. The lecture example showed "Increase revenue" and "Expand into new markets" violate MECE because they overlap (expansion is one way to increase revenue). Arguments must be both mutually exclusive (no overlap) AND collectively exhaustive (cover everything).

**True is incorrect:** This contradicts the definition of "Mutually Exclusive." If arguments overlap, they violate MECE's first requirement. The principle requires both separation (mutually exclusive) AND completeness (collectively exhaustive).

### Q9: Active Voice Benefits
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Bloom's Level:** Understanding

Why does the lecture recommend using active voice in business writing?

A) Because passive voice is grammatically incorrect
B) Because active voice clarifies responsibility and sounds more confident
C) Because active voice always makes sentences shorter
D) Because passive voice is only used in academic writing

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Passive voice is grammatically correct and has limited uses (when the actor is unknown or irrelevant). The issue is clarity, not correctness.
- **B) Correct!** The lecture explains that active voice clarifies who is responsible ("We recommend" vs. "It is recommended") and sounds more confident. Business writing should be 80%+ active voice.
- **C) Incorrect.** While active voice often shortens sentences, this isn't always true. The main benefit is clarity of responsibility, not length.
- **D) Incorrect.** Passive voice appears in many writing contexts. The lecture notes it can signal evasion in business writing ("Mistakes were made" avoids blame).

### Q10: Specificity in Business Writing
**Type:** True/False
**Bloom's Level:** Understanding

**Statement:** According to Strunk & White's Rule 3, using vague qualifiers like "significantly," "many," and "soon" undermines credibility because readers want specific, measurable information.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
**True is correct:** The lecture teaches "Use definite, specific, concrete language" as Rule 3. Vague language (e.g., "Sales increased significantly") makes readers ask "How much?" Specific language (e.g., "Sales increased 23% quarter-over-quarter") builds credibility by demonstrating expertise and giving readers data for decisions.

**False is incorrect:** Specificity is central to professional business writing. The lecture explicitly contrasts vague ("many customers complained") with specific ("47 customers filed complaints — 15% of total base") to show how specificity builds trust.
