**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

A) The logical structure of your argument
B) The emotional impact on your audience
C) Your credibility and character as a speaker
D) The specific action you want the audience to take

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**

- **B) Incorrect.** Emotional impact is "pathos," not ethos. Ethos concerns the speaker's credibility and trustworthiness.
- **C) Correct!** Ethos refers to the speaker's credibility—why the audience should trust you. This includes expertise, common ground, character, and demonstrating understanding of the audience.
- **D) Incorrect.** The specific action is the "call to action." Ethos is about establishing credibility before you make your ask.

**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In Cialdini's principles of persuasion, what does "Reciprocity" refer to?

A) People prefer to interact with those who are similar to them
B) People feel obligated to return favors and concessions
C) People look to others' actions to guide their own behavior
D) People value what is rare or diminishing

**Answer:** B

- **B) Correct!** Reciprocity means people feel obligated to return favors and concessions. The lecture cited the restaurant study where tips increased 23% when mints were given as "personalized gifts."
- **C) Incorrect.** This describes "Social Proof"—people following others' behavior. Reciprocity is about returning favors.
- **D) Incorrect.** This describes "Scarcity," not Reciprocity. Reciprocity creates obligation through giving first.

### Q5: Social Proof Principle
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

Which Cialdini principle was demonstrated by the hotel towel study showing that "Most guests in this room reuse their towels" increased reuse by 33%?

A) Reciprocity
B) Authority
C) Social Proof
D) Unity

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Reciprocity involves giving first to create obligation. The hotel study showed people following others' behavior (Social Proof).
- **B) Incorrect.** Authority involves deferring to experts or credentials. The hotel study used peer behavior, not authority.
- **C) Correct!** This demonstrates Social Proof—people look to others' actions to guide their own behavior, especially "similar others" (guests in the same room). The message shifted from generic request to showing what peers do.
- **D) Incorrect.** Unity involves shared group identity. While related, the hotel study specifically demonstrates Social Proof through showing peer behavior.

### Q6: Balancing Rhetorical Appeals
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Nancy Duarte's research, presentations that are too analytical (all logos, no pathos) risk being forgettable and failing to inspire action.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Duarte's research shows that presentations relying solely on logic and data (logos) without emotional connection (pathos) tend to be boring, unmemorable, and fail to drive action. Balance is essential—audiences need logic AND emotion.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. Duarte's 2024 MIT Sloan article specifically warns against being "too analytical." While business audiences expect data, logos alone feels like reading a spreadsheet and doesn't inspire action. Balance across ethos, pathos, and logos is necessary.

### Q7: SUCCESs - Concrete Principle
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

In the movie popcorn campaign example, why was saying "A medium popcorn has more fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, Big Mac lunch, and steak dinner combined" more effective than saying "Movie popcorn is unhealthy"?

A) It used authority by citing nutritional experts
B) It created scarcity by suggesting limited healthy options
C) It made the abstract concept concrete through vivid, specific comparison
D) It appealed to social proof by showing what others avoid

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The example doesn't cite experts—its power comes from concrete comparison. This demonstrates the SUCCESs "Concrete" principle, not Authority.
- **B) Incorrect.** There's no scarcity element here. The effectiveness comes from making "unhealthy" tangible through specific comparison.
- **C) Correct!** This demonstrates the SUCCESs "Concrete" principle. "Unhealthy" is abstract and dismissible, but comparing to three full meals creates a vivid, tangible image that people can't ignore. Concrete details are more memorable and persuasive than abstractions.
- **D) Incorrect.** The example doesn't reference what others do. It uses concrete comparison to make abstract health claims tangible and believable.

### Q8: Commitment and Consistency Principle
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Cialdini's Commitment and Consistency principle, written commitments are more powerful than verbal commitments.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Cialdini's research shows that written commitments create stronger obligation than verbal ones. The lecture cited the health clinic study where having patients write their own appointment cards reduced no-shows by 18%. Writing activates commitment more powerfully.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. Research demonstrates that written commitments (signing, writing down goals) create stronger psychological obligation than verbal promises. The health clinic study showed 18% reduction in no-shows when patients wrote appointment cards themselves.

### Q9: Four-Step Change Storytelling Framework
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to Frei & Morriss (Harvard Business Review, 2023), which step in change storytelling involves acknowledging organizational history to reduce resistance?

A) Understand deeply, describe simply
B) Honor the past
C) Articulate a persuasive mandate
D) Lay out a rigorous and optimistic path forward

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This step focuses on simplifying complex change into clear terms, not acknowledging history. "Honor the past" is the step that addresses organizational history.
- **B) Correct!** "Honor the past" specifically involves acknowledging organizational history to build credibility and reduce resistance. The Domino's case study showed this: "We built this company on speed and value—that was right for the time" validated past decisions before proposing change.
- **C) Incorrect.** This step builds urgency for change, not acknowledgment of history. "Honor the past" comes before explaining why change is needed now.
- **D) Incorrect.** This step provides the implementation roadmap. "Honor the past" is the separate step that acknowledges organizational history.

### Q10: Effective Call to Action Characteristics
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

Which of the following is an example of a strong call to action (CTA) based on the lecture's guidelines?

A) "I hope you'll think about this proposal"
B) "Let me know if you have questions"
C) "Please approve Phase 1 pilot budget ($5,000) by Friday so we can begin testing with Marketing department next week"
D) "We should implement this at some point"

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This CTA is vague ("think about") with no specific action or timeline. Strong CTAs are specific, measurable, and time-bound.
- **B) Incorrect.** This puts the burden on the audience and requests no specific decision. Strong CTAs ask for one clear action.
- **C) Correct!** This CTA is specific (approve Phase 1 budget), measurable ($5,000), time-bound (by Friday), single action (one approval), and includes rationale (begin testing next week). It demonstrates all characteristics of effective CTAs.
- **D) Incorrect.** This CTA lacks specificity (what exactly to implement) and has no timeline ("at some point"). Strong CTAs are concrete and time-bound.
