### Q2: Vietnam's Power Distance Score
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Hofstede's cultural dimensions, what is Vietnam's Power Distance Index (PDI) score and how is it classified?

A) 40 (Low)
B) 57 (Moderate)
C) 70 (High)
D) 92 (Very High)

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Vietnam has significantly higher power distance than 40. A score of 40 is similar to the USA, which has low power distance.
- **B) Incorrect.** 57 is Vietnam's Long-Term Orientation score, not Power Distance. Vietnam's PDI is higher.
- **C) Correct!** Vietnam scores 70 on Power Distance, which is classified as High. This means Vietnamese culture accepts hierarchical society where managers expect obedience and junior staff respect seniority.
- **D) Incorrect.** While 70 is high, it's not as extreme as 92. Countries like Ukraine score in the 90s for power distance.

### Q3: Psychological Safety Definition
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

According to Amy C. Edmondson (1999), how is psychological safety defined?

A) Trust in your teammates to complete their assigned tasks
B) A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking
C) Group cohesiveness and friendliness among team members
D) The feeling of being comfortable and relaxed in meetings

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This describes trust, not psychological safety. Trust is about expectations of others' future actions, while safety is about team climate for risk taking.
- **B) Correct!** Edmondson defines psychological safety as "a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking"—asking questions, admitting mistakes, challenging ideas.
- **C) Incorrect.** Group cohesiveness can actually reduce psychological safety by creating groupthink. Safety requires comfort with disagreement, not just friendliness.
- **D) Incorrect.** Psychological safety is more specific than general comfort. It's about feeling safe to take interpersonal risks like challenging the status quo or admitting errors.

A) Aim to Assist
B) Actionable
C) Ask First
D) Acknowledge Emotions

**Answer:** D

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect answer choice.** "Aim to Assist" IS one of the Three A's—give feedback only with genuine intention to help, never to vent frustration.

- **C) Incorrect answer choice.** "Ask First" IS one of the Three A's—request feedback on your own work before giving feedback to others.
- **D) Correct!** The three A's are Aim to Assist, Actionable, and Ask First. "Acknowledge Emotions" is not part of Meyer's framework, though emotional awareness matters in cross-cultural communication.

### Q5: The Four Zones Framework
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Remembering

In Edmondson's Four Zones framework, which zone represents the optimal combination of high psychological safety and high accountability?

A) Comfort Zone
B) Learning Zone
C) Anxiety Zone
D) Performance Zone

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** The Comfort Zone has high safety but LOW accountability—teams are safe but complacent with no pressure to perform.
- **B) Correct!** The Learning Zone combines high psychological safety (everyone can speak up) with high accountability (everyone delivers on commitments). This is the optimal zone for innovation and execution.
- **C) Incorrect.** The Anxiety Zone has high accountability but LOW safety—fear-driven work that leads to burnout and politics.
- **D) Incorrect.** "Performance Zone" is not one of Edmondson's four zones. The four are: Comfort, Learning, Anxiety, and Apathy.

### Q6: Hofstede's Cultural Programming
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

According to Hofstede's definition, culture is innate (biologically inherited) rather than learned from one's social environment.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Incorrect. Hofstede defines culture as "collective programming of the mind" that is LEARNED, not innate. Culture is acquired from social environment (family, school, workplace), not inherited genetically.
- **If answered False:** Correct! Hofstede emphasizes that culture is learned, not innate. It's acquired through social environment and can be understood and navigated. This is why cross-cultural communication skills can be developed.

### Q7: Personal vs. Contextual Diversity
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to Taras et al. (2021), what is the primary difference in how personal diversity and contextual diversity affect team performance?

A) Personal diversity improves task quality, while contextual diversity affects team satisfaction
B) Personal diversity primarily affects psychological outcomes, while contextual diversity improves task outcomes
C) Personal diversity is easier to manage than contextual diversity
D) Personal diversity always leads to negative performance, while contextual diversity always helps

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** This reverses the actual relationship. Contextual diversity (different backgrounds/expertise) improves task quality, while personal diversity (demographics) affects psychological outcomes.
- **B) Correct!** Personal diversity (age, gender, race, personality) primarily affects psychological outcomes like satisfaction and conflict. Contextual diversity (country, industry, functional expertise) improves task outcomes like quality and creativity.
- **C) Incorrect.** The research doesn't claim one is easier to manage than the other. Both require active management, but they affect different aspects of team performance.
- **D) Incorrect.** The relationship isn't absolute. Personal diversity can be negative WITHOUT active management but isn't always negative. Contextual diversity generally improves performance but requires psychological safety to realize benefits.

### Q8: Upgraders vs. Downgraders
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

In Meyer's Culture Map framework, what is the purpose of "downgraders" (words like "kind of," "maybe," "sort of") in indirect feedback cultures like Vietnam and Thailand?

A) To show uncertainty about the correctness of the feedback
B) To preserve harmony and save face while still communicating criticism
C) To make the speaker sound less educated and professional
D) To confuse the listener so they work harder to understand

**Answer:** B

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Downgraders aren't about uncertainty—they're about delivery style. The speaker knows the message; downgraders soften the emotional impact to preserve relationships.
- **B) Correct!** In indirect feedback cultures, downgraders soften criticism to preserve harmony and save face. Saying "maybe this approach is not quite ideal" communicates the same content as "this is wrong" but protects relationships.
- **C) Incorrect.** Downgraders are a professional norm in indirect cultures, not a sign of poor education. They demonstrate cultural competence and emotional intelligence.
- **D) Incorrect.** The purpose isn't confusion—it's face-saving. Members of indirect cultures understand the criticism clearly; downgraders simply reduce the emotional threat.

### Q9: Gender Egalitarianism and Power Distance
**Type:** True/False
**Category:** Understanding

Gender Egalitarianism (high) and Absence of Power Distance (low PDI) are the two most important cultural factors for positive team outcomes because they both enable psychological safety, the number one predictor of team effectiveness.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
- **If answered True:** Correct! Both Gender Egalitarianism (equal voice regardless of gender) and low Power Distance (junior members can challenge seniors) create conditions where team members feel safe speaking up. This psychological safety is what Google's Project Aristotle found to be the #1 factor distinguishing high-performing teams.
- **If answered False:** Incorrect. This statement is accurate. When everyone's ideas are valued equally (regardless of gender) and hierarchy is flat (junior members can challenge seniors), people feel comfortable asking questions, admitting mistakes, and offering creative ideas—all hallmarks of psychological safety.

### Q10: Meyer's Culture Map Position for Vietnam
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Category:** Understanding

According to Meyer's Culture Map, where does Vietnam fall on the scale of direct vs. indirect negative feedback, and what does this mean for Vietnamese professionals working with Western colleagues?

A) Position 1-2 (Most direct)—Vietnamese should maintain their direct style
B) Position 4 (Moderately direct)—No adaptation needed when working with Americans
C) Position 7 (Most indirect)—Vietnamese need to adapt by being more explicit with Western cultures
D) Position 5-6 (Moderately indirect)—Vietnamese are already similar to Western feedback styles

**Answer:** C

**Feedback:**
- **A) Incorrect.** Germany and Netherlands are at positions 1-2 (most direct). Vietnam is at the opposite end of the spectrum, using heavy downgrader language to preserve harmony.
- **B) Incorrect.** Position 4 represents USA/Australia (moderately direct). Vietnam is much more indirect, positioned at the extreme end of the scale (position 7).
- **C) Correct!** Meyer positions Vietnam at position 7—the most indirect end alongside Thailand and Japan. Vietnamese culture uses "say the good, leave out the bad" philosophy. When working with Western colleagues (positions 1-5), Vietnamese professionals need to adapt by being more explicit, adding clarity, and stating concerns directly.
- **D) Incorrect.** Vietnam is at position 7, not 5-6. Brazil, Mexico, and India fall at positions 5-6. Vietnam is significantly more indirect than these cultures and requires greater adaptation when working with Western colleagues.
